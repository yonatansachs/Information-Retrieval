introduction
algorithmic
fairness
is
scholarly
field
aimed
at
ensuring
equity
in
algorithmic
decision
making
with
dedicated
measures
algorithms
and
auditing
procedures
many
of
the
key
findings
in
this
field
have
been
data-driven
therefore
the
quality
of
datasets
employed
in
research
and
practice
are
central
to
the
validity
of
experiments
and
to
the
generalization
of
results
in
algorithmic
fairness
downstream
effects
of
data
issues
triggered
by
poor
practice
that
undervalues
data
quality
are
both
common
and
avoidable
10
noisy
inaccurate
or
otherwise
non-representative
data
inevitably
affect
the
reliability
and
utility
of
findings
11
12
algorithmic
fairness
as
whole
stands
to
gain
from
improvements
in
its
prevalent
data
practices
recent
work
has
shown
that
algorithmic
fairness
articles
frequently
use
off-the-shelf
datasets
13
fabris

call
into

the
suitability
of
these
benchmark
datasets
in
algorithmic
fairness
documenting
over
200
alternative
datasets
that
have
been
employed
in
the
field
in
this
work
we
develop
search
engine
that

aims
to
empower
the
algorithmic
fairness
community
enabling
principled
approaches
to
select
datasets
for
research
development
and
critical

studies
our
longterm
goal
is
to
support
easily
accessible
up-to-date
search
along
relevant
axes
updating
and
maintaining
this
resource
with
new
datasets
will
certainly
be
challenge
we
call
on
the
algorithmic

community
the
key
stakeholders
of
this
work
to
contribute
with
guidance
and
collaboration
to
