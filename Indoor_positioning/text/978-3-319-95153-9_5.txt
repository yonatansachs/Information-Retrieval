Abstract. Navigatingdifferent devices andhumanbeingsin indoor scenehas
become very crucial for number of tasks specially in automated system. The
efficiencyofoutdoorpositioninghasbecomeexcellentduetothedevelopment
of GPS. However lots of mass market applications require very excellent
positioning capabilities in almost every environments. As a result, indoor
positioning has attracted the researchers attention and has been a focus of
research during the past decades. This paper presents an overview of the four
typicalindoorlocalizationschemesnamelytriangulation,trilateration,proximity
and scene analysis are analyze and discussed. Moreover it gives a detailed
survey of different positioning systems which are being both research-oriented
solutions and commercial products and also attempts to classify the different
systemsintodifferentgroupsbasedonthetechnologyused.Wecategorizedall
11 sighted wireless indoor positioning systems into 6 distinct technologies
namely Infrared signals, radio frequency, ultrasound waves, vision-based anal-
ysis, electromagnetic waves, and audible sound and explains the measuring
principles of each. These approaches are characterized and their key perfor-
manceparametersarequantifiedindividually.Forabetterunderstanding,these
parameters arebriefly comparedin table form for eachsystem so as to outline

1 Introduction
An Indoor positioning system (IPS) is a continuous and real-time system which can
decide the position of someone or something in a physical space (i.e. gymnasium,
hospital, school, etc.) [1]. IPs has been widely researched study area for many years
now. As a service, IPs has still not attain through global use as broadly compared to
outdoor positioning services. Outdoor positioning is usually based on GPS satellite
signals. In GPS [2], the location is approximated by computing the transit time of the
signal from satellite to client device. When time and satellite position is known, the
schemecan then computethe distance between user and satellite. Inindoors,situation

is more complicated. Because GPS signals cannot penetrate through building walls
good enough for accurate indoor positioning, other technologies has to be used or
combinedwiththeGPSsystem.Thoseothertechnologiesinclude:WLAN,Bluetooth,
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and more. Indoors is a very dynamic envi-
ronment,withlotofmovingpeopleandinsomeplacesevenobstaclestend tomovea
lot. There are some basic techniques and technologies used in indoor positioning.
Theseincludetrilateration,triangulation(angleofarrival),RSSbasedpositioning,time
of arrival and fingerprinting. An overview of different existing technology options for
the design of an positioning scheme As an example Infrared, ultrasound, RFID,
WLAN, sensor networks, Bluetooth, UWB, vision analysis, magnetic signals and
audible sound are explained in [1, 3]. Considering these key technologies, different
localization systems have been formulated by different companies, higher institutions
and research departments. This paper introduced and explained various
research-oriented and commercially available indoor positioning systems. We also

2 Survey on Wireless Indoor Positioning/Localization
Techniques and Systems
Therehavebeenanumberofsurveysbydifferentresearchersaboutindoorpositioning
techniques and systems in the literature. This section describes literatures on indoor
positioning, technologies, techniques and systems. Moreover various rating criterions
are considered to examine the different indoor positioning systems for the services
demanded by the users/required by the client.
2.1 Wireless Indoor Positioning Techniques
2.1.1 Triangulation
This algorithm is used find out the position of the target having the geometrical con-
ceptsoftrianglesandthetargetplacecanbeestimated/computedbyusingthelocations
of three or more access points. Whenever the target devices receives the signals from
one or more access points, the TOA, AOA and RSS of the signals will be utilized to
estimate the distances between the target and the access points. The angle defines the
estimated position of the target as illustrated in Fig. 1 below.

2.1.2 Trilateration
This approach [3, 4] determines the location of the target by measuring its distances
from multiple reference points. The object in the field is located by creating a system
which uses radio frequency signals. This RSS (radio frequency signal strength) is
measured between the tagged object and the readers that are positioned in the field.
Then the signal strength will be converted into a distance using the distance formula
shown in Eqs. (1), (2) and (3) and plugged into a system known as trilateration. By
using this approach we can determine the tagged object on the x, y plane (2D latera-
tion) as well as x, y and z plane (3D lateration).

2.1.3 Scene Analysis
Aprincipleofpositioningapproachinwhichfirstacquire/gatherfingerprintsofascene
andthendeterminesanobjectpositionbymatchingwiththeinformationexistinginthe
database [4]. The offline and online phases are the two phases offingerprinting tech-
nique [5]. Strengths from access points are collected at reference points during the
training phase, while in the tracking phase, user’s surrounding access point signal
strengths are compared/analyzed with the RP dataset collected in the 1st phase for
matching.
2.1.4 Proximity
This approach investigates the location of an object with respect to a distinguished
position by sensing its location [3]. Moreover, this approach requires a connection
between the mobile and fixed node to track the target so that the tracked target is
considered/assumed as in the proximity area.
2.2 Range Measurement Techniques
(1) Received Signal Strength: This scheme can achieve a maximum value when the
gap between transmitter and receiver is smaller so as to investigate the distance.
Thisschemeisusedtolocatethespace/distanceofthesubscriberunitfromother
setofmeasurementunitsbyusingtheattenuatedoutputofemittedsignalstrength
for calculating the signal loss.
(2) Time of Arrival: The propagation time of signal is approximately equal to the
distance between the measurement units and the targeted object. A precise syn-
chronization of all the transmitters and receivers and at least three measurement
units are required to obtain 2D lateration.
(3) Time Difference of Arrival: This Technique estimates the relative position of the
mobile transmitter by determining the difference of the signal arival time at
number of measurement units. For example, 3 fixed receivers can give two
TDOAs, which estimates position of the targeted object.
(4) PhaseofArrival:Thistechniqueestimatesthedistanceofatargetusingthesignal
delay which is expressed as the fraction of signal wavelength. In this technique,
the transmitters are needed to be placed at particular locations to perform the
location of the target based on phase measurements.Survey onIndoorPositioning Techniques andSystems 51
(5) AngleofArrival:Useantennaearraysatthereceiversidetoestimate theangleat
which the transmitted signal impinges on the receiver by calculating TDOA at
individual elements of the antennae array. It requires the measurement of at least
twoangleswithdirectionorientedorarrayofantennastoestimatethe2Dlocation
of a target.
2.3 Criterias for Evaluating Wireless Indoor Positioning Systems
(1) PrivacyandSecurity:OneoftheevaluationcriteriaforagoodIPSisitssecurity
and privacy because both of them are very important [6] for Private as well as
Social activities for controlling the positioning information and history. To
improveprivacyinIPSlocationaswellasinformationshouldbecontrolledfrom
the software or system architecture side [3].
(2) Cost: The most important factors which can determine the cost of a positioning
system are money, time, space, weight and energy [3]. Installation and mainte-
nance are related to time factor. Mobile units may have weight and tight space
constraints. The final important factor of a system cost is energy.
(3) Performance:Forevaluating theperformanceofan IPSsprecision andaccuracy
areveryimportant.Thesuccessprobabilityofpositionlocalizationwithrespectto
predefinedaccuracyisprecision.Accuracyistheaverageerrordistance[3].Other
performance parameters are calculated positioning delay of targeted object,
measurement transformation of targeted object and scalability.
(4) FaultToleranceandRobustness:Eventhoughsomeequipmentsinthesystemare
notworkingorhaveadeadbatteryenergy,arobustIPSshouldabletooperateand
tolerable during the occurrence offaults in the system [3].
(5) Complexity:AgoodIPSisasystemwithoptimumperformance(accuracy),easily
usedsoftwareplatformsandanexistedinfrastructuredevicesfortheusers[7].The
users device computational time for determining their position is another aspect
which indicates complexity.
(6) User Preference: A good IPSs always assumes the clients’ requirement of the
targeted equipments, the infrastructures and the software. If the devices are
lightweight, wireless, small, lower power consumption and computationally
powerful, the system has a chance to be preferred by the user.
(7) Commerciallyexisted:FromthedevelopedIPSswhicharediscussedinSect. 2.4,
some of them are existing in the market and others are still researching.
(8) Limitations: The medium which are used for position sensing is the fundamental
limitations of IPSs. For example, WLAN technology can reuse the existing
infrastructure. However, position sensing based on radio frequency has
multiple-path and has a reflection effects which result in maximum error.

2.4.2 Ultra-Sound Positioning Systems
Active Bat: This scheme is developed by AT&T Cambridge and can offer 3D posi-
tioning for the tracked tags [10]. In this system ultrasonic technology receivers is
requiredtocomputethe3Dlocationofthetagbymultiple-laterationandtriangulation.
A tag frequently broadcasting pulse of ultrasound that will be catched by a matrix of
receivers at an acknowledged position. The distance measurement is obtained by the
ultrasonic signal TOA. The system acquires installing 720 receivers to the ceiling to
cover a 1000 m2 area. The system has 3 cm accuracy for 75 tracked tags.
Cricket: This system uses ultrasound system as infrastructure mounted on the
walls/ceilings at acknowledged location and receiver are attaching on the individual
targeted object [11] for using TOA method and triangulation technique to identify the
targeted object. This approach offers privacy for the client by accomplishing all the
location triangulation computation of targeted object so as to own its location infor-
mation. This scheme offers 10 cm accuracy.
Sonitor: ThissystemisdevelopedbySonitorTechnologiesInc.forindoorpositioning
and tracking solution based on an ultrasound technology [12]. The system can offer
locationidentificationandtrackingofpeoplesandequipmentsany-timeandproviding
proximitypositionalinformationwithroomlevelaccuracyduetotheultrasoundsignal
(i.e. Ultrasound signal cannot penetrate walls and does not need LOS transmission).
Thus the scheme is used for detecting and tracking hidden targets.
2.4.3 Radio Frequency (RF) Positioning Systems
(I) WLAN: These scheme/technology has been deployed in public areas (i.e. hospi-
tals, train stations, universities, etc.). The followings are some of the WLAN
technology based IPSs..Survey onIndoorPositioning Techniques andSystems 53
Radar: This system is suggested by a Microsoft research group as tracking
method using WLAN infrastructure [13]. The system utilizes signaling strength
and SNR with the triangulation. The Radar system can offer 2D information.
Compas: This system takes an advantages/merits of existing WLAN
technology/infrastructures and digital compasses to give high and accurate ser-
viceswithconsiderablecostforaclientholdingaWLAN-basedequipments[14].
Estimating/calculation the position is depend on the measurement of the signal
strength from different APs. This scheme uses the fingerprint method
determine/estimate the position of a client [14].
(II) UWB:TheUWBofferhigheraccuracybecauseits[15]pulseshaveshortduration
(less than 1 nano seconds) and this pulses are used for filtering the reflected
signalsfrom the original signal. Ubisense is an UWB based scheme as discussed
below.
Ubisense:ThissystemisdesignedbyAT&TCambridge,whichoffersareal-time
scheme [16]. In this system the triangulation technique is employed by taking
advantages of both the TDOA AOA to provide flexible location sensing. This
scheme cannot be affected by a complicated environment (i.e. walls, doors, etc.)
[16]. The accuracy offered is about tens of centimeters.
2.4.4 Magnetic Positioning System
MotionStarWireless: ThissystemisdesignedbyAscensionTechnologyCorporation,
whichisusedtotrackthetargetedobjectwithapulsedDCmagneticfieldsforlocating
sensors within 3 m area/coverage [17]. This scheme offers accurate motion tracker by
the measurement of different sensors attached on the body of a person. The system
tracks multiple targets (120 sensors) at a time in real time.
2.4.5 Vision-Based Positioning System
Easy Living: This system is vision based and developed by Microsoft research group
[18].Two cameras (stereo) attaching on theceiling of aroom isneeded andthe entire
part oftheroom iscovered byonecamera.Two3D cameras (real-time)cancover the
measuring area and offer real-time visions (which can be used as an input for location
estimations).Thenthecomputerreceivesthephotosfrom thecamerasandprocessthe

theentranceoftheroom(aplacewherethestereomodulecreatesthevisioninstanceof
theperson).Thus,whenapersongetsintotheroom,theschemetracksthemotionof
the person and publish the information of the person.
2.4.6 Audible Sound Positioning System
Beep: This system is an audible sound based technology and designed as a cheap 3D
IPS method [19]. This scheme uses Triangulation technique with a standard 3D mul-
tiple lateration based on TOA.54 H.M.Hussien etal.
3 Comparison of Wireless Indoor Positioning Systems
In this section, the aforementioned different existed IPSs are evaluated from the point
of view of the client interest. IPSs are compared considering the evaluation criterias
which has been discussed in Sect. 2.3 Table 1 shown below depicts evaluation and
comparison results and thus results are important so as to to easily identify the best
location methods.

4 Conclusion
Fromthispaper,readers cangetadetailedunderstandingofthedifferent existed IPSs,
especially the 11 IPSs explained in this paper. The existing IPSs are classified into 6
categories based on the main technology used to sense the location. Moreover, the
systemarchitectureandworkingprinciplesarepresented.Eighthavebeenproposedto
so as to and compare the IPSs from the point of view of the client.
5 Recommendation
Fromthispaper,wehaveseenthateachtechnologyusedinpositiondeterminationhas
its own drawbacks. None of them can fulfill the system demand. Therefore we rec-
ommendthatinsteadofusingasinglemediumtoestimatethelocationsofthetargets,It
will be good combining some technologies so as to enhance the quality of services
ratherusingasingletechnology.ForinstanceWLANandUWB.WhereWLANtcover
large area and UWB can give highly accurate calculation.
