introduction
over
the
past
decade
artificial
intelligence
ai
has
transformed
nearly
every
aspect
of
our
society
including
higher
education
the
rapid
deployment
of
ai
into
higher
education
has
changed
the
educational
experience
for
students
faculty
and
administrators
chan

ai
technologies
have
been
applied
in
various
educational
settings
to
increase
efficiency
in
administrative
processes
improve
personalized
teaching
and
learning
and
support
research
activities
using
ai
in
these
different
educational
settings
indicates
its
ability
to
potentially
transform
education
in
significant
ways
despite
its
powerful
and
profound
impact
on
higher
education
there
has
been
growing
concern
in
the
academia
about
the
use
of
ai
with
the
emergence
of
large
language
models
llms
such
as
chatgpt
bing
and
geminia
there
are
also
questions
about
ai
ethics
in
education
as
access
to
ai
via
large
language
models
has
increased
significantly
in
the
last
few
years
sam

2023
with
the
increase
in
access
to
ai
universities
now
have
to
consider
how
to
teach
students
to
engage
with
ai
ethically
in
coursework
research
and
careers
the
universities
also
need
to
decide
what
uses
of
ai
constitute
violations
of
academic
integrity
and
what
norms
need
to
be
established
about
ai
these
questions
sparked
debate
about
the
principles
and
values
that
should
guide
the
development
and
use
of
ai
which
led
many
higher
education
institutions
to
draft
ai
policy
and
guidelines
for
responsible
use
of
ai
hence
in
this
paper
we
examined
emerging
ai
policies
and
guidelines
from
the
colleges
and
universities
via
combination
of
thematic
and
structured
content
analysis
to
identify
policy
and
ethical
concerns
as
well
as
the
institutional
structures
that
shape
restrictions
rights
and
interventions
following

of

background
with
the
increase
in
access
to
ai
governments
worldwide
have
been
developing
national
policies
and
strategies
to
offer
clearer
guidelines
on
ai
usage
aiming
to
maximize
its
benefits
while
minimizing
associated
risks
these
governments
have
been
trying
to
address
key
issues
such
as
ai
discrimination
and
bias
privacy
breaches
human
rights
violations
and
the
malicious
use
of
ai

most
national

prioritized
the
discussion
of

to
promote
responsible
and
appropriate
management
of
ai
technologies
focusing
on
determining
what
is
morally
acceptable
or

hogenhout
2021
many
of
these
national
ai
policies
have
referred
to
floridi

framework
for
the
ethical
use
of
ai
which
emphasized
five
core
principles
beneficence
non-maleficence
autonomy
justice
and
explicability
additionally
dexe
and
franke
2020
reviewed
ai
strategy
documents
from
nordic
countries
and
identified
various
ethical
principles
as
the
implicit
foundation
for
policy
development
their
study
also
provides
insights
into
the
unique
approaches
and
priorities
of
nordic
ai
policies
which
explores
their
efforts
to
balance
innovation
with
ethical
considerations
in
the
ai
landscape
scholars
have
also
started
examining
the
content
of
ai
ethics
documents
in
public
private
and
non-governmental
sectors
for
instance
jobin

identified
several

in

documents
transparency
justice
fairness
nonmaleficence
responsibility
and

similarly
schiff
et

2021
assessed
more
than
100
documents
from
public
private
and
non-governmental
sectors
through
the
analysis
of
25
ethical
topics
that
they
developed
through

the
study
highlighted
the
different
ethical
considerations
that
arise
in
the
development
adoption
and
governance
of
ai
technologies
across
different
sectors
in
addition
floridi
and
cowls

argued
that
the
47
ai
ethics
principles
they
reviewed
align
with
traditional
bioethics
principles
like
beneficence
and
justice
along
with

of

overall
previous
studies
on
ai
ethics
have
predominantly
focused
on
assessing
the
extent
to
which
global
consensus
on
ai
ethics
is
emerging
recently
ai
has
also
emerged
as
transformative
force
in
higher

prompting
universities
around
the
world
to
establish
policies
ethics
frameworks
and
guidelines
to
govern
its
development
and
deployment
in
recent
years
scholarly
discourse
has
extensively
addressed
key
issues

in
the
evolving

of
ai
policy
and

in
higher

to
address
the

by

previous

emphasized
the
growing

of

education
in

this

highlighted
the
significance
of

the

also
suggest
the
need
to
address
ethical
concerns
such
as

this

and
ensures
that

which
poses

challenges
this
research
concluded
that
whether

of

constitutes

or
academic

depends
on
whether
the

discloses
their
