abstract
historical
precedents
suggest
that
the
basic
issues
underlying
the
debate
about
network
neutrality
dealing
with
the
balance
between
efficiency
and
fairness
in
markets
will
never
be
resolved
should
net
neutrality
dominate
attention
would
likely
turn
to
other
parts
of
the
economy
that
might
be
perceived
as
choke
points
for
economic
activities
such
as
net
search
traditionally
the
balance
between
efficiency
and
fairness
that
was
struck
by
policy
makers
depended
heavily
on
cost
considerations
when
service
was
expensive
to
provide
fairness
was
deemphasized
in
the
current
discussion
of
network
neutrality
this
issue
appears
to
be
unduly
neglected
introduction
as
yogi
berra
and
others
are
supposed
to
have
said
it
tough
to
make
predictions
especially
about
the
future
this
definitely
applies
to
society
reaction
to
technology
history
is
full
of
mistaken
predictions
as
just
one
example
decade
ago
sergey
brin
and
larry
page
brin
and
page
1998
claimed
that
the
goals
of
the
advertising
business
model
do
not
always
correspond
to
providing
quality
search
to
users
we
expect
that
advertising
funded
search
engines
will
be
inherently
biased
towards
the
advertisers
and
away
from
the
needs
of
the
consumers
we
believe
the
issue
of
advertising
causes
enough
mixed
incentives
that
it
is
crucial
to
have
competitive
search
engine
that
is
transparent
and
in
the
academic
realm
however
messrs
brin
and
page
realized
their
mistake
and
went
on
to
achieve
fame
and
wealth
building
google
which
at
least
so
far
has
managed
to
be
just
what
they
had
predicted
was
impossible
an
extraordinarily
successful
search
engine
that
is
supported
by
ads
and
is
both
proprietary
and
extraordinarily
opaque
this
is
common
pattern
in
the
history
of
technology
that
even
the
inventors
and
promoters
of
an
innovation
have
mistaken
notions
of
the
impact
it
will
have
on
society
yet
often
they
do
succeed
in
spite
of
this
as
another
example
of
this
phenomenon
in
the
early
years
of
railroads
it
was
widely
expected
that
their
spread
would
severely
cut
back
on
horse
populations

stimulated
horse
breeding
since
rails
were
great
for
transport
once
one
got
to
them
but
the
first
mile
problem
of
reaching
those
rails
required
horses
while
detailed
predictions
appear
impossible
most
of
the
time
there
are
certain
persistent
trends
in
history
one
of
these
trends
is
that
some
mistakes
keep
getting
made
again
and
again
in
spite
of
all
the
experiences
of
previous
centuries
telecom
seems
especially
prone
to
this
tendency
as
is
discussed
below
which
makes
it
possible
to
predict
that
many
ventures
will
fail
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
about
difficulty
of
prediction
but
complicates
planning
in
other
ways
related
persistent
trend
is
that
controversies
can
frequently
be
classified
into
certain
patterns
that
recur
over
and
over
again
this
trend
which
applies
to
the
net
neutrality
debate
strongly
suggests
that
the
basic
issue
involved
in
it
is
not
going
to
disappear
the
issue
is
how
much
control
service
providers
should
have
over
the
bits
that
society
relies
on
so
much
the
net
neutrality
issue
has
been
pronounced
dead
and
buried
several
times
but
it
has
bounced
back
typically
when
service
provider
said
or
did
something
that
struck
some
people
as
outrageous
thus
at
the
end
of
2005
ed
whitacre
of
sbc
now
renamed

when
asked
about
business
prospects
of
companies

how
do
you
think
they
re
going
to
get
to
customers
through
broadband
pipe
cable
companies
have
them
we
have
them
now
what
they
would
like
to
do
is
use
my
pipes
free
but
ain
going
to
let
them
do
that
because
we
have
spent
this
capital
and
we
have
to
have
return
on
it
so
there
going
to
have
to
be
some
mechanism
for
these
people
who
use
these
pipes
to
pay
for
the
portion
they
re
using
why
should
they
be
allowed
to
use
my
pipes
the
internet
can
be
free
in
that
sense
because
we
and
the
cable
companies
have
made
an
investment
and
for
google
or
yahoo
or
vonage
or
anybody
to
expect
to
use
these
pipes
for
free
is
nuts
this
led
to
extensive
protests
and
discussions
that
appeared
to
peter
out
after
while
however
at
the
end
of
2007
comcast
stirred
up
new
round
of
controversy
by
spoofing
packets
to
disrupt
peer-to-peer
p2p
transmissions
of
its
customers
the
net
neutrality
debate
is
often
pictured
as
contest
between
the
two
most
prominent
corporate
champions
of
the
opposing
sides
at
and
google
but
the
underlying
issue
predates
both
companies
by
centuries
it
was
never
resolved
completely
since
it
arises
from
conflict
between
society
drives
for
economic
efficiency
and
for
fairness
there
is
no
reason
to
expect
that
this
conflict
will
lessen
and
instead
there
are
arguments
that
suggest
it
will
intensify
should
something
like
net
neutrality
prevail
the
conflict
would
likely
move
to
different
level
that
level
might
become
search
neutrality
and
allegations
about
discriminatory
behavior
of
web
search
provider
have
surfaced
recently
in
china
tschang
2009
or
to
take
another
currently
popular
concept
if
cloud
computing
does
become
as
significant
as
its
enthusiasts
claims
it
could
lead
to
dominance
of
single
service
provider
the
effective
monopoly
of
that
dominant
player
could
then
become
perceived
as
far
more
insidious
than
any
of
the
walled
gardens
or
intelligent
network
that
telcos
would
like
to
build
this
brief
note
outlines
some
of
the
issues
related
to
net
neutrality
and
the
controversies
that
might
replace
it
it
concludes
by
raising
key
question
that
appears
missing
from
the
current
net
neutrality
debates
it
is
that
of
quantitative
discussion
of
just
how
much
it
costs
to
build
out
and
run
broadband
network
whether
such
network
can
be
viable
under
net
neutrality
and
if
not
how
far
away
from
net
neutrality
should
one
expect
or
allow
service
providers
to
depart
what
is
acknowledged
whether
explicitly
or
implicitly
in
most
discussions
of
net
neutrality
is
that
the
basic
issue
is
of
price
discrimination
there
are
frequent
claims
about
41
review
of
network
economics
vol
issue
march
2009
the
need
to
manage
network
traffic
but
when
one
gets
deeper
into
them
one
typically
finds
complaints
about
of
the
users
generating
50
of
the
traffic
and
the
like
which
have
less
to
do
with
providing
adequate
service
and
more
with
way
to
apportion
the
cost
and
the
usual
practices
that
have
been
observed
have
tended
to
be
more
about
restricting
some
applications
than
about
managing
congestion
say
for
example
consider
the
comcast
vs
bittorrent
affair
that
surfaced
in
2007
the
fcc
in
its
order
to
comcast
to
end
its
practices
federal
communications
commission
2008
noted
that
comcast
was
throttling
bittorrent
traffic
even
when
there
was
no
congestion
while
allowing
heavy
users
to
carry
out
unimpeded
even
during
peak
congestion
periods
as
long
as
they
were
not
using
bittorrent
and
comcast
changed
its
story
several
times
when
its
previous
explanations
were
found
to
be
at
variance
with
facts
now
it
is
true
that
this
fcc
decision
was
by
to
vote
and
one
of
the
opponents
commissioner
mcdowell
noted
in
his
dissent
that
the
evidence
was
thin
and
conflicting
with
further
complaints
about
lack
of
signed
statements
and
the
like
so
perhaps
the
fcc
decision
was
wrong
in
its
statement
of
facts
but
the
description
in
federal
communications
commission
2008
is
typical
of
what
one
finds
in
history
companies
engaging
in
discriminatory
practices
try
to
conceal
it
dissemble
when
caught
and
cite
various
seemingly
less
objectionable
objectives
safety
performance
etc
as
the
reasons
for
their
policies
very
seldom
do
they
come
out
and
admit
what
they
are
doing
it
should
be
emphasized
that
from
the
standard
economic
point
of
view
there
is
nothing
nefarious
about
attempting
to
introduce
differential
charging
it
is
just
that
social
acceptability
of
such
practices
is
at
wide
variance
with
the
recommendations
of
the
conventional
economic
models
there
are
many
precedents
for
price
discrimination
in
all
commerce
and
in
transportation
and
communication
in
particular
with
more
control
service
providers
can
obtain
more
funding
which
may
be
used
to
build
out
networks
but
in
the
context
of
net
neutrality
this
issue
is
not
discussed
very
extensively
and
when
it
is
it
is
treated
in
curiously
one-side
manner
just
about
discriminating
among
content
providers
and
without
specifying
just
how
much
discrimination
is
needed
service
providers
argue
that
they
can
finance
the
buildout
of
broadband
networks
only
by
charging
extra
fees
to
parties
such
as
google
but
so
far
the
main
change
that
has
taken
place
in
the
aside
from
few
providers
interfering
with
p2p
transmissions
is
that
in
some
states
telephone
companies
have
won
the
right
to
deploy
broadband
only
in
those
neighborhoods
they
choose
there
are
some
provisions
about
not
discriminating
against
the
poor
but
those
are
vague
and
almost
surely
unenforceable
traditionally
both
cable
and
telephone
companies
had
obtained
the
right
to
string
their
wires
in
municipalities
by
promising
to
serve
every
one
in
each
area
equally
but
that
was
not
always
so
in
the
early
days
of
the
telephone
industry
see
gabel
1987
if
broadband
networks
are
horrendously
expensive
to
build
as
is
often
implied
should
one
perhaps
go
further
and
make
the
price
depend
on
the
income
of
the
user
that
is
how
harvard
education
is
priced
after
all
there
is
list
price
of
about
45
000
per
year
and
families
with
incomes
up
to
180
000
per
year
as
announced
at
year-end
2007
can
obtain
discounts
by
giving
up
their
financial
privacy
and
submitting
detailed
accounting
of
their
income
and
assets
so
we
might
price
basic
internet
connectivity
at
000
per
month
with
discounts
for
those
who
cannot
afford
that
much
and
are
willing
to
reveal
detailed
financial
information
such
policy
could
also
be
accompanied
by
additional
charges
for
every
bit
that
is
actually
transmitted
with
the
charge
determined
by
the
value
of
that
particular
transaction

comparing
internet
access
to
college
tuition
may
be
extreme
but
it
helps
frame
the
discussion
by
exhibiting
the
whole
range
of
network
access
and
pricing
policies
there
is
range
of
net
neutrality
choices
at
one
end
depending
on
the
definition
of
net
neutrality
one
chooses
and
harvard-like
policy
at
the
other
which
policy
will
be
sufficient
to
produce
the
networks
that
will
be
needed
contrary
to
many
claims
of
opponents
of
net
neutrality
networks
are
not
very
expensive
to
build
as
will
be
discussed
later
and
some
simple
calculations
suggest
that
net
neutral
communications
infrastructure
could
be
viable
economically
but
such
an
infrastructure
might
enable
even
more
extreme
forms
of
price
discrimination
by
players
such
as
google
and
might
then
lead
to
new
controversies
and
demands
for
new
forms
of
regulation
the
value
of
bits
and
content
versus
connectivity
it
helps
to
consider
how
much
value
is
attached
to
different
types
of
bits
now
value
is
hard
to
define
there
is
market
value
different
in
different
markets
and
use
value
so
as
proxy
let
us
consider
how
much
users
pay
for
various
telecommunication
services
we
then
come
up
with
listing
that
looks
something
like
table
these
are
just
prices
paid
and
so
do
reflect
varying
costs

approximate

the

in

not
be
taken
as
too
precise
they
were
chosen
to
be
nice
round
numbers
that
are
in
approximately
the
right
ranges
for
example
it
appears
that
sms
messages
might
be
something
like
30
bytes
on
average
and
in
much
of
the
world
they
cost
about
0.10
each
which
results
in
price
of
000
per

but
that
is
close
to
the

listed
many
of
these
services
especially
in
the
are
sold
in

topic
to
be
covered
in
much
more
detail
below
so
per-unit
or

pricing

not
visible
to
the
users
but
generally
speaking
residential
user
who
transmits
gb

and
pays

figures
that
seem
typical
for
some
countries
is
effectively

similarly
small

that
has
to
purchase
access
to

and
pays

which
would
be
high
price
in
the
as
this

is
being
written

some

all

43

can
be
defended
with
data
as
approximately
correct
usually
within
factors
of
two
or
three
it
is
the
great
orders
of
magnitude
disparities
between
them
that
are
of
interest
price
per
bit
is
just
one
measure
of
communication
service
one
should
also
keep
in
mind
profits
since
that
is
what
drives
investments
and
total
revenues
it
appears
that
nothing
in
telecom
is
at
the
profit
levels
of
wireless
texting
aside
possibly
from
ring
tone
downloads
or
services
such
as
caller
id
this
helps
explain
why
the
telcos
are
attracted
to
walled
garden
approaches
where
they
hope
to
obtain
similarly
high
profits
from
narrowly
defined
services
note
also
that
the
basic
search
ad
services
of
google
generate
very
little
traffic
but
are
extremely
profitable
leading
to
the
google
envy
that
appears
to
be
driving
so
much
of
current
telecom
planning
but
in
terms
of
revenues
an
estimated
7080
of
worldwide
telecom
revenues
come
from
voice1
with
wireless
increasingly
dominating
and
the
bulk
of
the
remainder
is
from
other
connectivity
services
such
as
texting
or
to
the
extent
one
can
allocate
revenues
from
internet
access
from
email
in
particular
this
all
by
itself
suggests
that
the
claims
of
high
level
at
manager
wilson
2006
that
net
neutrality
is
about
streaming
movies
is
mistaken
if
anything
net
neutrality
and
the
future
of
telecom
in
general
are
far
more
about
voice
and
the
services
that
will
succeed
voice
in
importance
in
particular
the
key
issue
is
how
to
extract
payment
from
customers
when
voice
the
most
valuable
service
they
receive
is
free
feature
of
the
basic
broadband
connectivity
they
buy
the
comment
that
net
neutrality
is
about
streaming
movies
is
reflection
of
two
fundamental
and
very
deeply
ingrained
false
myths
one
of
them
is
that
content
is
king
this
was
the
key
motivator
behind
european
service
providers
throwing
away
about
100
billion
euros
almost
150
billion
at
today
exchange
rates
on
3g
spectrum
auctions
and
then
more
on
top
of
that
for
misdirected
technology
development
and
deployment
the
promise
was
that
wireless
content
services
movies
music
location
based
services
and
the
like
would
double
average
monthly
revenues
yet
even
superficial
look
at
history
would
have
shown
the
content
is
king
myth
to
be
false

connectivity

the
other
false
myth
embedded
in
the

quote
is
that

should
be
delivered
in
real-time

mode
video
is
already
very
large
fraction
of

traffic
and
it
appears
that
an
increasing
fraction
is
being

there
is
little

except
for
ingrained
prejudices
why
that
should
be
so
with

the
primary
ones
it
is

more
effective
in
terms
of
providing
quality

in
keeping
the

inexpensive

faster

but
this
myth
is
also
deeply
ingrained
and
seems
impossible
to
dislodge
so
it
is
likely
to
continue
misleading
both
service
providers
and
policy
makers
service
providers
will
build
out
expensive
networks
designed
for
streaming
video
that
will
waste
their
shareholders
and
their
customers
money
and
policy
makers
will
worry
about
how
to
regulate
such
features
the
combination
of
deeply
embedded
but
false
myths
about
communications
combined
with
general
inability
to
predict
both
developments
in
technology
and
society
reaction
to
technology
mean
that
no
fixed
set
of
rules
is
likely
to
be
satisfactory
as
reality
will
be
intruding
and
making
the
best
laid
plans
irrelevant
but
some
of
the
issues
that
will
be
controversial
seem
very
easy
to
predict
in
particular
the
degree
of
price
discrimination
that
service
providers
are
allowed
to
practice
price
discrimination
precedents
the
wide
disparities
in
prices
seen
in
table
help
explain
the
strong
incentives
towards
price
discrimination
that
exist
similar
incentives
have
existed
for
ages
and
they
frequently
led
to
differential
pricing
both
in
communications
see
for
example
odlyzko
2001b
or
the
more
detailed
discussion
in
odlyzko
2000
and
in
transportation
odlyzko
2004a
as
just
one
example
let
us
note
that
in
1829
the
toll
schedule
on
the
stockton
and
darlington
railway
the
pioneering
locomotive-powered
public
railway
had
charges
of
0.5
old
english
pence
per
ton
per
mile
for
coal
destined
for
shipment
out
of
the
region
pence
per
ton
per
mile
for
coal
for
use
in
the
region
and
pence
per
ton
per
mile
for
general
merchandise
table
on
83
of
kirby
1993
this
is
just
one
of
myriad
examples
one
can
cite
for
others
see
jackman
1916
odlyzko
2004a
for
example
but
it
does
illustrate
several
relevant
points
one
is
that
charges
were
dependent
not
just
on
the
nature
of
the
cargo
but
also
on
its
destination
so
we
had
something
similar
to
today
much
disliked
and
feared
deep
packet
inspection
and
there
were
attempts
to
conceal
nature
of
some
shipments
with
penalties
imposed
when
detected
another
is
that
such
charges
were
not
the
result
of
simple
economic
optimization
but
often
involved
heavy
politics
in
particular
the
low
charges
for
coal
destined
for
shipment
were
the
result
of
coal
mine
owners
in
different
region
trying
to
avoid
competition
from
the
coal
mines
that
the
stockton
and
darlington
railway
was
to
serve
see
kirby
1993
for
details
they
persuaded
parliament
to
impose
what
they
thought
was
an
unprofitable
rate
that
would
ruin
this
line
and
yet
another
lesson
about
difficulty
in
forecasting
technology
is
that
this
attempt
failed
since
those
coal
mine
owners
did
not
anticipate
progress
in
railway
development
correctly
and
the
supposedly
ruinous
rate
turned
out
to
work
quite
well
finally
yet
another
lesson
is
that
although
the
stockton
and
darlington
tolls
differed
substantially
according
to
the
nature
of
freight
and
whether
it
was
destined
for
shipment
or
for
in-region
use
they
were
otherwise
uniform
not
distinguishing
between
shippers
or

locations
being
based
strictly
on
mileage
this
represented
the
other
major
factor
to
be
discussed
later
namely
that
price
discrimination
has
traditionally
been
disliked
and
feared
and
has
usually
been
strictly
limited
in
view
of
the
historical
precedents
for
price
discrimination
in
communication
and
transportation
some
of
the
arguments
of
net
neutrality
proponents
are
questionable
for
example
vint
cerf
of
google
has
claimed
mohammed
2006
that
since
both
residential
users
and
companies
like
google
pay
for
access
to
the
internet
it
would
be
unfair
for
access
providers
to
step
in
the
middle
and
create
toll
road
to
limit
customers
ability
to
get
access
to
services
of
their
choice
yet
such
tolls
have
been
frequent
and
have
often
been
used
to
shift
costs
of
the
entire
communication
system
around
note
that
table
shows
that
communication
between
residential
user
and
google
costs
about
100
times
as
much
to
the
user
as
to
google
the
differential
is
likely
much
more
than
100
since
google
may
very
well
be
getting
free
connections
to
some
access
providers
using
its
own
fiber
or
wavelengths
such
arrangements
probably
cost
much
less
than
the
transit
fees
that
were
used
in
computing
the
numbers
in
that
table
but
in
the
past
in
the
traditional
voice
telephone
network
business
customers
frequently
paid
far
more
than
residential
ones
sometimes
this
was
voluntary
as
in
the
provision
of
toll-free
numbers
but
most
of
the
time
especially
high
charges
for
businesses
were
imposed
on
them
this
started
out
with
the
very
first
telephone
service
the
private
company
that
controlled
the
bell
invention
used
its
patent-protected
monopoly
to
simply
demand
twice
as
much
for
business
uses
of
the
telephone
as
for
personal
use
odlyzko
2000
this
policy
of
charging
business
customers
extra
continued
under
regulation
as
rough
approximation
it
appears
that
back
about
half
century
ago
business
customers
in
the
paid
about
two-thirds
of
the
cost
of
the
telephone
network
and
residential
users
for
one-third
over
the
last
decade
the
balance
appears
to
have
shifted
and
so
corporations
are
escaping
the
burden
they
used
to
bear
whether
that
is
good
or
not
is
another
issue
thus
from
historical
perspective
there
is
nothing
novel
about
service
providers
attempting
to
erect
toll
booths
and
charge
extra
for
traffic
to
and
from
google
the
marketplace
is
full
of
various
indirect
payment
arrangements
in
principle
it
would
not
be
any
more
unusual
for
google
to
pay
access
providers
to
allow
residential
customers
to
connect
to
the
whole
internet
and
not
just
to
google
than
it
is
for
advertisers
to
pay
google
to
provide
search
results
to
end
users
who
in
most
cases
do
not
pay
anything
to
those

privacy
and

the
incentives
for
differential
charging
are
well
understood
but
seldom
discussed
in
public
however
they
are
discussed
in
private
as
one
example
an
antitrust
lawsuit
made
public
an
email
of
aug
21
1997
from
warren
buffett
the
sage
of
omaha
to
jeff
raikes
of
microsoft
in
which
buffett
wrote
that
alexander
graham
bell
should
have
anticipated
bill

and
let
someone
else
put
in
the

while
he
collected
by

and
even

alexander

did
not
collect
by
the
importance
of

call
however
he
or
rather
the
company
that
he
helped
start
with
his
patents
certainly
did
charge
by
the
minute

which

and

rationale
for
distance-sensitive
charges
in
postal
systems
before
the
penny
post
reform
and
history
does
record
instances
of
telephone
companies
attempting
to
restrict
usage
of
hotel
phones
to
hotel
employees
there
was
even
telco
protest
against
the
use
of
telephone
to
alert
the
fire
department
to
fire
on
neighbor
property
on
the
grounds
that
the
phone
was
for
personal
use
only
odlyzko
2000
so
the
incentives
to
price
discriminate
have
been
understood
for
long
time
and
were
frequently
pursued
to
the
extent
and
often
beyond
that
allowed
by
technology
and
law
technology
was
often
limiting
factor
as
rich
man
could
dress
in
rags
when
showing
up
for
train
or
coach
ride
and
could
send
servant
to
buy
goods
at
low
prices
further
rules
and
regulations
also
often
interfered
with
what
sellers
might
have
wanted
to
do
the
information
and
communication
technologies
revolution
and
the
internet
in
particular
are
leading
to
unprecedented
opportunities
for
differential
charging
buyers
willingness
to
pay
can
be
estimated
from
detailed
knowledge
of
their
behavior
and
their
usage
can
be
monitored
and
restricted
thus
inhibiting
resale
which
has
been
traditional
escape
route
from
extreme
forms
of
differential
pricing
the
thesis
proposed
in
odlyzko
1996
and
odlyzko
2003a
is
that
the
growing
erosion
of
privacy
can
be
explained
by
companies
preparing
to
exploit
the
growing
opportunities
for
price
discrimination
but
employing
price
discrimination
is
like
playing
with
fire
as
is
shown
by
past
experience
fair
and
efficient
markets
there
are
strong
incentives
for
fine-scale
differential
pricing
with
the
holy
grail
of
commerce
system
in
which
every
item
or
service
component
is
priced
at
the
buyer
maximal
willingness
to
pay
but
there
are
also
several
countervailing
tendencies
they
include
the
generic
benefits
of
bundling
which
is
how
flat
rate
services
can
be
viewed
one
of
the
great
ironies
of
the
communications
industry
is
that
one
segment
fights
against
attempts
to
make
it
unbundle
cable
tv
channel
at
the
same
time
most
of
the
industry
keeps
complaining
that
flat
rates
are
unsustainable
on
the
internet
and
elsewhere
and
supports
development
and
deployment
of
technologies
such
as
ims
that
could
make
finegrained
charging
feasible
and
yet
all
this
time
flat
rates
are
spreading
but
in
addition
there
is
the
willingness
of
users
to
pay
more
for
flat
rates
as
well
as
the
substantial
effect
that
flat
rates
have
in
stimulating
usage
these
factors
are
described
in
detail
in
fishburn
et
al
1997
levinson
and
odlyzko
2008
odlyzko
2000
and
odlyzko
2001b
they
frequently
swamp
the
incentives
towards
fine-scale
discriminatory
pricing
in
what
may
be
perceived
as
another
triumph
of
behavioral
economics
over
the
standard
economic
models
it
appears
likely
that
for
relatively
inexpensive
goods
and
services
that
are
used
frequently
flat
rates
or
other
simple
pricing
plans
are
often
of
benefit
to
sellers
this
issue
would
not
be
considered
further
here
except
to
note
that
these
effects
have
been
visible
in
communications
at
least
since
the
penny
post
reform
in
britain
in
1840
and
that
the
telecom
industry
has
refused
to
learn
from
them
hence
it
is
safe
to
predict
that
service
provider
policies
as
well
as
regulation
will
often
be
misdirected
through
ignorance
of
such
effects
the
main
constraint
on
price
discrimination
comes
from
society
dislike
of
the
practice
this
dislike
is
reflected
in
customs
laws
and
regulations
society
has
struggled
for
centuries
with
the
conflicting
incentives

to
allow
differential

in

to
stimulate

other

economy
essentially
untrammelled
markets
were
allowed
to
operate
subject
to
minor

and
related
constraints
and
the
discrimination
that
arose
there
was
tolerated
but
for
key
communication
and
transportation
industries
that
was
not
regarded
as
adequate
and
common
carriage
was
the
doctrine
that
was
applied
common

served
to
limit
discrimination
but
in
nod
to
economic
incentives
did
not
prohibit
discrimination
entirely

has
been
waived
for
internet
services
but
it
could
easily
come
back
and
even
more
stringent
constraints
could
come
the
interesting
comparison
is
with
that
great
revolutionary
technology
of
the
19th
century
the
railroads
they
were
subject
to
common
carriage
rules
from
the
beginning
not
only
that
but
their
early
charters
had
embedded
in
them
structural
separation
similar
to
the
one
that
prevailed
on
canals
the
railroad
company
was
expected
to
provide
rail
road
and
have
carriers
use
their
own
wagons
and
motive
power
but
this
quickly
broke
down

the
privileges
and
rights
contemplated
as
well
by
the
companies
as
by
parliament
were
merely
those
necessary
to
enable
them
to
construct
and
maintain
road
which
was
to
be
open
to
all
who
might
desire
to
use
it

of

colossal
monopoly
never
contemplated
by
parliament
nor
foreseen
by
the
companies
themselves
had
come
into

but
even
when
vertical
integration
was
conceded
to
railways
they
were
constrained
to
charges
that

of

after
discussion
of
how
valuable
differential
pricing
would
be
for
particular
railways
that
the
people
of
kent
will
never
rest
satisfied
with
the
public
will
not
tolerate
the

would
grant
remedy
for
the
correction
of
scheme
with
high
per-mile
fares
on
some
routes
and
low
fares
on
others
so
even
though
the
economic
incentives
pointed
towards
differential
pricing
according
to
route
and
those
would
have
helped
to
spread
the
network
more
widely
this
observer
was
not
willing
to
go
that
far
although
he
was
supportive
of
differing
charges
for
different
classes
of
passenger
service
and
for
different
types
of
freight
the
vertical
integration
followed
by
railroads
in
getting
into
carriage
of
goods
and
passengers
was
usually
justified
on
the
grounds
of
safety
railroad
managers
complained
they
could
not
protect
life
and
limb
unless
they
controlled
the
entire
operation
on
their
line
and
they
did
have
evidence
to
support
their
contention
just
as
today
telecom
service
providers
argue
they
need
fine
scale
control
over
the
packet
traffic
in
order
to
prevent
malicious
attacks
assure
customers
of
decent
connections
etc
but
it
appears
that
much
of
the
motivation
for
the
vertical
integration
of
railroads
came
from
the
greater
profit
opportunities
that
railroads
saw
in
operating
that
way
this
is
shown
both
by
the
occasional
quotes
from
managers
and
the
fact
that
railroads
did
manage
to
operate
their
trains
over
the
lines
of
other
railroads
with
which
they
had
friendly
business
relationships
this
was
an
early
instance
of
the
phenomenon
demonstrated
to
hold
in
telecom
century
and
half
later
that
in
the
absence
of
clear
boundary
it
is
hard
to
regulate
complicated
system
if
the
main
operators
do
not
wish
to
cooperate

what
was
desperately
needed
was
remedy
for
the
evils
of
unjust
discrimination
against
one
locality
in
favor
of
another
or
in
favor
of
one
description
of
trade
at
the
expense
of
another
and
of
uncertainty
and
favoritism
by
means
of
special
contracts
rebates
drawbacks
and
the
thousand
and
one
other
means
by
which
rich
and
powerful
company
may
by
the
secret
adjustment
of
rates
impose
upon
the
public
the
complaints
were
not
just
about
level
of
railroad
charges
which
were
declining
quite
rapidly
during
the
1870s
the
concern
was
more
about
the
fairness
of
the
system
contemporary
comment
on
the
situation
was
voiced
in
hadley
1885
but
the
fact
that
the
charges
are
so
low
does
not
make
differences
in
charge
bear
any
less
severely
upon
business
difference
of
five
cents
per
bushel
in
the
charge
for
transporting
wheat
thousand
miles
is
small
matter
taken
by
itself
it
would
be
weeks
before
it
would
make
difference
of
one
cent
to
the
individual
consumer
of
bread
but
if
railroad
makes
this
reduction
for
one
miller
and
not
another
it
will
be
enough
to
drive
the
latter
out
of
business
the
dislike
of
price
discrimination
has
deep
and
still
poorly
understood
roots
see
odlyzko
2003a
for
some
references
at
the
level
of
individuals
even
people
who
receive
discounts
are
often
suspicious
as
to
whether
they
are
being
treated
fairly
for
example
but
there
is
also
deeper
concern
that
arises
when
differential
pricing
becomes
widespread
and
remains
opaque
concern
that
affects
the
moral
foundations
of
free
market
in
the
case
of
19th
century
railroads
society
led
by
business
groups
demanded
more
transparent
and
level
playing
field
the
setting
where
monopoly
infrastructure
business
in
pursuit
of
its
own
ends
could
take
arbitrary
steps
that
would
ruin
one
business
and
make
another
succeed
were
regarded
as
inimical
to
really
free
market
it
resembled
far
too
much
the
widely
disliked
markets
without
property
rights
dominated
by
capricious
political
power
so
what
followed
was
long
period
of
increasingly
stringent
regulation
critics
later
complained
about
regulatory
capture
in
which
the
regulated
industries
controlled
the
regulated
and
that
was
certainly
true
those
industries
did
gain
stability
while
society
gained
precarious
sense
of
fairness
it
was
precarious
since
the
differential
pricing
incentives
could
not
be
ignored
completely
and
all
those
legions
of
lawyers
and
economists
argued
about
myriad
of
cases
as
various
players
tried
to
push
the
boundaries
of
acceptable
behavior
some
economic
efficiency
was
lost
at
least
in
the
short
term
but
that
seemed
to
be
regarded
as
acceptable
future
of
pricing
the
history
of
railroads
suggests
some
general
trends
in
how
pricing
will
develop
odlyzko
2003a
one
is
that
the
differential
pricing
incentive
will
continue
to
operate
and
that
sellers
will
continue
pressing
against
and
often
transgressing
whatever
rules
are
set
up
railroad
history
is
full
of
examples
of
companies
pledging
to
refrain
from
price
discrimination
either
because
of
new
laws
or
because
of
voluntary
cartel
arrangements
with
their
competitors
and
then
immediately
breaking
such
pledges
the
eager
reception
that
technologies
such
as
deep
packet
inspection
ims
and
others
receive
from
service
operators
surely
reflects
this
tendency
to
what
extent
such
technologies
are
actually
going
to
be
used
is
another
question
there
will
be
much
experimentation
to
see
what
society
will
accept
the
harvard-like
policy
might
be
the
dream
for
all
sellers
but
will
seldom
be
achieved
and
certainly
not
in
the
near
future
starbucks
will
not
suddenly
declare
that
the
price
of
cup
of
coffee
will
be
49
review
of
network
economics
vol
issue
march
2009
or
depending
on
how
much
starbucks
thinks
particular
individual
might
be
able
and
willing
to
pay
based
on
that
person
history
of
starbucks
purchases
as
well
as
income
and
assets
with
standard
list
price
of
10
per
cup
for
those
who
insist
on
remaining
anonymous
but
note
that
prescription
drugs
in
the
are
approaching
that
type
of
pricing
on
the
other
hand
starbucks
and
other
coffee
shops
there
is
nothing
special
about
starbucks
will
likely
experiment
with
what
is
nowadays
called
behavioral
targeting
in
which
individuals
get
customized
ads
depending
on
variety
of
factors
the
ones
that
are
usually
cited
are
time
of
day
and
proximity
to
the
nearest
store
but
the
incentive
will
clearly
be
to
incorporate
into
the
creation
of
these
ads
particular
individuals
willingness
and
ability
to
pay
so
for
example
lover
of
starbucks
coffee
who
is
not
price
sensitive
might
receive
on
his
cell
phone
discount
coupons
that
average
0.50
per
cup
while
somebody
who
does
not
care
whether
he
drinks
coffee
from
starbucks
or
mcdonald
might
get
discount
offers
of
1.50
the
offers
will
vary
from
instance
to
instance
so
they
will
not
always
be
0.50
and
1.50
for
those
individuals
making
it
harder
to
detect
what
is
happening
but
the
average
discounts
will
be
different
and
will
enable
sellers
to
realize
some
of
the
benefits
of
the
ideal
form
of
differential
pricing
this
may
sound
like
brave
new
world
but
glimpses
of
it
do
occasionally
appear
for
example
consider
the
descriptions
of
car
dealer
network
in
grow
and
epstein
2007
that
does
not
post
prices
and
determines
what
to
offer
to
its
poor
and
financially
unsophisticated
customers
based
on
detailed
information
about
their
position
and
of
course
we
do
have
harvard
and
other
elite
private
schools
that
practice
extreme
forms
of
differential
pricing
and
medical
care
appears
to
be
moving
in
that
direction
odlyzko
2003a
we
do
not
know
exactly
what
forms
of
price
discrimination
society
will
accept
so
we
should
expect
experimentation
hidden
as
much
as
sellers
can
manage
but
occasionally
erupting
in
protests
and
those
protests
leading
to
sellers
pulling
back
at
least
partially
and
occasionally
we
should
expect
government
action
when
the
protests
grow
severe
however
based
on
historical
precedents
we
should
expect
governments
to
often
pay
lip
service
to
public
demands
while
in
practice
tolerating
and
even
promoting
differential
pricing
because
of
its
positive
economic
effects
see
odlyzko
2003a
how
to
justify
google
stock
price
the
precise
form
that
price
discrimination
will
take
is
impossible
to
predict
and
the
starbucks
scenario
above
is
just
one
way
the
future
can
be
approached
but
there
is
huge
potential
in
it
and
it
may
be
what
has
led
to
the
huge
stock
market
valuation
of
google
serving
up
the
standard
online
ads
has
turned
out
to
be
extremely
profitable
in
another
instance
of
the
difficulty
of
technological
predictions
this
is
contrary
to
general
expectations
as
recently
as
the
peak
of
the
internet
bubble
in
2000
when
the
consensus
was
that
such
ads
were
not
promising
revenue
source
and
there
are
plenty
more
ads
that
can
migrate
online
but
there
are
limits
since
the
advertising
field
is
not
all
that
large
the
total
amount
spent
on
advertising
is
lower
than
spending
on
voice
telephony
but
if
behavioral
targeting
can
be
exploited
extensive
price
discrimination
would
open
up
entirely
new
and
much
larger
revenue
sources
enterprises
already
spend
on
direct
marketing
and
other
promotions
amounts
comparable
to
what
they
spend
on
ads
and
effective
differential
pricing
could
replace
and
augment
that
and
the
company
in
control
of
the
process
the
one
with
the
information
about
customers
and
in
control
of
the
delivery
50
review
of
network
economics
vol
issue
march
2009
of
the
offers
could
potentially
end
up
in
control
of
product
pricing
essentially
relegating
the
good
and
service
providers
to
commodity
role
the
profit
potential
of
such
role
is
gigantic
yet
another
way
that
google
could
justify
its
high
valuation
would
be
if
the
current
hype
about
cloud
computing
becomes
reality
if
most
of
our
data
and
computing
migrate
into
distributed
network
of
processors
and
storage
entirely
new
opportunities
would
arise
given
the
economics
and
the
technology
with
the
first
mover
advantage
economies
of
scale
and
similar
factors
cloud
computing
could
easily
become
dominated
by
one
or
handful
of
players
who
might
then
have
huge
power
and
corresponding
profit
potential
and
google
is
ideally
positioned
to
grab
such
role
since
its
core
expertise
is
in
deploying
distributed
information
technology
infrastructure
in
either
scenario
though
google
or
yahoo
or
microsoft
or
facebook
or
some
other
entity
that
might
reach
position
to
exploit
its
position
in
the
ways
outlined
here
would
have
to
tread
very
carefully
since
the
public
could
easily
decide
its
practices
amounted
to
being
evil
for
google
or
some
other
entity
to
fully
exploit
the
potential
of
differential
pricing
or
of
cloud
computing
and
the
latter
would
surely
also
involve
extensive
price
discrimination
it
is
necessary
to
have
communications
infrastructure
that
either
that
entity
controls
or
that
is
approximately
net
neutral
otherwise
the
communications
network
could
grab
the
profits
by
charging
differential
fees
to
google
that
would
absorb
most
of
the
benefits
or
could
deploy
its
own
competing
cloud
which
might
be
less
efficient
but
could
exclude
competitors
fairness
and
rules
the
basic
conclusion
is
that
whether
at
or
google
wins
the
net
neutrality
battle
the
outcome
at
high
level
may
be
similar
namely
society
exposed
to
the
prospect
of
an
unprecedented
degree
of
discrimination
it
is
doubtful
that
competition
could
mitigate
the
risks
on
one
hand
there
is
doubt
whether
one
could
have
viable
system
with
enough
separate
physical
networks
for
effective
competition
we
already
have
in
most
of
the
united
states
two
separate
networks
the
case
is
made
below
that
there
are
already
sufficient
revenues
to
allow
both
networks
to
deliver
high
speed
connectivity
but
duopoly
can
hardly
be
expected
to
provide
competitive
market
on
the
other
hand
it
does
not
seem
feasible
to
pay
for
five
separate
physical
networks
say
and
even
if
one
could
get
enough
funding
one
would
then
have
to
face
the
issue
that
surfaced
prominently
with
railroads
about
170
years
ago
namely
whether
such
wasteful
duplication
would
be
preferable
to
the
inefficiency
of
regulation
or
government
ownership
it
is
not
even
clear
whether
duopoly
would
be
stable
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
not
even
certain
that
the
wireline
networks
will
continue
to
maintain
their
revenues
since
it
is
voice
connectivity
that
is
the
most
valuable
service
and
voice
is
rapidly
migrating
to
wireless
in
cyberspace
the
winner
take
all
phenomenon
is
very
pronounced
and
in
addition
in
the
online
world
strategic
gaming
and
tacit
collusion
are
easy
as
the
electric
power
crisis
in
california
demonstrated
recently
furthermore
we
have
extensive
historical
evidence
that
competition
often
leads
to
increases
in
price
discrimination
to
what
extent
the
winner
of
the
net
neutrality
debate
might
actually
be
able
to
exploit
the
opportunities
that
victory
would
offer
will
depend
on
how
people
react
it
is
not
just
the
51
review
of
network
economics
vol
issue
march
2009
existing
laws
and
regulations
that
matter
but
public
reaction
because
one
of
the
key
lessons
from
the
past
is
that
governments
do
respond
to
popular
concerns
about
the
functioning
of
markets
people
have
often
called
on
governments
to
intervene
when
they
got
upset
with
what
they
perceived
as
unfair
rules
whether
that
intervention
takes
place
through
laws
regulations
or
courts
intervening
to
invoke
common
carriage
rules
is
different
question
and
will
surely
differ
from
country
to
country
as
it
has
in
the
past
we
see
this
happening
today
in
the
european
mandate
to
lower
international
roaming
fees
in
wireless
voice
blau
2007
on
purely
economic
grounds
those
high
fees
can
easily
be
justified
since
they
are
charged
on
the
calls
that
are
likely
to
be
most
valuable
and
that
those
high
discriminatory
fees
existed
even
in
competitive
market
shows
something
that
has
been
visible
for
long
time
namely
that
competition
is
not
necessarily
barrier
to
price
discrimination
but
they
offended
the
public
sense
of
fairness
and
so
they
are
being
reduced
through
explicit
government
mandates
and
the
threat
of
such
mandates
people
did
not
resort
to
the
technical
means
of
circumventing
those
fees
but
instead
insisted
on
changing
the
rules
of
the
marketplace
hence
we
should
not
take
the
general
lack
of
concern
about
their
privacy
by
people
as
indicating
that
any
uses
of
private
information
will
be
acceptable
if
people
perceive
such
information
is
used
against
them
as
in
differential
pricing
which
typically
elicits
strongly
negative
reactions
they
are
likely
to
call
on
government
to
fix
the
problem
the
general
conclusion
is
that
some
form
of
government
intervention
to
set
the
rules
is
inevitable
and
at
some
point
it
may
be
welcomed
by
the
players
just
as
government
intervention
was
welcomed
in
the
end
by
the
railroads
society
needs
basic
rules
to
operate
by
and
modern
technology
creates
potential
scenarios
that
old
rules
did
not
cover
but
we
need
to
remember
also
that
it
is
not
easy
to
regulate
markets
especially
ones
in
cyberspace
and
especially
when
policy
makers
labor
under
the
burden
of
many
false
myths
as
was
mentioned
before
railroads
initially
were
subject
to
structural
separation
but
governments
found
it
impossible
to
enforce
this
see
jackman
1916
chapter
for
more
information
about
the
transition
of
british
railways
to
become
carriers
instead
of
just
providers
of
rail
roads
and
we
have
more
modern
evidence
of
the
need
for
clear
interfaces
in
telecommunications
for
effective
regulation
faulhaber
2003
it
appears
very
difficult
to
regulate
packet
data
network
like
the
internet
which
depends
for
its
basic
justification
on
statistical
multiplexing
as
has
been
pointed
out
before
the
internet
has
not
been
net
neutral
in
the
past
and
it
is
not
one
now
the
question
of
how
one
deals
with
legitimate
network
management
issues
as
well
as
with
services
that
appear
to
reside
most
naturally
in
the
network
is
thorny
one
extending
with
appropriate
modifications
traditional
regulatory
approaches
to
the
internet
as
proposed
for
example
in
weiser
2008
may
very
well
be
the
eventual
outcome
but
it
would
not
be
easy
and
will
continue
to
provide
lifetime
employment
to
legions
of
lawyers
and
economists
it
would
be
far
easier
to
enforce
neutrality
rules
on
network
that
provided
dark
fiber
or
wavelengths
only
which
would
be
sold
to
service
providers
who
would
then
provide
higher
level
services
that
of
course
would
require
complete
restructuring
of
the
industry
it
might
be
wise
both
for
society
and
for
shareholders
of
those
companies
but
very
hard
to
achieve
while
technology
imposes
constraints
on
how
effective
regulation
can
be
it
also
imposes
constraints
on
what
service
providers
can
do
especially
when
the
most
valued
services
such
as
voice
texting
and
even
simple
search
are
low
bandwidth
it
is
hard
for

service
providers
to
effectively
regulate
traffic
and
thereby
extract
value
at
least
without
very
intrusive
measures
which
would
likely
be
resented
and
could
lead
to
protests
and
government
intervention
the
strategy
of
controlling
just
streaming
video
traffic
is
very
unlikely
to
be
productive
financial
markets
and
the
future
of
net
neutrality
the
importance
of
price
discrimination
in
enabling
deployment
of
infrastructure
industries
has
been
recognized
by
policy
makers
for
long
time
not
only
was
it
enshrined
in
the
toll
schedules
of
railroads
canals
and
turnpikes
but
there
are
historical
examples
where
an
increased
level
of
discrimination
was
allowed
in
order
to
save
floundering
enterprise
odlyzko
2004a
cites
the
beverley
beck
navigation
in
the
18th
century
in
which
the
initial
already
discriminatory
toll
schedule
was
modified
by
the
british
parliament
to
allow
for
greater
differential
in
charges
for
different
goods
this
was
not
an
isolated
case
in
1845
in
order
to
fortify
canals
in
their
losing
struggle
with
the
rapidly
expanding
railway
industry
parliament
passed
law
explicitly
authorizing
canals
to
be
their
own
carriers
something
only
few
had
been
permitted
to
be
in
the
past
and
giving
them
some
leeway
to
vary
their
tolls
jackman
1916
chapter
this
attempt
to
keep
the
canals
as
viable
competitors
to
railways
did
not
succeed
and
as
the
suez
canal
was
opening
when
its
financial
prospects
looked
bleak
the
economist
of
nov
20
1869
suggested
that
suez
tolls
should
be
changed
from
the
simple
fixed
fee
per
ton
of
cargo
ship
capacity
and
per
passenger
to
ones
that
depended
on
the
value
of
cargo
this
advice
was
not
followed
thus
there
are
precedents
for
telecom
companies
to
ask
for
ability
to
charge
special
fees
to
companies
like
google
that
might
be
deriving
large
profits
from
the
use
of
the
infrastructure
the
question
is
do
they
need
it
and
there
is
little
evidence
that
they
do
extensive
price
discrimination

tolerated
on

even
under

however
railroads
were

faced
with
demands
for
further
expansion

their
revenues
were

telecommunications
in
the
is
at
about
depending
on
what
is
counted
back
in
1907
it
was
around
1.2
if
we
count
postal
services
telegraph
and
telephone
and
the
post
office
accounted
for
more
than
half
of
that
total
odlyzko
2000
furthermore
railroads
were
struggling
with
rising
costs
as
the
demand
for
local
transport
grew
and
rail
technology
was
not
suited
to
satisfy
it
telecommunications
today
is
in
different
environment
with
most
costs
in
steep
decline
this
is
only
partly
due
to
the
internet
already
almost
decade
ago
it
was
estimated
that
the
entire
plant
of
the
phone
companies
which
had
cost
about
340
billion
could
be
duplicated
for
about
180
billion
or
roughly
half
stuck
and
weingarten
2002
further
technological
advances
have
taken
place
since
then
so
current
costs
would
likely
be
lower
even
in
nominal
dollars
this
evolution
has
been
partially
hidden
by
the
rise
of
spending
on
wireless
which
has
kept
total
costs
revenues
and
profits
high
basically
of
the
three
main
segments
of
traditional
telephony
access
switching
and
long
distance
which
ages
ago
were
regarded
as
about
equally
expensive
the
second
and
third
have
shrunk
dramatically
and
the
access
piece
dominates
for
discussion
of
how
inexpensive
the
backbones
of
the
internet
are
see
odlyzko
2003b
and
for
evidence
that
those
infamous
exafloods
are
not
swamping

that
is
why
capital
expenditure
capex
of
the
telcos
has
been
weak
as
their
replacement
cost
has
been
consistently
lower
than
their
depreciation
charges
and
that
is
what
has
helped
produce
the
bountiful
free
cash
flow
and
profits
of
recent
years
further
evidence
that
telcos
do
not
need
vast
new
revenues
to
be
able
to
afford
buildout
of
broadband
networks
comes
from
international
comparisons
in
many
other
countries
far
faster
networks
are
available
at
lower
prices
even
if
one
makes
allowances
for
differentials
in
labor
costs
taxes
and
the
like
it
seems
that
broadband
networks
are
all
that
expensive
to
build
there
certainly
are
some
widely
publicized
claims
that
huge
increases
in
investment
are
needed
to
provide
widespread
broadband
connectivity
probably
the
most
extreme
one
is
study
from
at
clarke
2007
which
claims
that
what
it
calls
fully
unmanaged
ip
networks
would
require
between
143
and
416
per
month
per
connection
the
detailed
cost
estimates
in
the
appendix
to
clarke
2007
are
questionable
as
dave
burstein
has
pointed
out
in
private
communication
if
they
were
correct
at
u-verse
service
would
be
ruinously
expensive
to
provide
contradicting
what
at
has
been
telling
its
investors
but
even
if
they
were
correct
they
would
be
almost
irrelevant
the
basic
assumption
of
clarke
2007
is
that
the
fully
unmanaged
ip
networks
would
need
to
be
built
today
with
today
technology
and
at
today
prices
and
would
need
to
accommodate
essentially
all
foreseeable
demands
today
in
particular
they
would
need
to
provide
for
transmission
of
all
the
video
consumed
today
but
at
higher
resolution
all
over
the
basic
internet
access
link
but
in
practice
internet
usage
is
not
changing
all
that
rapidly
recent

to

the

that

that

is
unlikely
to
disastrously
overflow
the

at

an
increasing
extent
paid
for
by
flat
fees
those
same
flat
fees
that
the
telecom
industry
has
disdained
and
misunderstood
for
over
century
some
more
evidence
comes
from
the
costs
of
the
electric
distribution
system
and
others
in
particular
the
electric
system
reaches
out
further
than
the
wireline
phone
system
yet
is
operated
at
fraction
of
the
cost
of
the
latter
and
in
very
neutral
fashion
now
of
course
electricity
distribution
does
not
have
the
switching
costs
of
the
telecom
network
but
it
is
those
switching
costs
that
are
plummeting
as
moore
laws
continue
operating
what
remains
relatively
expensive
is
just
the
cost
of
getting
the
physical
conduit
to
the
consumer
the
current
campaign
to
justify
high
revenues
and
differential
pricing
on
the
internet
is
reminiscent
of
the
campaign
in
the
late
1990s
by
telcos
to
charge
special
fees
on
dial
internet
access
the
argument
then
was
that
the
long
holding
times
on
internet
access
calls
made
with
modems
were
wreaking
havoc
with
the
carefully
planned
telco
equipment
and
were
making
flat
rate
pricing
unviable
had
regulators
in
the
listened
to
such
pleadings
the
growth
of
the
internet
would
undoubtedly
been
greatly
impeded
however
they
instead
turned
deaf
ear
and
allowed
flat
rate
to
continue
to
apply
for
modem
calls
to
the
internet
the
result
was
boom
in
profits
for
the
telcos
in
the
first
place
their
complaints
about
increased
traffic
were
very
suspect
since
that
traffic
was
achieved
largely
through
customers
leasing
extra
lines
just
for
internet
access
as
is
seen
in
table
on
36
of
odlyzko
1998
although
it
should
be
mentioned
that
later
in
the
1990s
beyond
the
1996
figure
that
was
the
most
current
at
the
time
of
writing
of
that
report
average
total
length
of
calls
per
line
did
go
up
somewhat
further
internet
access
was
concentrated
later
in
the
day
or
night
to
be
precise
than
voice
calls
so
did
not
interfere
as
much
as
claimed
with
basic
traffic
and
finally
costs
of
switching
equipment
declined
rapidly
during
that
period
and
so
none
of
the
predicted
disasters
materialized
and
the
industry
thrived
thus
to
correctly
evaluate
claims
about
need
for
additional
revenues
for
broadband
networks
one
needs
solid
cost
data
and
dynamic
model
of
the
industry
at
the
moment
we
do
not
have
either
one
available
we
should
also
remember
that
even
with
net
neutrality
rules
in
place
service
providers
would
still
be
able
to
segment
the
market
by
speed
of
connections
since
the
main
value
of
data
networks
resides
in
provision
of
low
transaction
latency
odlyzko
1999
not
of
capacity
for
streaming
video
at
modest
rates
this
might
very
well
be
sufficient
to
differentiate
among
users
and
yet
still
preserve
the
flat
rate
pricing
those
customers
insist
on
while
the
telcos
probably
do
not
need
to
engage
in
differential
pricing
to
pay
for
broadband
networks
they
may
very
well
need
such
pricing
to
support
their
stock
prices
but
that
is
where
we
get
into
the
great
puzzle
of
the
current
financial
markets
returns
on
invested
capital
are
very
high
generally
over
15
per
year
historical
record
and
they
have
been
that
high
for
several
years
and
they
have
been
that
high
worldwide
this
has
been
explained
as
result
of
the
entry
of
many
developing
countries
especially
china
and
india
into
the
world
economy
this
essentially
doubled
the
world
labor
force
while
the
stock
of
capital
goods
increased
only
little
in
this
view
high
equity
returns
are
simply
the
outcome
of
changed
capital
to
labor
ratio
with
more
going
to
pay
for
scarce
capital
than
for
abundant
labor
this
is
reasonable
argument
but
it
does
not
explain
why
longterm
interest
rates
were
as
low
as
they
were
for
long
time
on
the
order
of
for
high
grade
corporate
bonds
through
early
2008
the
contrast
between
and
15
is
striking
after
all
equity
and
bonds
are
just
two
forms
of
finance
and
while
equity
has
traditionally
55
review
of
network
economics
vol
issue
march
2009
earned
more
than
bonds
it
is
hard
to
explain
gap
this
wide
why
doesn
someone
borrow
at
the
low
interest
rates
and
compete
away
those
abnormally
high
equity
returns
the
big
borrowing
binge
by
hedge
funds
and
private
equity
funds
was
largely
for
financial
investments
not
for
new
brick
and
mortar
facilities
nor
for
software
development
that
was
the
big
puzzle
the
current
late
2008
and
early
2009
financial
crisis
may
be
eliminate
this
puzzle
another
anomaly
of
the
financial
markets
of
the
last
few
years
was
the
unusually
high
fraction
of
corporate
profits
that
were
coming
from
the
financial
sector
but
the
huge
writedowns
by
financial
institutions
in
late
2007
and
2008
including
several
bankruptcies
and
wide
government
interventions
show
that
to
large
extent
those
profits
were
delusion
caused
by
defective
accounting
for
value
and
risk
one
possible
outcome
of
the
financial
crash
might
paradoxically
be
that
it
will
encourage
greater
investment
in
telecommunications
infrastructure
even
aside
from
government
funding
for
economic
stimulus
the
crash
might
after
main
turbulence
subsides
lead
to
more
realistic
expectations
of
investment
returns
which
will
make
longterm
investments
in
projects
such
as
fiber
to
the
home
more
attractive
however
the
great
puzzle
of
the
financial
markets
is
resolved
cable
companies
and
telcos
definitely
contributed
to
it
as
is
described
in
odlyzko
2003b
their
valuations
before
the
crash
of
2008
were
considerably
above
their
replacement
cost
this
was
also
true
for
most
of
other
industries
result
of
those
abnormally
high
equity
returns
as
rough
approximation
it
appeared
that
the
valuations
of
both
the
cable
and
the
telco
sides
assumed
that
they
would
get
the
entire
telecommunications
spending
of
the
economy
that
might
be
true
for
one
or
the
other
but
not
for
both
at
least
not
unless
they
could
somehow
induce
huge
new
increases
in
those
expenditures
possibly
by
exploiting
the
potential
of
discriminatory
pricing
policy
makers
in
the
have
limited
tools
with
which
to
induce
deployment
of
broadband
networks
but
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
imposing
some
sort
of
net
neutrality
would
impede
that
policy
goal
as
the
current
rate
of
deployment
seems
gated
by
other
considerations
some
form
of
net
neutrality
mandate
hard
as
it
would
be
to
define
and
enforce
might
be
more
appropriate
in
order
to
promote
the
development
of
the
applications
that
will
provide
value
to
users
and
make
them
willing
to
spend
on
dumb
pipe
broadband
which
might
be
much
more
effective
in
stimulating
investment
by
current
players
left
to
themselves
current
operators
would
surely
concentrate
on
building
out
systems
optimized
for
content
delivery
yet
as
has
been
easy
to
predict
from
historical
precedents
odlyzko
2000
and
odlyzko
2001a
the
most
promising
avenues
for
stimulating
interest
in
broadband
by
users
is
by
promoting
social
interactivity
in
that
sense
success
of
services
like
youtube
and
facebook
was
very
natural
and
predictable
yet
it
caught
the
industry
by
surprise
thus
simply
providing
more
funding
for
current
operators
is
likely
to
be
wasteful
in
that
it
would
either
be
pocketed
as
extra
profit
or
spent
in
wasteful
ways
the
one
thing
that
has
been
well
documented
see
for
example
odlyzko
2004b
is
that
established
service
providers
are
terrible
at
innovation
in
services
their
core
expertise
is
in
widespread
delivery
of
basic
connectivity
and
they
and
their
suppliers
have
done
well
in
innovating
there
introducing
dsl
cable
modems
wireless
transmission
technologies
dwdm
and
so
on
but
they
have
failed
utterly
in
end-user
services
the
great
success
story
to
date
in
wireless
data
is
texting
which
was
an
accidental
by-product
of
the
gsm
technology
development
not
meant
for
consumer
use
even
the
one
shining
example
of
successful
content
service
ring
tone
downloads
came
as
surprise
at
the
2004
ofc
conference
where
pointed
this
out
in
presentation
one
56
review
of
network
economics
vol
issue
march
2009
of
the
later
speakers
prominent
telco
executive
was
clearly
offended
and
responded
with
declaration
that
the
industry
was
very
innovative
but
the
only
example
he
could
cite
was
caller
id
structural
separation
or
strict
net
neutrality
regime
could
be
beneficial
for
shareholders
of
the
service
provider
companies
as
it
would
enable
those
enterprises
to
concentrate
on
their
core
expertise
which
is
to
provide
basic
connectivity
those
much
derided
dumb
pipes
commodity
services
do
not
have
to
be
unprofitable
after
all
and
recent
moves
in
particular
the
2007
iphone
deal
that
at
concluded
with
apple
may
reflect
the
growing
realization
that
the
main
sources
of
innovation
in
services
are
and
will
continue
to
come
from
outside
and
with
greater
innovation
one
can
expect
greater
growth
in
demand
for
the
basic
transmission
capacity
just
as
flat
rate
internet
access
stimulated
demand
for
basic
voice
lines
in
the
late
1990s
and
led
to
increased
profits
for
telcos
even
though
they
did
not
contribute
whit
to
anything
on
the
internet
itself
but
the
vertical
integration
case
will
surely
continue
to
be
pursued
because
of
its
revenue
and
profit
attractions
and
note
that
the
cloud
computing
idea
is
actually
an
extreme
form
of
vertical
integration
just
carried
out
by
other
companies
than
the
telecom
service
providers
and
at
higher
levels
of
the
protocol
stack
there
are
attractions
to
end-users
in
some
levels
of
vertical
integration
the
concept
of
do-it-yourself
end-to-end
network
is
attractive
but
few
users
have
the
skills
and
patience
to
make
it
reality
so
we
will
likely
see
extensive
vertical
integration
the
only
question
is
where
and
what
dangers
will
it
produce
the
basic
conclusion
is
that
for
pervasive
infrastructure
services
that
are
crucial
for
the
functioning
of
society
rules
about
allowable
degrees
of
discrimination
have
traditionally
applied
and
are
likely
to
be
demanded
for
the
internet
in
the
future
those
rules
have
often
been
set
by
governments
and
are
likely
to
be
set
by
them
in
the
future
as
well
for
telecommunications
given
current
trends
in
demand
and
in
rate
and
sources
of
innovation
it
appears
to
be
better
for
society
not
to
tilt
towards
the
operators
and
instead
to
stimulate
innovation
on
the
network
by
others
by
enforcing
net
neutrality
but
this
would
likely
open
the
way
for
other
players
such
as
google
that
emerge
from
that
open
and
competitive
