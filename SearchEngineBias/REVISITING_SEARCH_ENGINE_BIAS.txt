INTRODUCTION

Questions about search engine bias have percolated in the
academic literature for over a decade. In the past few years, the
issue has evolved from a quiet academic debate to a full blown
regulatory and litigation frenzy. At the center of this maelstrom is
Google, the dominant market player.
This Essay looks at changes in the industry and political
environment over the past half-dozen years that have contributed

to the current situation, and supplements my prior contribution to

of Search Engine Utopianism.
II. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST HALF-DOZEN YEARS
This section highlights four major developments to the search
engine industry over the past half-dozen years:
(1) Google has dominated the search engine industry but faces
emerging competition from entities that are not traditional
search engines.
(2) Google has changed its search results pages substantially.
(3) Google has expanded its proprietary service offerings, which it
promotes on its search results pages.
(4) The emergence of Net Neutrality as a policy issue has spurred
consideration of a “Search Neutrality” analogue.
A. Google Rolled Up the Keyword Search Market but Faces Other New
Competitors
In the past half-dozen years, Google has largely rolled up the
U.S. keyword search industry—both organic search as well as
keyword advertising. Google now has a dominant position in both
markets. In 2006, it was clear that Google would thrive, but it was
less clear that no major new competitors would successfully
challenge Google’s dominance in the high-margin multi-billion
dollar industry.
At the time, the industry had four major search engines—
3
Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Ask —and several promising startup efforts. Since then, Ask (a perennial also-ran) stopped
4
maintaining a search index, and Yahoo stopped generating its own
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/technology/14google.html. The United
States and EU differ in a number of important respects, including Google’s
market share (in some EU countries, Google has over ninety percent market
share), Europe’s comparatively pro-regulatory approach, and the United States’
regulatory restrictions, such as the Constitution and the Communications Decency
Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 230 (2010). Due to these differences, search engine
developments in Europe may not provide good insights into U.S. policy.

although Yahoo still retains control over the results presentation.
Other new entrants have emerged from time to time, but none of
them have garnered a meaningful audience.
Given these developments, effectively, the organic search

Microsoft—and Google dominates the field.

It remains unclear why the organic search industry has
consolidated so much or what is the socially optimal number of
competitors. Possibilities include:
• Running an industry-competitive search engine is really
expensive. Yahoo expected to save $200 million a year by
10
outsourcing its search operations to Microsoft.
• Search indexes may have economies of scale. In justifying its
deal with Yahoo, Microsoft argued that having higher volumes

competitive threats we did not anticipate in 2006. For example,
both Facebook and Twitter have emerged as partial alternatives to
Google keyword searching.
Twitter does a huge volume of searches on its real-time
16
database. Indeed, recognizing Twitter’s success at addressing realtime informational needs, for several years, Google licensed
17
Twitter’s real-time content and made Twitter results more
18
prominent on Google’s search results pages.
Facebook does not directly compete with Google for keyword
searches, but Facebook has emerged as a crucial competitor
nonetheless. First, Facebook competes with Google for user
19
mindshare. As Facebook captures more user time and attention,
these users will utilize Google less. Further, as users experiment
with finding information through their social network, Google’s
20
keyword searching may become a less important resource.

The emergence of Twitter and Facebook as possible substitutes
for Google search demonstrates two key points about Internet
competition generally. First, if we evaluate Internet competition
only by taking a point-in-time snapshot of existing competitors, we
will probably fail to anticipate the identity and business proposition
of disruptive new entrants. Second, in a digital environment with
low switching costs between vendors, consumers will flock to new
entrants that solve their informational needs—even if the
competitors offer a very different solution. As a result, a dominant
information provider in one technological niche still faces
significant cross-elasticity of demand from providers in other
technological niches.
With respect to search engine bias, a dominant search engine
is potentially disconcerting. I previously argued that consumers
21
would migrate to or from search engines based on relevancy; but
if consumers do not have meaningful choices, search engine bias
could create serious issues for online information credibility and
accessibility. At the same time, the past half-dozen years have
shown that competition from indirect competitors (who serve
consumers’ informational needs, even if they use different
methodologies) can and do keep problematic search engine bias in
check by creating meaningful alternatives for consumers.
Because Google has emerged as the dominant search engine,
much of the “search engine bias” discussion has merged with a
critique of Google’s biased practices. We will revisit this merging
later; but for now, this Essay focuses on Google’s practices because
they are often considered coextensive with the search engine
22
industry.

[Vol. 38:1

B. Google’s Search Results Page Has Gotten More Complicated
In 2006, most Google search results pages had two primary
23
zones: organic search results and keyword ads. Because the first
24
search result page gets the vast majority of clicks, in practice,
everyone was trying to squeeze into a very limited space: the top ten
organic search results (of which only the top few really matter
traffic-wise) and a small number of advertising spots.
Google’s ad spots on search results pages have not materially
25
changed, but the organic search results have become much more
complicated. Instead of a single set of ten organic results, Google
now often shows numerous “zones” of search results on a single
search results page. These include traditional organic search
results, local results, news results, shopping results, video results,
highlighted brands, results from sites in the searcher’s social
26
network, a map for geographic results, and more.
Marketers now seek to show up favorably in each subzone. For
example, if the local results zone appears after the third organic
result, the first local result might generate more traffic than the
fourth organic search result. Consequently, being the first organic
search result remains commercially valuable, but it is no longer as
crucial as it used to be. In effect, Google’s search results now
create multiple tournaments with multiple winners, thus
supplanting the single winner-take-all tournament that prevailed in
2006. The proliferation of results zones increases the number of
zones where search results bias might occur, but bias within each
zone may be less crucial than in the past.

23. Cf. Greg Lastowka, Google’s Law, 73 BROOK. L. REV. 1327, 1342 (2008)
(discussing the left and right columns, representing organic results and keyword
ads, respectively).
24. See Goldman, supra note 2.
25. Their positioning has not materially changed, and Google has made
various small refinements in their presentation. Perhaps the biggest change is that
Google stopped using the term “sponsored links” and now calls the ads “ads.” E.g.,

26. This is part of Google’s “universal search” initiative. See Google Begins Move

C. Google’s Portalization

103

27

For the first several years of Google’s existence, Google sought
28
to move users off its site to third-party sites as quickly as possible.
Google’s stated goal was to figure out what consumers wanted and
29
get them to their desired destination fast.
The “I’m Feeling Lucky” button (still on Google’s home page)
exemplified this philosophy. Google says, “[a]n ‘I’m Feeling
TM
Lucky ’ search means you spend less time searching for web pages
30
and more time looking at them” —even if getting searchers off the
31
site quickly costs Google money.
Over the past half-dozen years, Google’s priorities have
changed in two ways. First, Google now attempts to answer many
types of queries—including weather predictions, flight tracking,
currency conversion, package tracking, stock quotes, sports scores,
32
movie times, and health information —directly on the search
results page above other organic results, without the searcher
needing to click on any search results or go to any third-party
websites. As a result, where Google used to send searchers to thirdparty websites for these factual queries, Google increasingly keeps
33
the searchers on Google’s own pages. This implicitly puts Google
in competition with third-party websites that would derive

Not surprisingly, some third-party websites are unhappy that
Google shows so much indexed information on its own pages.

public brawl between Google and the websites it indexes. The

REVISITING SEARCH ENGINE BIAS

search engine bias (i.e., neutrality implies a lack of bias). Because
so much attention has been paid to net neutrality, the analogous
term “search neutrality” has eclipsed “search engine bias” as the
appellation of choice.
The vernacular shift from “search engine bias” to “search
neutrality” creates three interrelated problems. First, it invites an
apples-to-oranges comparison between net neutrality and search
neutrality, even though they address different issues.
Second, given that no one can agree on net neutrality’s
definition, importing its semantic ambiguity into the search engine
bias debate hardly improves the discourse.
Third, the term “search neutrality” implies the existence of
neutral search engines, but those are entirely mythical. Every
search engine design choice necessarily and unavoidably reflects

Thus, the term “search neutrality” implies a

Platonic ideal of a search engine that cannot be achieved.
Naturally, then, Google’s practices fail to conform to this Platonic
54
ideal, but so does every other search engine in the real world.
III. THE END OF RATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT SEARCH ENGINE BIAS
Google’s dominance of the search engine industry distorts the
discussion about search engine bias in other unfortunate ways.
55
Google has made a lot of enemies on its way to the top, and many
of them are willing to use legal tools to degrade Google’s
competitive position. Some of the anti-Google forces are advancing
positions that may help tweak Google in the short term, but could
ironically conflict with their long-term interests.

WILLIAM MITCHELL LAW REVIEW

[Vol. 38:1

Microsoft—who learned a lot about antitrust law from its
decade-long antitrust defense—has actively marshaled forces
against Google, including spurring efforts to increase the

regulation of search engines. Should those efforts succeed,
Microsoft’s own search engine, Bing, ought to be subject to
the regulations as well. Thus, Microsoft-instigated regulatory
intervention could ultimately hamper Bing’s freedom to

many newspapers have been local monopolists with zero
63
accountability for any abuse of their editorial position. It is
shamefully hypocritical for newspapers—historically the
strongest champion of publishers’ editorial freedom—to
advocate against Google’s editorial freedom because the
newspapers distrust how Google uses it.
As these examples indicate, truly “neutral” perspectives about
search engine bias are increasingly rare. Instead, competitive
jostling has overtaken much of the discussion. Given the huge
economic stakes associated with the search engine industry, it has
become almost impossible to distinguish legitimate discourse from
economic rent-seeking.
Amazingly, despite all of this competitive gunning for Google,
there is still no strong evidence (or, in my opinion, persuasive
evidence) that (1) Google has used illegitimate practices to
advance or maintain its industry dominance, or (2) consumers
cannot or will not gravitate to the most effective online search tools
available to them. Without such evidence, it remains equally
plausible that the search engine marketplace continues to function
well, and searchers continue to vote with their mice. It just so
happens that many of those votes are for Google.
In the rare recent discussions about search engine bias not
driven by economic gamesmanship, the discussion often considers
whether regulators (or plaintiffs) can “improve” search engine
results compared to the results search engines produce guided by
