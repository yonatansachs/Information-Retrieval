ABSTRACT

rience [11]. Physical attractiveness is a pervasive and
powerful agent in the social world, that is also being
affected by social algorithms and by the growing digitization of the physical world. Physical attractiveness has
influence on decisions, opportunities and perceptions of
ourselves and others. So, one natural question arises:
what is the impact of search engines on the perception
of physical attractiveness? Our previous work on search
results identified stereotypes for female attractiveness in
images available in the Web[2].
Stereotypes can be regarded as “pictures in our head
that portray all members of a group as having the same
attribute” [4]. They are generally defined as beliefs
about the characteristics, attributes, and behaviors of
members of certain groups [7]. As pointed out in [4],
humans think with the aid of categories and categories
are the basis for normal prejudgment. In many circumstances, categories turn into stereotypes, such as
Africans have rhythm or Asians are good at math. Stereotypes may also be associated with some prejudgment,
that indicates some sort of social bias, positive or negative. Age, race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation are elements that contribute to the creation of
stereotypes in different cultures.
Stereotypes can evolve in ways that are linked to social and cultural changes. Some stereotypes and prejudgment found in the material world are transferred
to the online world. For example, [9] identified gender
stereotypes in image search results for occupation. Considering the internet is blurring the lines between local
and global cultures, a relevant question is to understand
the impact of local and global factors on the formation
of stereotypes in the internet. The mechanism of repetition (e.g., repetition of music, videos, images, etc.)
is one step that characterizes the influence of globalization on local cultures. This work aims at understanding
the role of local and global factors on the formation of

The internet has been blurring the lines between local and
global cultures, affecting in different ways the perception
of people about themselves and others. In the global context of the internet, search engine platforms are a key mediator between individuals and information. In this paper,
we examine the local and global impact of the internet on
the formation of female physical attractiveness stereotypes
in search engine results. By investigating datasets of images
collected from two major search engines in 42 countries, we
identify a significant fraction of replicated images. We find
that common images are clustered around countries with the
same language. We also show that existence of common
images among countries is practically eliminated when the
queries are limited to local sites. In summary, we show evidence that results from search engines are biased towards
the language used to query the system, which leads to certain attractiveness stereotypes that are often quite different
from the majority of the female population of the country.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

All over the world, search engines are powerful mediators between individuals and the access to information
and knowledge. General search engines play a major
role when it comes to give visibility to cultural, social
and economic aspects of the daily life [1]. Recent studies
have demonstrated that the ranking of answers provided
by search engines have a strong impact on individuals
attitudes, preference and behavior [6]. Usually, people
trust the answers in higher ranks, without having any
idea how the answers get ranked by complex and opaque
algorithms [12].
Search engines can be viewed as part of a broad class
of social algorithms, that are used to size us up, evaluate what we want, and provide a customized expe∗Computer

stereotypes found in search engine results for physical
attractiveness.
In order to understand the local and global impact
of internet on stereotypes, we focus on the analysis of
answers provided by search engines in different countries to questions associated with physical attractiveness. The complexity of internet search platforms, such
as Google and Bing, makes it impossible to look for
transparency of their algorithms and data. So, our
approach for the stereotype problem is to follow the
concept of transparency of inputs and outputs (aka as
black-box techniques) of a class of specific queries [5].
This type of approach has been successfully used to
analyze the behavior of complex systems, such as virtual machines [16]. Black-box techniques infer information about the behavior of systems by simply observing
each virtual machine from the outside and without any
knowledge of the application resident within each machine. Several interesting observations related to bias
and fairness were learned from the quantitative analysis
of the global and local answers provided by the search
engines to our set of input queries on female physical
attractiveness.

culture on the formation of stereotypes through two factors: language and location. The starting point of our
analysis is a set of image queries, defined by the context
of interest (in our case attractiveness stereotypes) submitted to different search engines. We then analyze, for
each query, the top 100 images checking which images
do repeat across queries as well as image characteristics (e.g., race) and try to draw patterns that arise for
languages and countries. In particular, since the same
language may be spoken in several countries, we employ
a two-level strategy, where we first check for patterns
at the language granularity and then we also consider
location as well.
In the following sections, we first describe the data
gathering strategy, then the procedure to generate image fingerprints that will allow to detect the occurrence
of the same image in several queries and finally the similarity metric used to compare query results.

Data Gathering

Data gathering was carried through two search engine
APIs for images: Google1 and Bing2 . Once gathered,
we extract features from the images using Face++3 . In

several countries, providing a good coverage in terms of
regions and internet usage, and their official languages:

Austria, Germany, Greece, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, USA, South Africa, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Finland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Portugal, Russia,

This section describes the experiments carried out
in our analysis and present the main results. First,
we present evidence that images co-occur in different
datasets. Then, we characterize the repetition of images across search results by analyzing the similarities
between them. Finally, we compare global and local results, analyzing them in terms of similarity and racial
profile of the target countries.

3.2

4.1

Image Fingerprinting

In order to identify the co-occurrence of images across
datasets, we need a method that is able to identify
whether two images are the same or not. Matching
their URLs is not good enough, since the same image
may be provided by different sites. Also, using a hash
function such as MD5 or SHA-1 does not solve the problem either, since a re-sized image would be associated
with a completely different hash value compared to the
original one.
Ideally, the technique should be able to “fingerprint”
an image, i.e., to determine a label that uniquely identifies the image, despite small modifications. We use
the dHash (difference hash) algorithm [10], which consists of four main steps: (1) it shrinks the image to 9x8
pixels; (2) it converts the image to grayscale; (3) it computes the difference between adjacent pixels; and (4) it
assigns bits whenever the left pixel is brighter than the
right pixel. This algorithm will output a 64-bit hash
value per image that we use to uniquely identify the
images in our datasets.

3.3

Repetition of Images

In order to analyze the repetition of images across
our search results, we start by calculating the dHash of
each image and determine the frequency of each unique
hash value in our datasets. Our goal is to analyze how
frequently the same images appear in multiple queries,
countries and services. For this experiment we use only
the global dataset.
Figure 1 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function
(CDF) of the number of repeated images, for three scenarios: whole dataset (left), grouping by query (center)
and grouping by service (right). First, we observe that
there are, indeed, images that do appear in several sets
of results. Although 71% of the images are unique,
some images appear in up to 33 different sets of results.
Another interesting finding is that images resulting
for the query “ugly woman” seem to repeat more often than the other queries. For instance, the maximum
value of repetition for “ugly woman” is 32, whereas for
“beautiful woman” is 13 and for “woman” is 14.
Comparing the distribution between services, we observe that they are slightly different. In Bing results,
68% of the images are unique, while in Google it is
76%. These results motivate us to investigate what the
factors that influence image repetition are.

Similarity Metric

An adequate comparison of sets of images returned
by a query requires a similarity metric. Given two lists
of images, A and B, the Jaccard index measures the
similarity (or diversity) between A and B, and is cal|A∩B|
. In other words, it is the
culated as J(A, B) = |A∪B|
ratio between the size of the intersection and the size
of the union of A and B. The closer the index is to 0,

Now we aim to investigate the reasons for the cooccurrence of images. We measure similarity between
services, queries and countries. For the analysis pre3

Figure 2: Similarity of image results between countries, for the query “beautiful woman” in Google
sented in this section just the global dataset is used.

4.2.3

4.2.1

Finally, we compare the lists between each pair of
countries (861 for Google and 231 for Bing), and calculate their Jaccard index. Due to space limitations,
we present here only the results for the query “beautiful woman” in Google, but the results are similar for
the other datasets and queries. Figure 2 (left) shows
the similarity matrix between countries. To enhance
visibility, we present only the 22 countries that cluster
with other countries.
In contrast to the service and query analyses, there
are very strong similarities between countries. We observe that the similarities are stronger among countries
that speak the same language, and almost nonexistent
between countries that speak different languages. The
influence of language is so pronounced that we may easily identify “language-based clusters”.
Such result is explained by the fact that images are
indexed by the search engine using the content of the
web-page with which the image is associated. Since the
queries are issued using written natural language, it is
possible that an image returned, for example, by Google
Mexico is actually from a site in Spain (e.g., xyz.es)

Services

In this experiment we analyze the co-occurrence of
images in both Bing and Google. We do that by comparing the pairs of image sets (one from Bing and one
from Google) for the same query and same country. In
this case, there are 22 pairs of services for each query,
totaling 66 pairs.
The average Jaccard indices for plain, beautiful and
ugly woman queries are, respectively, 0.04, 0.06 and
0.11, indicating that there is no significant match between results from Bing and Google. Despite that, the
similarity for “ugly woman” is almost twice as large as
the others (on average), supporting our previous finding
that “ugly woman” images repeat more often.

4.2.2

Queries

Analogously to the comparison between services, we
will now analyze the co-occurrence of images between
queries (e.g "woman" vs. "beautiful woman"). For
this scenario we have three possible pairs: "woman"
vs. "beautiful woman", "woman" vs. "ugly woman"
and "beautiful woman" vs. "ugly woman". Since we
compare within each service and country, we analyze
64 pairs (22 + 42) for each combination of queries, totaling 192 pairs.
We observe that, again, the similarity is small. The
average Jaccard index for “ugly woman” compared to
either “woman” or “beautiful woman” is 0.01 (std =
0.02). Interestingly, the similarity between “woman”
and “beautiful woman” is three times larger than the
other combinations (avg = 0.03, std = 0.03), indicating that the plain query (“woman”) tends to give results
closer to “beautiful woman”. It is important to notice
that this is a preliminary result, since the standard deviation values are high and the confidence intervals overlap with the average values of the other.

4.3

Countries

Global and Local Images

As shown in the previous section, there are very strong
similarities between countries. Our hypothesis is that
the results of image searches, on both search engine
platforms, are biased in relation to language and do not
always reflect the characteristics of the female population of the country.
We investigate the effect of filtering the search query
to return only results from a given country, defined by
local sites existing in the country code domain of the
specific country. For this investigation we select the
countries of the two largest clusters (English and Spanish), totaling 8 countries in Bing and 15 in Google. We
then collect the images using the same methodology
used for searching globally (without the country filter).

searches in Argentina and Australia, where 97% 6 and
92% 5 ) of the population is white, respectively.

Similarity

We initially assess the impact on the similarity between countries when searching images locally. Similarly to Section 4.2.3, we calculate the Jaccard index
for each pair of countries.
Figure 2 (right) shows the similarity matrix for the
local search results. Compared to the matrix for global
queries (left), it is visible how the similarity is drastically reduced. The clusters have virtually disappeared,
despite some small values (< 0.1) remained for the
Spanish cluster (Mexico and Spain) and the English
cluster (Australia, Canada and United Kingdom).
This result supports our observation that the similarity is almost non-existent between countries that speak
different languages. On the other hand, we may easily
identify “language-based clusters”.

Racial Profile

In our previous work [2], we have demonstrated the
existence of stereotypes for female physical attractiveness, in particular negative stereotypes about black women
and positive stereotypes about white women in terms of
physical attractiveness. In this work we show how the
racial profile of the countries changes when we filter local results, indicating that query results do not reflect
the local demography. We then compare the racial distribution of a country when issuing global queries vs.
local queries.
It is possible to observe how the racial distribution
changes for almost every country/query when the search
query is local (Figure 3). For African countries (Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia) the proportion of black
women increases for almost all queries - only for ’ugly
woman’, on Bing, the proportion decreases for local
search in South Africa. This result is consistent with
the demographics of those countries where most of the

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we study the impact of local and global
images on the formation of female physical attractiveness stereotypes. We start by analyzing the co-occurrence of images returned by search engines in the context of
pictures of women. We queried and downloaded thousands of images from different search engines (Google
and Bing), distinct queries (woman, beautiful woman
and ugly woman), originally provided to 42 different
countries. We showed that repetition occurs across our
datasets, and it is more pronounced for “ugly woman”
pictures. By comparing and calculating the similarity metric between pairs of search results we found out
that images between services and between queries tend
to differ, while images between countries present very
high similarity for countries that speak the same language, forming “language clusters”. When submitting
local queries we observe that the similarity between
countries is nearly eliminated. Also, querying locally
gives us a more trustworthy racial profile in some cases,
reflecting the actual demographics of those particular
countries. Our findings highlight and evidence the fact
that results from search engines are biased towards the
language used to query the system, which may impose
certain stereotypes that are often very different from
the majority of the female population of the country.
Furthermore, our methodology for investigating search
engine bias by analyzing only the input and output is a
contribution by itself.
