Abstract
Google’s Top stories is a component of Google Search
that frequently surfaces current news when a user performs a search. Our one-year long audit of Google’s
search results for the candidates of the 2020 US Presidential Elections indicated that the composition of the
Top stories panel shows an unbalanced amplification of
far-right news publishers.

Introduction
In their book “Network Propaganda” (Benkler, Faris, and
Roberts 2018), the authors consider a set of actors and technological drivers that have been identified as causing the
present state of information disorder, among others, “fake
news” entrepreneurs, political clickbait fabricators; Russian hackers, bots, and sockpuppets; the Facebook Newsfeed algorithm and online echochambers; Cambridge Analytica; and white supremacists and alt-right trolls. Ultimately, they settle on the right-wing media ecosystem as
“the primary culprit in sowing confusion and distrust in the
broader American media ecosystem.” Their analysis is based
on three sources of data: the open web, Facebook news sharing, and Twitter news sharing. Although the book doesn’t
address the question of how people access news on the Web,
it appears to suggest the primacy of social media in this respect. In the aftermath of the 2016 US Election, Facebook
made changes to its news feed algorithm that reduced the
amount of referral traffic to other websites. Thus, since 2017,
search engines have directed more traffic to news websites
than social media.1
As the amount of search engine referrals to news sources
increases, it is worth investigating what news is shown by
search engines. Since 2016, Google, the most used search
engine, has modified its search results page (SERP) interface
to show Top stories, a panel of up to 10 headlines accompanied by images, near the top of the SERP. When the search
term concerns events or people in the news, Top stories is
the first element of the page shown on mobile and desktop
devices. Given that thousands of stories from thousands of

news sources are written daily, by selecting only a few of
them at a time, Google’s Top stories is engaging in what is
known as “algorithmic news curation” (Diakopoulos 2019).
If algorithms are curating news, what choices are they
making, especially with respect to news sources with problematic credibility? Concretely, are the right-wing publications identified in (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) as the
cause of our current information disorder (pre- and post2016 US Election) being promoted by Google Top stories?
Does that apply to left-wing publications?

Figure 1: Google’s Top stories panel for Joe Biden on Oct 2,
2019. All three stories are from news sources considered as
“right-wing” or “far-right” (partisan audience bias > 0.5).
This line of research, which falls under the umbrella of algorithm auditing (Sandvig et al. 2014), is important for two
reasons: 1) more people use search engines than social media on a daily basis. If they are being exposed to news in this
way, we need to understand how algorithms are curating the
news; 2) there is evidence that as many as half of all search
queries don’t lead to clicks,2 because a user’s information
need is fulfilled by the SERP content. Thus, the news headlines that a user sees in Top stories might be all they remember about a news event. Taken together, these headlines can
frame issues in a partisan way and help with media agenda
setting. To exemplify, Google’s Top news panel on Figure 1

Data
We have been auditing Google’s Top stories for the coverage
of the 2020 US Presidential Elections since December 2018
(Kawakami, Umarova, and Mustafaraj 2020). Although we
have data for 30 candidates, we focus here only on the top
five Democratic candidates and the incumbent president,
Donald Trump. Our auditing system has captured the list
(and ordering) of ten top stories multiple times a day. Approximately, we collected 80,000 news articles from 2,168
news sources. We then use the Partisan Audience Bias scores
dataset (Robertson et al. 2018) to assign a partisanship score
to news sources. The scores are between -1 (far left) to +1
(far right). For example, Breitbart News has a score of 0.74
and LGTBQ Nation a score of -0.77. To simplify our analysis, sources with scores (-1, -0.5) are labeled as “far left”,
those in (-0.5, 0.0) as “center left”, those in (0.0, +0.5) as
“center right”, and those in (+0.5, +1) as “far right”. These
numbers reflect the partisanship of their audience and might
not be an objective measure of the news sources bias.

Results
For each of the four categories above, we calculated the proportion of occurrences of news articles from corresponding
news outlets. The results are summarized in Table 1. What is
important to notice here is the dominance of the “center left”
sources (which is known as mainstream media) especially
for Donald Trump, as well as the disproportionate amount
of far-right media coverage, especially for the front-runner
Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.

groups of partisan audience bias: FL - Far Left, CL - Center
Left, CR - Center Right, FR - Far Right.
This unbalanced coverage of Joe Biden is captured better
in Figure 2, which shows the stark contrast between all four
groups of media. There was a reason for this: Joe Biden was
seen as the candidate who was most likely to beat President
Trump in the election. Thus, news outlets who support the
president focused on aggressively covering Biden’s candidacy. Meanwhile, far-left sources focused more on Bernie
Sanders, given his political ageenda.

Discussion
Is Google’s Top stories algorithm reflecting user’s demand
for news; the uneven supply from the news publishers; or
trying to impose the so-called “fairness doctrine” (Simmons

outlets in the partisan audience bias spectrum for Joe Biden’s

1978), which was a policy implemented in the United States
from 1949-1987, demanding from broadcasters the coverage
of opposing views. Since overall there are fewer far-right
news sources compared to the rest of the field, they are disproportionately represented in Top stories. Should that be
considered fair? Given the findings from (Benkler, Faris, and
Roberts 2018) on the role that the Breitbart-led right-wing
news ecosystem played in the 2016 US election, setting the
news agenda, by focusing on immigration fears and alleged
Clinton’s corruption, our results indicate a possible scenario
repetition. Thus, we invite discussion on the principles that
should underlie algorithmic news curation.
