ABSTRACT
Modern society increasingly relies on Information Retrieval systems
to answer various information needs. Since this impacts society
in many ways, there has been a great deal of work to ensure the
fairness of these systems, and to prevent societal harms. There is a
prevalent risk of failing to model the entire system, where nefarious
actors can produce harm outside the scope of fairness metrics. We
demonstrate the practical possibility of this risk through UNFair, a
ranking system that achieves performance and measured fairness
competitive with current state-of-the-art, while simultaneously being manipulative in setup. UNFair demonstrates how adhering to
a fairness metric, Amortized Equity, can be insufficient to prevent
Search Engine Manipulation. This possibility of manipulation bypassing a fairness metric discourages imposing a fairness metric
ahead of time, and motivates instead a more holistic approach to
fairness assessments.

INTRODUCTION

Modern society increasingly relies on Information Retrieval systems
to answer various information needs, ranging from high impact
applications like healthcare [16] and automated fact checking [39]
to more everyday problems such as fashion matching [46] and
music recommendation [25]. Since Information Retrieval systems
impact society in many ways, there has been a great deal of work
to ensure the fairness of these systems. While it is easy to see why
automated fact checking requires some care, nearly all Information

Retrieval systems have some fairness concerns, and there is a broad
spectrum of efforts to increase fairness in these systems [8, 22].
While these efforts are all for the greater good, many authors do
not cite the harms they aim to address [5, 15]. This has the risk of
fairness interventions being deployed in situations where they do
not mitigate the harm they ought to address, or where a fairness
metric is kept in use although it does not adequately measure the
harm in the situation.
Selbst et al. provide an excellent overview of difficulties in abstracting the complicated notion of fairness, by indicating five traps
that fair-ML work falls into. First and foremost of these is the Framing Trap, or "[The] failure to model the entire system over which a
social criterion, such as fairness, will be enforced". This means an
algorithm can appear fair to a model, while the algorithm causes
societal harm outside the scope of assessment [44]. While the theoretical possibility of the Framing Trap is well-established, there is
little practical research demonstrating where and how these harms
could enter a system.
We demonstrate the dangers of the Framing Trap through UNFair, a novel ranking system that achieves performance and measured fairness competitive with current state-of-the-art, while being
clearly manipulative in setup. UNFair demonstrates how failing to
model the entire system can result in Search Engine Manipulation
while adhering to a specific fairness metric: Amortized Equity [4].
If manipulating Amortized Inequity is possible, imposing a fairness
metric ahead of time might be insufficient to prevent societal harm,
which motivates a more holistic approach to fairness assessments
[1, 26].
In Section 2, we will introduce Search Engine Manipulation as a
harm in Information Retrieval. In section 3, we provide a technical
specification of the model in which we have built our Information
Retrieval System. In section 4, we look at Amortized Equity, a
common fairness metric, and introduce our own metric to assess
Search Engine Manipulation. In section 5, we introduce our own
ranking system, UNFair, to illustrate how ranking systems could
bypass carelessly applied fairness metrics. In section 6, we show
our experimental setup and the results thereof. In section 7, we
discuss our findings, and provide an outlook for research in Fair
Ranking.

SEARCH ENGINE MANIPULATION

As illustration of the societal harms that can result from Information Retrieval systems, we use the Search Engine Manipulation
Effect. Epstein and Robertson [13] held an experiment in which they
showed participants the results of a mock search engine, manipulated to be heavily politically skewed; their experimental design
can be found in Figure 1. First, they polled their participants on a
prospective election. They then asked the participants to interact
with the search engine results page that was biased towards one
of the candidates. They then polled the participants again, to see
whether a shift had taken place. The results varied strongly with
participants’ features, and their prior knowledge of the election.
The net probability of influencing a vote in the direction of the
manipulation could be as high as 25% to the most susceptible subgroup of the population: poorly informed, moderate voters [13]. By
contrast, the least susceptible subgroup showed a slight negative
response, making it less likely for the participant to vote for the
candidate favoured by the search results.

Figure 1: Experimental design of the Search Engine Manipulation Effect, taken from [13]. Condition C is a neutral condition, with conditions A and B skew towards Left and Right
respectively. Conditions D and E are altered versions of condition B to mask the bias in the results.
The manipulation of search results can be difficult to detect for
end-users. Since each user only interacts with the search engine a
limited amount of times, it can be hard to find patterns in the results
provided by a search engine. Additionally, we cannot expect users
to have the expertise required to detect bias in search results if they
use a search engine to acquire knowledge in the first place. The
powerful position in which large tech companies find themselves,
combined with the inability for individuals to realize something is
afoot, makes for a nasty problem if manipulation through search
engines does take place.
Although there are no direct examples of Search Engine Manipulation being used with malicious intent, there are adjacent
cases. In the 2012 US Election, the Obama administration cooperated narrowly with Google to ensure electoral advantage [47].
Google could leverage their swathes of personal data to estimate
"persuasion scores"; they could then target advertisements towards
those individuals that were easiest to persuade, to ensure maximal
impact. Similarly, in the 2016 US Election, the Trump administration

831

narrowly cooperated with Cambridge Analytica on Facebook to
micro-target advertisements specifically to those most susceptible
to them [3] – Cambridge Analytica claims to have done the same
in several other elections around the globe [38]. While these examples are not necessarily Search Engine Manipulation - and their
effectiveness unclear [11, 17, 20, 36] - they show that these tech
giants are moving in political spheres with the intent of granting
electoral advantage.

3 MODEL SPECIFICATION
3.1 Learning-to-Rank
We must first formalize an abstraction of an Information Retrieval
system to investigate how societal harm may result from Information Retrieval systems. Table 1 contains an overview of the notation
used in this paper.
The core task of an Information Retrieval system is to rank a set
of documents D = {𝑑𝑖 } optimally given a query. Primarily, we want
to show users those documents they want to see, but as section 4
will show, other conditions (diversity of results, non-discrimination,
fairness) can be imposed as well. We use an online Learning-to-Rank
model, which entails that at the start of a session, the model does
not have any information on how much the population is interested
in each document: it will have to learn by doing [23]. Learning-toRank is common in Information Retrieval, where frequently corpora
are too large to rely on expert judgements. Instead, Learning-toRank algorithms are used to dynamically ensure that users of a
model are shown good results, even with relatively sparse feedback.
We build our Information Retrieval system in the model used in
Morik et al. [27]. Following Morik et al. [27], we observe a political
news site. Assume the editors of the site have selected 30 documents
𝑑𝑖 to be displayed to users, and the Learning-to-Rank algorithm
must rank these documents by estimated relevance, using the data
users provide: in this case, clicks. Sequentially, users 𝑥𝑡 ∈ X come
to the site, and are presented with a ranking of documents. Looking
through these documents, the user will give attention 𝑎𝑑𝑡 to docu𝑖
ments, or alternatively phrased, the documents get exposure. As a
user is exposed to these documents, they will click on whichever
documents they are interested in. These clicks are registered by
the model as 𝑐𝑑𝑡 . The ranking system’s target is then to interpret
𝑖
these clicks to produce the best ranking according to some quality
standard; relevance, fairness, or any other definition.
Morik et al. [27] introduces two rankers: D-ULTR(Glob), standing
for Dynamic-Unbiased Learning-To-Rank(Global) and FairCo. We
will now take a look at D-ULTR(Glob); we take a closer look at
FairCo in section 5.1. Both FairCo and UNFair are extensions of
this D-ULTR(Glob) system.
D-ULTR(Glob) mitigates a bias users have, where they interact with documents because they are at the top of the ranking,
not because the documents are especially relevant to them [19].
This means we cannot use click data as a direct proxy for relevance: the users clicked more on documents that were near the top
of the ranking than these documents deserved. If we assume an
attention distribution, we can use Inverse Propensity Scoring to
calculate the estimated relevance 𝑟ˆ𝑑𝑡 from the users’ clicks [30, 43].
𝑖

UNFair: Search Engine Manipulation, Undetectable by Amortized Inequity

FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA

D-ULTR(Glob) then ranks the documents by 𝑟ˆ𝑑𝑡 [27]. We use D𝑖
ULTR(Glob) as a baseline that is not concerned with fairness issues.
We illustrate D-ULTR(Glob) with a simple example: A user enters
the site, clicks on the articles in position 1, 5, and 18, and leaves the
site. The site registers these clicks, and passes them on for further
processing. Since the user clicked on the articles on position 1, 5,
and 18, we assume the user was interested in these articles, and we
put article 1, 5, and 18 at the top of the results page for the next
user. Since users are most likely to scroll through results from the
first to the last, the user is much more likely to interact with article
1 than with article 18. For the next user, Inverse Propensity Score
then makes article 18 the new article 1, article 5 the new article 2,
and article 1 the new article 3. We do not have any information
on any of the other documents, so they remain in the order they
were. After enough iterations of additive feedback, the model will
converge to a ranking that has a high probability of producing
relevant documents for any given user joining the site.

3.2

Technical Specification

In this section, we lay out the details of the model the ranking
system will operate in.
At time 𝑡, a user 𝑥𝑡 visits the page, and requires a ranking of
the documents 𝑑𝑖 ∈ D. The user-base is made up of two smaller
sub-populations. The left-wing sub-population is drawn from a
normal distribution centered around −0.5, and analogously, the
right-wing sub-population is drawn from a normal distribution
centered around 0.5. We truncate the distributions of users to [−1, 1]
for ease of graphing; this does not result in any substantial changes
to the results of any experiments. The portion of left-wing users
is represented by 𝑝 left . In this model, we assume that everyone is
either left-wing or right-wing, so the portion of right-wing users is
given by 1 − 𝑝 left . Combining these concepts, the political lean of
users is given by

𝑥𝑡 finding document 𝑑𝑖 relevant, we have

𝑅(𝑥𝑡 , 𝑑𝑖 ) = 𝑒

𝑟𝑑𝑡 ∼ Bernoulli(𝑝 = 𝑅(𝑥𝑡 , 𝑑𝑖 ))
𝑖

Unfortunately, outside of a laboratorium setting, we cannot directly observe relevance; rather, we are restricted to observing user
interactions with documents. For a user to interact with a document, they must both find the document relevant, and have seen it
in the first place. We assume the attention a user gives an article
is dependent on the position a document gets in the ranking; the
higher the document ranks, the more likely it is for a user to see it
[19]. We denote the rank document 𝑑𝑖 gets for user 𝑥𝑡 under system
𝜋 as 𝜋 (𝑑𝑖 , 𝑥𝑡 ). We conceptualize the probability that user 𝑥𝑡 sees
document 𝑑𝑖 as the attention or exposure user 𝑥𝑡 gives document 𝑑𝑖 ,
and calculated as

𝑖

where 𝑝 (𝑥𝑡 ) is restricted to [−1, 1]. Here, a political lean of 1 means that the user is maximally left wing, a political lean of
1 means that the user is maximally right-wing. The documents’
political lean are normally distributed around 0; 𝑝 (𝑑𝑖 ) ∼ N (0, 0.5),
similarly restricted to [−1, 1]. The phrasing here implies a two-party
system; this need not be the case. In pluralistic political system
one can run this same analysis by substituting left-wing with the
party of one’s choice, and right-wing by a fitting comparison group.
Section 4.2 motivates the choice for only two groups, and gives an
indication of how these groups ought to be chosen.
We describe by users’ openness their willingness to interact with
documents that do not align with their political preferences. The
users’ openness is uniformly distributed between 0.05 and 0.55,
𝜎 (𝑥𝑡 ) ∼ U (0.05, 0.55). We also interpret users’ openness as their
susceptibility: their likelihood to change their vote based on the
results page.
These factors interact in a natural way. A user is more likely to
find a document relevant if the political lean of the document is
close to the political lean of the user; the more open a user is, the
more receptive they are for documents that do not align with their
own political preference. Operationalizing the probability of user

832

(𝑝 (𝑥𝑡 ) −𝑝 (𝑑𝑖 ) ) 2
2𝜎 (𝑥𝑡 ) 2

The actual relevance of document 𝑑𝑖 to user 𝑥𝑡 is then 1 with
probability 𝑅(𝑥𝑡 , 𝑑𝑖 ), and 0 otherwise:

𝑎𝑑𝑡 =

𝑝 (𝑥𝑡 ) ∼ 𝑝 left N (−0.5, 0.2) + (1 − 𝑝 left )N (0.5, 0.2)

−

1
log2 (𝜋 (𝑑𝑖 , 𝑥𝑡 ) + 1)

Note that, indeed, attention has the range [0, 1], meaning interpreting it as a probability is consistent. The attention function indicates
that the top-rated document is very likely to be seen, with a rapid
initial drop. This drop then levels out after the first few results,
meaning there is less difference between the documents on rank
20 and rank 21 than there is between the documents on rank 2 and
rank 3.
As before, we require a binary value for a user seeing a document,
leading to the following variable for a user seeing a document:
𝑠𝑑𝑡 ∼ Bernoulli(𝑎𝑑𝑡 ). Finally, a user clicks on the document if and
𝑖
𝑖
only if they have seen the document and they deem it relevant;
𝑐𝑑𝑡 = 𝑠𝑑𝑡 𝑎𝑑𝑡 . The model can only observe click feedback: it does not
𝑖
𝑖
𝑖
have access to any of the aforementioned underlying variables. As
an exception, we assume that UNFair has access to the susceptibility
of the users, using it only to ensure the manipulation described in
section 5.2.
Again, let us illustrate this model with an example. A user Robin
comes to the page; they are from the left-wing portion of the population. Robin’s political lean 𝑝 (𝑥 Robin ) is 0.4, and their openness
𝜎 (𝑥 Robin ) is 0.3. They come across a document from ProPublica 𝑑 PP ,
which has a political lean 𝑝 (𝑑 PP ) = 0.2. The probability that Robin
− (0.4−0.2)

2

finds the document 𝑑 PP relevant is then 𝑅(𝑥 Robin, 𝑑 PP ) = 𝑒 2∗0.32 ,
or about 80%.
Here, Robin found the document on position 3 (𝜋 (𝑑 PP, 𝑥 Robin ) =
3). The odds of Robin seeing the ProPublica article are then 𝑎𝑑Robin =
PP

1
log2 (3+1) , or 50%. Now, Robin is a person rather than a concept, so

we can actually be sure whether they see the article, and whether
they find it relevant. It turns out that they do find the article relevant,
and that they see it. They click on it, and the system registers Robin’s
click on the ProPublica article.

4 EVALUATION
4.1 Relevance
We discern three ways of evaluating an Information Retrieval system.
Primarily, an Information Retrieval system ought to provide
users with those documents they deem relevant. To assess relevance,
we use nDCG@10 [18]; the technical specification of nDCG can be
found in Appendix A. Although delivering users the articles they
want to see is an important interpretation of performance, it is not
the sole possible interpretation; we should also give documents
fair treatment. As such, we assess ranking systems on fairness,
through Amortized Inequity. The details of Amortized Inequity can
be found in the subsequent section 4.2. Finally, to assess Electoral
Impact, we introduce a metric to measure specifically Search Engine
Manipulation as introduced in Section 2. Section 4.3 provides the
details of this metric.

4.2

Fairness

Assessing whether any system is fair is not a trivial undertaking.
If users click on document A slightly more than they click on
document B, it seems sensible that the system shows document A
slightly more. If users only have a minimal preference for document
A, but the system always ranks document A higher than document
B, this seems to violate proportionality. The main thing to determine
in assessing a system is then the appropriate level to which there
can be differentiation between documents, before this difference in
attention becomes harmful.
To this end, we divide the documents into subgroups 𝐺𝑛 ⊂ D
which partition the set of documents. Additionally, we conceptualize merit 𝑚𝑑𝑡 as the extent of differentiation that is appropriate
𝑖
- if we treat each group according to their merit, this is fair, and
the further we stray from treatment according to merit, the more
unfair it becomes. This notion of treating each group according
to merit is called Equity of Attention. If we have more than two
groups, we can calculate the Multi-lateral Inequity as follows:

833

Í
𝑛 ∑︁
𝑛 Í
∑︁
𝑑 ∈𝐺 𝑗 𝑎𝑑
𝑑 ∈𝐺𝑖 𝑎𝑑
Í
Multi-lateral Inequity =
−Í
𝑚
𝑑 ∈𝐺𝑖 𝑑
𝑑 ∈𝐺 𝑗 𝑚𝑑
𝑖=1 𝑗=𝑖
With Multi-lateral Inequity, we compare between all groups, and
then average out the deviations [4, 27, 31]. As mentioned by Biega
et al. [4], Multi-lateral Inequity is primarily useful as an optimization target: when unfairness is zero, all groups are treated equitably
according to the chosen definition of merit. However, Multi-lateral
Inequity is less convenient as a metric of the level of skew in the
system. It is impossible to see which deviations from the average
are taking place since all pairwise differences are summed. The case
where all groups are scattered closely around the mean is different in analysis than the case in which one group is discriminated
against, and one group favoured. To ease analysis, we suggest using
a bi-lateral fairness definition for measuring inequity [41]. In so
doing, one has to take care to appropriately choose the groups
tested; one group 𝐺 − for which one suspects unfair inequality and
an appropriate comparison group 𝐺 + . In the case with two groups,
we denoted inequity as follows:
Í
Í
𝑑 ∈𝐺 − 𝑎𝑑
𝑑 ∈𝐺 + 𝑎𝑑
−Í
(1)
Bi-lateral Inequity = Í
𝑚
𝑑 ∈𝐺 + 𝑑
𝑑 ∈𝐺 − 𝑚𝑑
We can attach different meanings to merit, dependent on circumstance. More restrictive than Equity of Attention is Equality
of Attention: a special case where we give each group equal merit.
Equality of Attention can be a good choice in cases where we cannot accurately measure or estimate a document’s value, but it is
too restrictive to use much otherwise. More frequently, merit is
attached to relevance: show a document to users proportional to
the extent that users want to see it.
Relevance is conceptually attractive, but noisy to the point of
being practically intractable. This means that any assessment of
real-world Information Retrieval systems on relevance will have
to either estimate relevance from user behaviour, or recruit judges
have to investigate all documents and mark down the relevance
of each document to their query. TREC, the largest applied Text
Retrieval conference, historically used only binary relevance, which
lacks nuance compares to the different ways in which users might
experience documents in the real world. Work to comprehensively
define relevance in the best way to assess Information Retrieval
systems is ongoing, and has proven to be challenging [24, 35, 40].
To combat the noise in relevance, we can assess fairness across
multiple queries. Here, we accumulate relevance and attention
across the queries that the system has seen, and only compare the
totals against each other, through Amortized Inequity.

Biega et al. [4] introduced the term Amortized Inequity, but the
accumulation of inequity across queries is commonplace, either
through direct summation over visited queries [9, 10, 27, 31, 33,
42, 45], or an expected value over query space [29, 34]. Amortized
inequity can then be used as a target; as long as the amortized
inequity is (close to) zero, both groups have received attention in
proportion to their merit.

5.2

Electoral Impact

As suggested in Section 2, it might be possible to build a system that
adheres to the restrictions posed by fairness metrics, while resulting
in societal harm. To assess whether Search Engine Manipulation
takes place, we devise the following measure:

Amortized Impact =

∑︁

∑︁
© ∑︁ 𝑡
ª
𝜎𝑡 ­
𝑎𝑑 −
𝑎𝑑𝑡 ®
𝑥𝑡 ∈ X
𝑑 ∈ G−
«𝑑 ∈ G+
¬

Here, we assume every document has impact on the reader 𝑥𝑡
equal to the attention 𝑎𝑑𝑡 the document received; the reader is then
impacted proportional to their susceptibility 𝜎𝑡 . As mentioned in
Section 2, Google and Facebook have both attempted to estimate
users’ susceptibility in previous political contexts, with the explicit
intention of influencing elections.
Amortized Impact is a continuous extension of the theory established in Epstein and Robertson [13]. Systems can manipulate
people’s electoral preference by up to 25% with heavily skewed
search results pages, which matches the range of Amortized Impact.
To account for queries that are less heavily skewed, Amortized
Impact scales the impact by the difference in attention the groups
receive.
We acknowledge that Amortized Impact makes simplifying assumptions. It has embedded in itself the disputed claims that one
can assess ahead of time how much a user’s vote will be swayed by
a search engine [28], that every results page has a non-zero effect
on a user’s vote [11], or the more fundamental complaint that the
likelihood of someone’s vote might not be desirable or possible to
capture in data.
Even with these limitations, there is value in examining this
metric as a proxy for real-world impact; most model analysis stops
at the model borders, whereas value can be found in observing the
layer beyond the model output [44]. Other choices can be made on
the exact specification of amortized impact - the following discussion still holds.

5 FAIR RANKERS
5.1 FairCo
FairCo [27] is a Learning-to-Rank system that targets Amortized
Inequity as fairness metric. Since this paper has received the Best
Paper award at SIGIR 2020 and is a general-purpose ranker, we will
use it as state-of-the-art baseline.
To understand FairCo, first recall from Section 3.1 how D-ULTR(Glob)
operates. D-ULTR(Glob) estimates the relevance of a document,
corrected for position bias; we denote this 𝑟ˆ𝑑𝑡 . D-ULTR(Glob) then
𝑖
creates a results page by ranking documents by this estimated relevance. To ensure that FairCo does not allow for any inequity of
attention, Morik et al. modify this base ranker. To do so, they use
Amortized Inequity (equation 1). Amortized Inequity is transformed
into an error term err𝑖 : err𝑖 = 0 whenever 𝑑𝑖 is in the privileged
group, and err𝑖 is equal to the Amortized Inequity otherwise. Ranking by 𝑟ˆ𝑑𝑡 + err𝑖 then produces a ranking system that converges in
𝑖
the limit to having zero Amortized Inequity.

834

UNFair

We set out to demonstrate that a ranking system can result in
societal harm, while adhering to the restrictions imposed by a fairness metric. To this end, we create the Undetectably Nefarious Fair
Ranker, or UNFair. It is important to understand that our intention
is not to contribute to the state-of-the-art of electoral manipulation.
Rather, the possibility of the UNFair algorithm existing motivates
a careful use of fairness metrics: careless application of fairness
metrics might not stop the harm it intends to stop. The code to run
UNFair can be found on https://github.com/UNFairPaper/UNFair.
UNFair is a system with 3 conditions: Baseline, Positive, and
Negative. UNFair assigns one of these conditions to each user, and
ranks the documents based on the condition the user is in. In the
Baseline condition, UNFair uses an appropriate high-performing
ranker; in this case, we use D-ULTR(Glob) as introduced in section
3.1 [27]. The Baseline ranker does not need to be fair; UNFair solves
for the fairness metric through use of the Positive and Negative
conditions.
The Positive condition is a direct modification of the Baseline
condition. Here, UNFair first ranks all documents according to
the Baseline ranker. Then, the Positive ranker finds the first 𝑘
documents with positive political lean (𝑝 (𝑑𝑖 ) > 0), and places
them on the first 𝑘 positions of the results page, pushing other
results down as necessary. This results page is then presented to
the user. The Positive condition corresponds to case A in Figure
1. The Negative condition is defined similarly, but replacing all
instances of ’positive’ with ’negative’, and corresponding to case B
in Figure 1.
UNFair assigns conditions to users by susceptibility score 𝜎𝑡 :
UNFair offers the Positive condition to those users with the highest
susceptibility scores, and the Negative ranker to those with the
lowest susceptibility scores. Herein lies the manipulation: since not
all attention is equal, the algorithm aims to have all high-impact
attention go towards the privileged group, while all low impact
attention goes towards the maltreated group. This means that the
voters that can be influenced, will be influenced towards the positive
group. There is formal equity of attention, while the system can
produce electoral impact.
To formalize this, we keep thresholds 𝜎 − and 𝜎+ : if 𝜎𝑡 > 𝜎+ ,
UNFair uses the Positive condition, likewise if 𝜎𝑡 < 𝜎 − , UNFair
uses the Negative condition. If 𝜎 − ≤ 𝜎𝑡 ≤ 𝜎+ , UNFair uses the
Baseline condition.
Recall that we are working inside a Learning-to-Rank model,
which means that at the start of an experiment, we do not know
anything about the user distribution. This means we have to update
𝜎 − and 𝜎+ throughout a run, to maintain balance between the
different conditions.
UNFairSmooth is the first mechanism of choosing thresholds:
here, the thresholds move smoothly within the domain. After every
timestep, UNFairSmooth sets 𝜎 − = 𝜎 − + 𝜆err𝑡 , and similarly 𝜎+ =
𝜎+ + 𝜆err𝑡 . This ensures that UNFairSmooth chooses the negative
condition more frequently when the discrepancy in exposure is
positive, and vice versa. We investigate the results of choosing the
parameter 𝜆 in Section 6.

FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA

Tim de Jonge and Djoerd Hiemstra

UNFairCoarse is the other mechanism of choosing thresholds:
UNFairCoarse uses only a limited set of possible threshold values. The consequence of this is that we can execute more explicit
control over the model and ensure convergence, at the cost of
some flexibility. For convenience, we use the notation 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑡 =
Amortized Inequity ∗ 𝑡, where 𝑡 is the amount of users. If we can
ensure that |𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑡 | < 𝑘 for some 𝑘, we guarantee that Amortized
Inequity remains below 𝑘𝑡 , and as such, that it tends to 0.
To ensure that |𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑡 | < 𝑘, divide the population into evenly
sized chunks along the susceptibility axis. Then, when the system
is in balance, the system only uses the Left and Right ranker for
the outermost 2%, and uses the baseline condition otherwise. If
𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑡 > 10, i.e. there is an inequity of 10
𝑡 towards the positive, the
Negative ranker takes over the lowest susceptibility chunk of the
population. As 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑡 rises, UNFairCoarse will assign more chunks
of population to the Negative condition, thus stopping the rise
of 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑡 . This will result in Amortized Inequity tending to 0 as
previously explained.

6 RESULTS
6.1 Experimental setup

6.3

Can UNFair achieve Electoral Impact while
maintaining competitive performance and
fairness?

835

What are the effects of UNFair’s Lambda
parameter?

In the following experiment, we only vary 𝜆 in UNFairSmooth,
without comparison against a baseline. Figure 4 shows similar performance between all rankers. 𝜆 = 0.05 performs poorly, while
𝜆 = 0.003 performs best. A higher 𝜆 results in heavier oscillation in
Electoral Impact, where Exposure Inequity is initially driven down
but does not continue a steady decline. Conversely, a low 𝜆 results
in steady, but slow behaviour. These observations are consistent
with the interpretation of 𝜆 as spring constant of a system. As a
middle ground between these two extremes, we retain 𝜆 = 0.005
for the other experiments.

6.5

Figure 2 shows a long run of these systems, evaluated on relevance, fairness, and electoral impact. For this experimental setup,
we Learn-to-Rank the same 30 documents for 10000 simulated users.
In figure 2, the classical trade-off between fairness and performance
is clearly visible [12]. D-ULTR(Glob) performs best in terms of
Relevance, but is unfair according to Exposure Inequity. UNFairCoarse and FairCo have very similar performance on Relevance
and Fairness, achieving 0 inequity with the same performance loss.
Furthermore, we can see that FairCo reduces electoral impact to
0 as well, and that D-ULTR(Glob) does not stray far from neutral
electoral impact. Both implementations of UNFair do deviate from
0, and in UNFairSmooth we can see oscillating behaviour as more
users interact with the system. This oscillating behaviour is due
to the delay between an imbalance on Amortized Equity, and UNFairSmooth’s response. UNFairSmooth’s thresholds move in the
opposite direction of the error term err𝑡 . If err𝑡 is positive, but
already decreasing, UNFairSmooth will still change the thresholds
to be more skewed towards the negative side, thus overshooting
the target. This results in spring-like behavior, as Amortized Equity
will turn negative, rather than finding equilibrium at 0. UNFair’s 𝜆

How does performance vary at different
levels of evaluation?

For completeness, we investigated how the Relevance Assessment
changes as we vary the amount of documents evaluated. In figure
3, we can see the differences between the different evaluations.
UNFairSmooth performs well on nDCG@1, but UNFairSmooth’s
performance declines as more results are evaluated. FairCo and
UNFairCoarse perform about equally well throughout, but always
worse than D-ULTR(Glob).
It is notable that nDCG@30 is much higher than nDCG@5, for all
rankers. This is not reflective of the rankers being more proficient at
ranking all documents. Instead, this is a quirk of the model chosen:
the performance of a purely random ranker is also significantly
higher when evaluated with nDCG@30. As such, comparisons between systems on the same metric are valid, comparisons between
metrics mostly are not.

6.4

In the following section, we will demonstrate that UNFair can
attain similar performance and fairness to FairCo, while reaching
substantial electoral impact. The code to reproduce these results
can be found on https://github.com/UNFairPaper/UNFair. Unless
otherwise listed, we set FairCo’s 𝜆 parameter to 0.01 as suggested
in Morik et al. [27], UNFair’s 𝜆 parameter to 0.005, and 𝑝 left to
0.5. Each experiment uses 30 random seeds, that have not been
previously used in developing UNFair, or in previous experiments.
Within each experiment, we then evaluate all systems on the same
random seeds, resulting in the same experimental conditions.

6.2

parameter can be interpreted as a spring constant; we explore the
effects of varying 𝜆 in section 6.4.

Is UNFair effective at different user
distributions?

Finally, it is worth observing what happens when populations shift.
In figure 5, we vary the left-wing proportion of the population
(𝑝 left ) between 35% and 65%, in intervals of 3%. The same four
systems used before are evaluated here, on 30 previously unseen
seeds. Plotted are the values the system produces after 3000 users
have used the system.
In figure 5, in terms of nDCG, both UNFairSmooth and UNFairCoarse closely mimic FairCo’s performance in terms of relevance, although all are lower than the baseline. We see here that
FairCo slightly outperforms UNFair on minimizing inequity. UNFair does still achieve a serious reduction in inequity compared to
D-ULTR(Glob). In terms of electoral impact, D-ULTR(Glob) has the
most polarized scores. While FairCo mitigates the impact of the
population skew, UNFair does not. In cases where the system is
already skewed towards the positive side, UNFair does not reduce
the impact much; in cases where the system is balanced, or skewed
towards the negative side, UNFair moves this impact even further
towards the positive side than FairCo does.

DISCUSSION AND MOVING FORWARD

Throughout the results, UNFair reaches performance close to FairCo,
while being similarly fair according to Amortized Inequity. While
achieving that, UNFair does not mitigate any of the electoral impact
D-ULTR(Glob) has as baseline. and when reasonable, UNFair adds
a positive electoral impact.
That said, UNFair certainly has imperfections for practical use;
one could create a more refined unfair ranker. However, the point of
this paper is not to provide a new state-of-the-art for manipulating
elections. The point is to illustrate that current fairness metrics need
careful application. Although Amortized Inequity is a plausible
metric for Search Engine Manipulation, we see that a nefarious
actor could create a system that appears fair to Amortized Inequity,
while not reducing search engine manipulation in any way.
The UNFair algorithm is a start towards investigating the limitations of fairness metrics in Information Retrieval, but it leaves some
questions yet unanswered. This paper only demonstrates UNFair
on one simulated dataset, on one metric. While the algorithm is
agnostic to the metric used and the dataset, future research will
have to point out whether UNFair functions equally well in other
circumstances. In models that classify rather than rank, we have
theorems proving the impossibility of satisfying multiple fairness
metrics at the same time [2, 6, 21]. Similar theorems for ranking
would be a very powerful tool to understand the trade-offs inherent
in Fair Ranking.
Scholars have been pondering justice (or, fairness) for centuries.
Given that definitive answers on justice are few and far between,
distilling fairness down to a single number seems overzealous [1,
32]. Rather, any practical application of fairness algorithms needs
to be grounded in the relevant literature outside of just Information
Retrieval [5, 14], and supported by the normative assumptions that
clarify which substantive fairness we are benefiting [7].
It appears that fairness metrics have a very fitting role as canary
in the coal mine; once the canary falls to the bottom of the cage, it
is time to evacuate the mine. However, a live canary does not mean

837

the mine is in any way safe, and building policy to keep the canary
safe is a fool’s errand.
Just because there are limitations to the usage of fairness metrics,
that does not mean the practice has to be abolished [37]. Energy
invested towards the greater good is laudable, and the problem
remains very complex. The suggestion here is that different people
working towards ’the greater good’ could have very different goals,
and making these goals explicit allows us to judge systems more
adequately [15]. In naively optimizing towards a chosen metric,
one could miss their target of reducing societal harm, and be left
with a system that only looks better to the metric.
A more holistic algorithmic design and assessment might be
necessary to ensure fair algorithms. Mökander et al. [26] suggest
Ethics Based Auditing as a method to ensure morally sustainable
algorithms. Ethics Based Auditing expands on the auditing process of trying to assess the system from within the system: First,
one identifies moral values and potential harms, so there can be
continuous evaluation of whether the system upholds these moral
values. This enables us to evaluate whether performance indicators
used still measure the underlying norm, rather than only evaluating
whether the system still adheres to the performance indicators.

CONCLUSION

We investigated Amortized Equity of Attention as definition of fairness, and showed how a system could manipulate electoral results
while being fair to Amortized Equity. The proposed algorithm UNFair achieves competitive performance for a Fair Learning-To-Rank
Information Retrieval system, while simultaneously being clearly
manipulative in setup.

ETHICAL CONCERNS

This paper establishes an algorithm to circumvent fairness measures
to still achieve electoral manipulation. This method only becomes
relevant if adhering to Amortized Equity were to become mandatory, without further qualititative measures. We deem it unlikely
that this work will be used for nefarious purposes.

A

RELEVANCE ASSESSMENT

To start, we can see whether users are shown documents that are
relevant to their interests; this would be performance of a model
in a classical sense. To assess performance according to relevance,
we use the normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain, or nDCG [18].
nDCG is a derived metric from DCG, which is defined by

DCG𝑡 (𝜋) =

𝑟𝑑𝑡

∑︁
𝑑𝑖 ∈ D

𝑖

log(𝜋 (𝑑𝑖 , 𝑥𝑡 ) + 1)

Here, 𝜋 (𝑑𝑖 , 𝑥𝑡 ) is the position of document 𝑑𝑖 for user 𝑥𝑡 , when
ranked under policy 𝜋. DCG in itself captures the intuition that
relevant documents need to be placed near the top of a ranking,
but since the range of DCG can vary between queries, comparing
systems across queries is cumbersome.
To ease comparison across queries, DCG is normalized by dividing by the ideal DCG obtainable on the query. We evaluate the
ideal ranking policy 𝜋 ∗ , which orders all documents by relevance.
The ideal ranker is not practically obtainable, but provides a useful
benchmark. We denote the ideal DCG as iDCG𝑡 = DCG𝑡 (𝜋 ∗ ) and
DCG𝑡 (𝜋 )
the normalized DCG (nDCG) as nDCG𝑡 (𝜋) = iDCG
𝑡
As a result, nDCG is always between 0 and 1, allowing for
comparison across queries. One nuance here is that it might not
be appropriate to assume the user observes all documents presented. The DCG formula can be adapted to meet this need. We
index the documents based on their position on the results page,
DCG evaluated at the 𝑘 th position is calculated as DCG@𝑘 (𝑡) =
𝑟𝑑𝑡
Í
𝑖
𝑑 ∈ D:𝜋 (𝑑𝑖 ,𝑥𝑡 ) <𝑘 log(𝜋 (𝑑𝑖 ,𝑥𝑡 )+1) ) and nDCG can similarly be adapted
to
nDCG@𝑘 (𝑡) =

DCG@𝑘 (𝑡)
iDCG@𝑘 (𝑡)

As a result, we can tune our performance measure to observations made; if users typically investigate no more than 10 documents, nDCG@10 is suitable to assess whether any given system is
delivering relevant results to the users. If we vary 𝑘, the order of
preference of ranking systems can also vary.
