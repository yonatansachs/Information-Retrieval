multi-modal
search
engines
have
experienced
significant
growth
and
widespread
use
in
recent
years
making
them
the
second
most
common
internet
use
while
search
engine
systems
offer
range
of
services
the
image
search
field
has
recently
become
focal
point
in
the
information
retrieval
community
as
the
adage
goes
picture
is
worth
thousand
words
although
popular
search
engines
like
google
excel
at
image
search
accuracy
and
agility
there
is
an
ongoing
debate
over
whether
their
search
results
can
be
biased
in
terms
of
gender
language
demographics
socio-cultural
aspects
and
stereotypes
this
potential
for
bias
can
have
significant
impact
on
individuals
perceptions
and
influence
their
perspectives
in
this
paper
we
present
our
study
on
bias
and
fairness
in
web
search
with
focus
on
keyword-based
image
search
we
first
discuss
several
kinds
of
biases
that
exist
in

systems
and
why
it
is
important
to
mitigate
them
we
narrow
down
our
study
to
assessing
and
mitigating
occupational
stereotypes
in
image
search
which
is
prevalent
fairness
issue
in
image
retrieval
for
the
assessment
of
stereotypes
we
take
gender
as
an
indicator
we
explore
various
open-source
and
proprietary
apis
for
gender
identification
from
images
with
these
we
examine
the
extent
of
gender
bias
in
top-tanked
image
search
results
obtained
for
several
occupational
keywords
to
mitigate
the
bias
we
then
propose
fairness-aware
re-ranking
algorithm
that
optimizes
relevance
of
the
search
result
with
the
keyword
and
fairness
genders
identified
we
experiment
on
100
topranked
images
obtained
for
10
occupational
keywords
and
consider
random
reranking
and
re-ranking
based
on

as

our
experimental
results
show
that
the

produces

with

search
engines
play
significant
and
decisive
role
in
accessing
the
digital
information
ecosystem
every
minute
an

3.8

are
processed
by
the
google
search
engine
and
this
number
continues
to
increase
exponentially

search

arguably

most
powerful
lines
of
computer

in
the
global

that

other

dutton

include
that
search

are
one
of
the
first
places
people

moreover
search

are
the
second

dutton

vast
majority
of
internet-using
adults
in
countries
like

also

on

to
find
and

dutton

study

2017
shows
that

are
the
second-best
most
likely
news
gateway
that
inspires
follow-up
actions
like
further
searching
online
sharing
and
talking
about
the
information
with
others
hence
search
engines
have
not
only
attained
remarkable
growth
and
usage
over
relatively
shorter
period
but
they
are
also
currently
proving
to
be
the
most
trusted

the
motives
behind
using

are
different
for
every
user
users
create
search
terms
differently
based
on
their
intentions
and
likewise
expect
different

or
even
an

even
though

may
not
always
have
unique
purposes
and

according
to

2002
there
are
three
basic
types
of
search
informational
search
queries
where
the
user
looks
for
certain
information
navigational
search
queries
when
the
user
wants
to
visit
specific
site
or
finds
certain
vendor
and
transactional
search
queries
when
the
user
wishes
to
execute
transaction
for
example
buying
something
over
the
years
the
proliferation
of
internet
and
web
search
usage
has
increased
the
volume
of
informational
queries
amongst
other
forms
by
orders
of
magnitude
this
has
also
given
rise
to
multi-modal

it

be

biased
in
terms
of
gender

demography
socio-cultural

the

term
is
very
much
attached
to
the
search
engines
for
what
they
index
what
they
present
overall
and
what
they
present
to
particular
user
this
is
deep
concern
as
people
are
more
vulnerable
to
bias
especially
when
they
are
unaware
of
the
biases
hence
the
romanticized
view
of
the
search
engine
that
the
search
engine
bypasses
the
structural
biases
and
skewed
data
does
not
match
the
reality
at
all
the
influence
carried
by
the

decisions
of

it
does

fairness
in
web

is
the
absence
of
any
prejudice
or
inclination
toward
an
individual
or
group
based
on
their
inherent
or
acquired
characteristics
in
most
of
the
current

engines
there
is
clear
evidence
of
the
absence
of

the

here
this

according
to

jain

there
are
three
limitations
for

image
search
there
is
no
straightforward
and
fully
automated
way
of
going
from
text
queries
to
visual
features
in
search
process
visual
features
are
mainly
used
for
secondary
tasks
like
finding
similar
images
since
the
search
keyword
query
is
fed
as
text
rather
than
an
image
to
search
engine
the
search
engines
are
forced
to
rely
on
static
and
textual
features
extracted
from
the
image
parent

page
and
surrounding
texts
which
might
not
describe
its
salient
visual
information

rankers
are
trained
on

pairs
labeled
with

judgments
determined
by

such
labels
are
well
known
to
be
noisy
due
to
various
factors
including
ambiguous
queries
unknown
user
intent
and
subjectivity
in
human
judgments
this
leads
to
learning
sub-optimal
ranker
static
ranker
is
typically
built
to
handle
disparate
user
queries
therefore
the
static
ranker
is
unable
to
adapt
its
parameters
to
suit
the
query
at
hand
and
it
might
lead
to
sub-optimal
results
in
this
regard

one
way

is
through
the

we
can

to

then

regressor
can
be

to
predict
the
normalized

counts
for

the
final

would
be

this
way
of

tackles
re-ranking
nicely
while
still
coping
with
the
limitations
described
earlier
the
gp
regressor
is
trained
on
not
just
textual
features
but
also
visual
features
extracted
from
the
set
of
previously
clicked
images
consequently
images
that
are
visually
similar
to
the
clicked
images
in
terms
of
measured
shape
color
and
texture
properties
are
automatically
ranked
high
expert
labels
might
be
erroneous
inconsistent
with
different

to

such
factors
bias
the
training
set
that
results
in
the
learned
ranker
being
sub-optimal
the
click-based
re-ranker
provides
an
alternative
by
tackling
this
problem
directly
the
hypothesis
is
that
for
given
query
most
of
the
previously
clicked
images
are
highly
relevant
and
hence
should
be
leveraged
to
mitigate
the
inaccuracies
of
the
baseline
ranker
as
the
gp
regressor
is
trained
afresh
on
each
incoming
query
it
is
free
to
tailor
its
parameters
to
suit
given
query
at
hand
for
example
images
named
tajmahal
jpg
are
extremely
pre-print
version
likely
to
be
of
the
taj
mahal
for
landmark
queries
the
query-image
file-name
match
feature
is
important
but
this
feature
may
be
uninformative
for
city
queries
for
example
images
of
delhi
tourist
attractions
are
sometimes
named
delhi
jpg
also
people
photographs
during
their
trip
to
delhi
may
be
named
delhi
jpg
in
this
case
single
static
ranker
would
be
inadequate
however
the
gp
regressor
aims
to
learn
this
directly
from
the
click
training
data
and
weights
this
feature
differently
in
these
two
situations
here
the
key
assumption
is
that
for
given
query
the
clicked
images
are
highly
relevant
it
would
work
for
an
image
search
due
to
an
obvious
reason
for
normal
textual
web
search
only
two-line
snippet
for
each
document
is
displayed
in
the
search
results
so
the
clicked
documents
might
not
be
relevant
to
the
keyword
the
relevance
can
only
be
determined
if
the
user
goes
or
does
not
go
through
the
document
however
in
the
case
of
an
image
search
most
search
results
are
thumbnails
allowing
users
to
see
the
entire
image
before
clicking
on
it
therefore
the
user
predominantly
tends
to
click
on
the
relevant
images
and
most
likely
discards

there

they

this

the

easily
and
feed
them

such

this

it

because
most

this

ask

for

incorporating

the

we

training

the

showcase

once

compute
the

proposed

we

both

this

us

gauging
the

carefully

that
considers

for

we
plotted
the

our
de-biased

and
compared
it
with
the

having
random

relevance-only

maximum

for

for
the

the

is
59.1

respectively
this
lower

is
primarily
due
to
the
open-ended
nature
of
the

and
the
absence
of
prominent

in

we

we
only
