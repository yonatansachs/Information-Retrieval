Inclusive museum audio guides: ‘guided looking’ through
audio description enhances memorability of artworks for
sighted audiences

ABSTRACT
Museums aim to oﬀer engaging and memorable visitor experiences,
but their visuo-centric bias can prove challenging for people both
with and without sight. Audio Description was developed to
convey visual information through verbal description to blind and
partially
sighted
audiences.
However,
cognitive
psychology
suggests it could enhance memorability for sighted visitors by
stimulating ‘guided looking’. In this study, three groups of
participants viewed nine photographs from the Museum of
London’s collections, with either no audio, a standard audio guide
or an audio descriptive guide. Enjoyment and emotional responses
were similar for all groups. However, one month later, audio
participants recalled more photos and were more likely to have re-
engaged with the collection. Crucially, audio descriptive guide
participants recalled most details about the photos. This suggests
that inclusive audio descriptive guides could enhance access and
memorability for sighted visitors, as well as expanding crucial
access provisions for blind and partially sighted people.

Introduction
Museums in the twenty-ﬁrst century are seeking to become outward looking, visitor
focused institutions that engender audience empowerment (Sandell 2003). As such,
they strive to facilitate positive change through social inclusion, at an individual, commu-
nity and societal level (Sandell 2003). Despite these ambitious aims, museums are per-
ceived by many as elite cultural institutions which fail to be relevant or representative
(Mendoza 2017). In order to succeed, museums arguably not only need to broaden
their audiences to include all sectors of society, but they also need to provide their visi-
tors, both new and existing, with an engaging and memorable experience. It is therefore
crucial for museums to expand the ways in which they engage with new and existing
audiences in order to meet their social inclusion agendas.
Visitors with disabilities may feel particularly excluded when it comes to museum visit-
ing. Although museums are bound by legislation to oﬀer access to culture (e.g., Americans
with Disabilities Act, 1990; UK, Equality Act, 2010), where there is any access provision at

all, it often invites disabled visitors to attend speciﬁc timetabled access events. This not
only requires people with disabilities to present themselves as ‘special patrons’ (Renel
2019), it also fails to facilitate independent visiting. Consequently, many disabled
people still feel that museums are unwelcoming and largely inaccessible (McMillen and
Alter 2017). One solution is removing the necessity of ‘special’ provision. Rather, the possi-
bility of creating and embedding inclusive design solutions should be explored. A poten-
tial example of this is inclusive audio descriptive guides (Eardley et al. 2017; VocalEyes
n.d.), which draw on the principles of audio description, a practice originally designed
for the communication of visual information to people who are blind or partially
sighted (BPS), in which visual information is translated into a rich auditory experience
through the use of multisensory imagery, spatial positioning and historical context.
For museums to provide a rich and rewarding experience, they must engage visitors who
come with a wide range of existing knowledge and interests, preferred ways of experien-
cing a museum, and varying sensory, cognitive and physical abilities. Nevertheless,
despite increasing research and practice interest in the multisensory museum (Levent
and Pascual-Leone 2014), the majority of museums still attempt to engage their visitors
through an environment that is primarily visuo-centric. Much museum interpretation is pro-
vided in the form of written information in the form of gallery text or artwork labels (White-
head 2011) and accompanies the act of looking at a work of art or an object. This reliance on
the visual sense has obvious drawbacks for BPS visitors. However, it also presents challenges
for sighted visitors that are two-fold: where to look and how to look.
Knowing where to direct one’s visual attention is challenging in a museum environ-
ment which will typically present an array of visual stimuli and stands to overwhelm
the visitor (Bitgood 2013). This tends to lead to what can be characterised as browsing
behaviour, where people spend only a very short time in front of any one exhibit or
artwork (Smith and Smith 2001). Smith and Smith’s (2001) research in art museums has
shown that, even where people have physically stopped at a work of art to look at it,
the average time spent looking is only around 17 s. This suggests that for many visitors,
a visit consists of many quick glances at artworks, rather than a lengthy contemplation of
fewer pieces. Smith, Smith, & Tinio repeated this study in 2017, reporting a median view
time of 21 s. These ﬁndings raise the question of how much meaningful engagement can
take place in such a short time. Researchers have advocated reducing the number of exhi-
bits that are visible at any one time, to encourage selection, and to urge a general ‘con-
trolling of visual access’ in exhibition design (Bitgood 2013, 164). There is a growing
interest in slow looking workshops, which encourage visitors to look closely at just two
or three works, allowing them to see things that they might otherwise miss (Brown
2018; Roberson 2011; Rosenbloom 2014; Tishman 2017). Nevertheless, such slow-
looking workshops are currently a specialist rather than a mainstream oﬀering.
Even when a visitor does stop to look at an exhibit, there is variation in people’s knowl-
edge about art and objects, and how to explore them visually. Research comparing
viewing patterns of visitors who are art experts and non-experts has shown that art
experts may scan for composition and form, whereas visitors with little knowledge of
art are more likely to be drawn to recognisable features (Koide et al. 2015). As such,
although visitors with sight can see a work of art, they may not know how to use that
vision to look in ways that draw out its speciﬁc cultural or artistic signiﬁcance, context,
or meanings (Koide et al. 2015; Vogt and Magnussen 2007). It has been recognised that
428

interpretation can support the visitor in recognising signiﬁcance and deriving meaning
from an experience, and that without this support, fulﬁlment is likely to be low (Bauer-
Krösbacher 2013). Some visitors may require more support than others. Museum
interpretation may be missing out on the opportunity to fully engage the visitor, if it
assumes that sighted visitors have the visual literacy needed to direct their attention,
in order to access what they are seeing (Eardley et al. 2017).
The function of museum interpretation is to oﬀer support to visitors in their exploration of
collections by communicating what curators consider to be signiﬁcant information about the
artwork, the artist, or the cultural context in which it was produced (Serota 1996). Interpret-
ation should support engagement with collections by inviting audience participation, arous-
ing curiosity and helping visitors connect to meanings (Gross and Zimmerman 2010).
Ultimately, it should link tangible displays (that can be perceived) to intangible meanings,
and help people to learn new things or to conﬁrm things they already think they know
(Bitgood 2013), as well as developing thoughts and ideas (Gross and Zimmerman 2010).
Audio interpretation, in the form of audio guides, is one form of interpretation that does
not expect visitors to rely entirely on vision. Audio guides are available in nearly all mid-size
and large museums, either built into the ticket price or for an additional cost (Proctor and
Tellis 2003). Conventional audio tours provide short bursts of information, typically 180 s
per ‘stop’ (Aoki et al. 2002), and they have been shown to impact positively on visitor behav-
iour. Empirical studies with quantitative measures are rare, but one such study compared
the behaviours of 42 students, half of whom visited the museum with an audio guide
and half with no supplementary materials (Sung et al. 2008). Observational data showed
that the students with the guide stayed longer at exhibits and displayed more inquisitive
behaviours than those without. Researchers have also observed that audio guides can
help to draw attention to aspects of a display or setting that may otherwise go unnoticed,
with one study observing that visitors crossed a large room to examine a detailed carving
on a ﬁreplace that was mentioned on the guide (Woodruﬀet al. 2001).
Psychological theories of levels of processing (Craik 2002; Craik and Lockhart 1972;
Ekuni, Vaz, and Bueno 2011) may help to explain some of the beneﬁts of audio guides
to visitors. Processing of a stimulus can occur at diﬀerent levels, ranging from ‘shallow’
processing, which is based on the perceptual experience (colour, form, brightness, loud-
ness etc) to ‘deep’ processing, whereby the stimulus incites personal analysis of meaning,
inference and implications (Craik 2002). Deeper processing is associated with increased
memorability of the stimulus, both in working memory and autobiographical memory
(Ekuni, Vaz, and Bueno 2011). In the museum context, perceptual presentation only
(visual exploration) may result in ‘shallower’ processing. Conversely, where interpretation
is provided, the user may be able to interweave information about the stimulus with their
existing knowledge, thereby resulting in semantic or ‘deeper’ levels of processing.
However, audio guides have also been subjected to various criticisms. Headsets are
said to impede the visitors’ interaction with companions and with the museum environ-
ment (Aoki et al. 2002). This has historically led to concerns that audio tours can lock visi-
tors into isolated experiential ‘bubbles’ (Aoki et al. 2002). Other criticisms have been raised
regarding audio guides and their isolating eﬀect (Aoki et al. 2002; Bauer-Krösbacher 2013;
Lee 2017) and it has been suggested that they hamper the visitor’s ability to enjoy the
exhibits with full independence of thought (Bauer-Krösbacher 2013). Audio guides
have also been criticised for being too detailed or distracting (Bauer-Krösbacher 2013).

Furthermore, standard audio guides do not provide adequate access for BPS visitors,
because there may be limited description of the visual details of the object or artwork.
Access is typically provided instead through audio description (AD), either in the form of
a recorded guide or delivered in a live tour. AD has been deﬁned as a verbal commentary
which provides visual information for those unable to perceive it for themselves (Fryer
2016). In museums, AD describes the visual appearance of artworks and objects, including
information such as colour, contrast, shape and form. It may also provide factual, contextual
or historical information to accompany and enrich the description of visual features. The key
diﬀerence between audio description and a standard audio guide is that the audio descrip-
tion systematically describes visual elements and the spatial relationships between them in
order that a blind user may create mental images of the object. In contrast, while audio
guides may refer to prominent visual aspects of the work they are addressing, they do
not systematically guide the user’s eyes from one detail to the next. Analysis has shown
that the prevalence of spatial and visual positioning words is correspondingly lower in
audio guide texts compared to AD texts (Jiménez Hurtado and Soler Gallego 2015). Corre-
spondingly, practitioners distinguish between audio guides and audio descriptive guides,
emphasising that their content diﬀers (VocalEyes n.d.).
There are compelling reasons why AD may provide beneﬁts to sighted museum visitors, a
possibility which is as yet unexplored through empirical research, although practitioners
report beneﬁts (Eardley et al. 2017). Functioning as a kind of ‘guided looking’ (Eardley
et al. 2017), AD may help people to direct, and importantly, prolong their visual attention.
Traditional audio guides may require the visitor to attend to competing visual and auditory
information, thereby raising the possibility that they divide attention and increase cognitive
load. In contrast, AD could provide congruent visual and auditory stimuli to sighted people, as
the nature of audio description would mean that users’ eyes would be guided to a visual
feature by way of the verbal explanation, which is delivered aurally. This may reduce cognitive
load, enhancing memorability, as congruent stimuli are known to increase later recall (Kim,
Seitz, and Shams 2008). Indeed, psychologists advising museum practice have emphasised
the importance of semantic congruence in museum interpretation (Ward 2014).
There are other features of AD which suggest it could stimulate engagement levels even
above and beyond those of traditional guides. Firstly, AD has the potential to create a multi-
sensory experience through its use of rich sensory imagery (Hutchinson and Eardley 2020),
which would stand to increase memorability in sighted and blind people alike (Eardley and
Pring 2006). Secondly, it could provoke emotional and cognitive responses not only
through the information it presents, but also its use of cognitive prompts and narrative
(Hutchinson and Eardley 2020). Creating a story is known to help recall of content (Bellezza,
Richards, and Geiselman 1976), as this is thought to help to organise ideas during encoding
(Craik 2002). In short, the techniques inherent to AD and its potential eﬀect on sighted
visitor attention might impact positively on the nature and level of engagement for
sighted visitors, and the resulting memorability of the experience.
This study therefore sought to compare three ways of experiencing an exhibition of
photographs taken from the Museum of London’s collections. Firstly, through vision
only, with minimal text labels, thereby replicating a typical experience of a museum’s per-
manent collections. Secondly, through viewing the artworks whilst listening to a standard
audio guide (SAG), which provides factual and contextual information. Thirdly, through
viewing the artworks with an audio descriptive guide (ADG), which guides the viewer’s

attention around the image, builds a narrative, employs multisensory imagery and also
provides semantic information. This study takes a longitudinal approach and uses mem-
orability as a basis for exploring impact. In so doing, it builds on the literature that
explores museum memories as a means to evaluate the museum experience (Anderson
2003; Anderson and Shimizu 2007b, 2007a; Anderson, Storksdieck, and Spock 2007;
Falk and Dierking 1990, 1997; Hutchinson, Loveday, and Eardley 2020; Medved and
Oatley 2000; Medved, Cupchik, and Oatley 2004). It also employs multiple measures to
address engagement, such as attention, enjoyment, interest, and emotion.
Participants’ experience and levels of engagement are thus evaluated both immedi-
ately after the event (time A) and one month later (time B). Furthermore, participants’
memories of the artworks are evaluated in order to compare the number and richness
of the memories that result from the three diﬀerent exhibition experiences. The study
brings these aspects together in order to address the following research questions:
ﬁrstly, whether audio interpretation (SAG and ADG) would have an impact on the experi-
ence and engagement of sighted people, and secondly, whether AD would have a
diﬀerent impact compared to SAG. Impact is evaluated through a series of enjoyment,
interest, attention, emotion and memorability measures.
Methods
Design
This was a longitudinal study (time A, time B) with an independent groups design. The
independent variables were time (exit, 1 month) and exhibition experience: no audio
(NA); standard audio guide (SAG); audio descriptive guide (ADG). The dependent variables
were measures of attention, enjoyment of the experience, desire to reengage with the
material and actual reengagement, emotion, memories evoked during the exhibition,
audio evaluation measures (for SAG and ADG participants), recall of the photos and rich-
ness of recall. Photo recall texts were coded to provide counts for various content detail
categories, which were as follows: visual, spatial, event/activity/movement, emotion (per-
ceived emotion of photo subjects) and atmosphere (including nonvisual imagery), partici-
pants’ reactions (emotions, thoughts, and memories mentioned during photo recall), and
semantic recall (socio-historical information/context and information about the photogra-
pher). The data were analysed using ANOVAs, but where the data distribution of the DVs
was not normal, and normality could not be achieved using transformations, nonpara-
metric tests were applied.
Participants
148 participants were recruited via the University of Westminster’s Psychology Research
Participation Scheme; the University of the Third Age (U3A), the Museum of London’s
Friends of the Museum mailing list, and through snowball sampling. Participants were
approximately matched for age and gender, and then randomly allocated to one of
three conditions: no audio, SAG, and ADG (see Table 1).
A one-way between subjects ANOVA conﬁrmed that there was no diﬀerence in age
across groups (F (2, 142) = .17, p=.84).

Materials
Photographs
Photographs were selected from the Museum of London’s Henry Grant archive in collab-
oration with their Curator of Photography. Nine photos were chosen that were all: (a)
taken between 1950 and 1970; (b) taken outside; (c) black and white; (d) containing
people, but with a clear focal point (e.g., crowd scenes were avoided); (e) considered
optimal for the use of multisensory imagery in the texts of the audio descriptions. The
photo shown below is an example of one of the 9 selected:

Audio guides
SAGs and ADGs were produced for the study, in consultation with the Museum of
London’s Curator of Photography and VocalEyes. Both guides included an audio introduc-
tion with some biographical information about the photographer and his practice. An
excerpt of this information was summarised and presented on the initial slide for the
‘no audio’ condition. Both SAGs and ADGs provided factual and contextual information.
This information was given in a more expanded form in the SAG and was condensed
for the ADG, but wherever possible, the same semantic information was presented in
both texts. The SAGs referred to some visual features of the photos but they did not sys-
tematically guide visual attention in the way that the ADG texts did. All texts were profes-
sionally recorded and voiced by a professional audio describer.
The mean (SD) durations in seconds were as follows: SAG: 2 min 35 s (17.8 s), ADG:
3 min 41 s (26.8 s). The ADG texts were necessarily longer than the SAG texts, to allow
for the provision of the description as well as equivalent semantic information.
All 9 photographs were presented in a ﬁxed order to participants in a PowerPoint pres-
entation on a laptop or desktop computer with a minimum screen size of 13.5 inches. One
photograph was shown per slide. The time participants spent on each slide was logged.
For the audio conditions, an embedded Mp3 ﬁle accompanied each photo, and com-
menced playback automatically as the slide was reached. Participants listened through
headphones.
Questionnaires
Two questionnaires (time A, time B) were designed for the experiment. One was adminis-
tered in person after the participants had viewed the photos. The second was emailed one
month later, and was completed via a link to the questionnaire hosted on the Qualtrics
platform. The questionnaire at both times A and B addressed the participant’s experience
and engagement levels, with the questionnaire at time B also addressing memorability for
the photos.
Demographic information
The questionnaire collected basic demographic information: age, gender, level of edu-
cation, whether English was their ﬁrst language. Where English was not their ﬁrst
language, participants were asked to rate their level on a 4-point Likert Scale where
1 = beginner/basic, 2 = intermediate, 3 = competent and 4 = ﬂuent. Participants rated
their frequency of museum visits over the last 5 years on a 6-point Likert scale where
1 = never, 2 = once every few years, 3 = once a year, 4 = once every six months, 5 =
once a month and 6 = once a week or more.
Experience and engagement measures
Levels of enjoyment and engagement were measured through the 7-item motivation
scale of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) (Ryan 1982). Participants also gave
likings ratings for the photos on a 7-point Likert Scale, where 1 = hated it and 7 = loved
it. Participants’ emotional response was addressed by asking them if they experienced
emotion for their favourite photo, and to select emotions from a list, if applicable. They
MUSEUM MANAGEMENT AND CURATORSHIP
433

were asked to rate emotions for valence and strength on ten-point Likert scales (where 1
= negative and 10 = positive for valence, and 1 = barely noticeable and 10 = as strong as I
have ever felt, for strength). The listening experience was assessed through participants
(SAG, ADG) evaluating their experience of the audio by rating 4 items about the audio
guides on ten-point Likert Scales (1 = really hated it, 10 = really loved it), namely infor-
mation, delivery, speed and their enjoyment of it. These audio evaluation measures
were repeated at time B.
Memories, memory vividness and mental imagery
Participant rated their mental images of the photos at time A for clarity on a ten-point
Likert scale (1 = no image, just know I am thinking about it, and 10 = as clear as if I
were actually looking at the photo). They also described any memories evoked during
the exhibition, and rated their vividness, again on a ten-point scale.
Memorability
The Time B questionnaire asked participants to recall the photos by describing them,
giving as much information as they could. Responses were coded for content (see
Design). For example, the memory ‘People enjoying themselves by the river. Tranquillity
in the middle of the city’ would receive 2 counts for visual (people, river), one count for
emotion/atmosphere (enjoying themselves) and one count for participant reaction (tran-
quillity in the middle of the city).
Procedure
Participants were all tested in a quiet room with no external distraction, either at the
Museum of London, a laboratory at the University of Westminster, or in their own home.
For the SAG and ADG conditions, participants were invited to check the headphone
volume was comfortable, then they were asked to open the PowerPoint presentation
when they were ready and to move on to the next image once the audio had completed
playback. Participants in the no audio condition were invited to look at the images for as
long as they would like to, before moving on to the next. All participants were told that
they would have the chance to look again at any of the images at the end of the presen-
tation, and the ﬁnal slide contained thumbnails of all 9 images which they could use to navi-
gate the photos as they wished. No time limit was set for their exploration of the images.
Once they had indicated that they had seen enough, participants completed a paper
questionnaire about their experience. They were then thanked for their time, and
reminded that they would receive a link by email in a month’s time to the follow up ques-
tionnaire, after which time they would be debriefed.
Results
Participant demographics and time taken to follow up
One hundred and twenty-seven participants responded to both stages of the experiment:
no audio = 44, SAG = 38, ADG = 45. Their demographic information is presented below in
Table 2:

A one way between subjects ANOVA conﬁrmed no diﬀerence in age between groups:
(F (2, 122) = .19, p = .83), or number of years of education: (F (2, 120) = 1.28, p = .29).
Kruskal Wallis tests conﬁrmed there was no diﬀerence between groups in terms of the
level of English of non-native speakers: (chi sq = 0.42, df = 2, NA N = 5, SAG = 12, ADG =
8, p = .81), nor in their frequency of museum visits over the last 5 years: (chi sq = 3.44,
df = 2, NA N = 27, SAG N = 22, ADG N = 32, p = .18).
The mean (SD) number of days between times A and B was as follows: NA = 32.70
(4.96), SAG = 31.61 (4.25), ADG = 32.53 (5.61). A Kruskal Wallis test conﬁrmed no diﬀer-
ences between groups for the time taken to follow up: (chi sq = 1.26, df = 2, NA N = 44,
SAG N = 38, ADG N = 45, p = .53)
Experience and engagement
Participants in the audio groups listened for the duration of the audio introduction and
photo descriptions; 25 min 18 s for the SAG and 35 min 10 s for the ADG. Participants
in the NA group (N = 43) spent a mean time of 2 min 50 s (SD = 1 min 23 s) looking at
the photos in the ﬁrst instance (total view time). The frequency of participants who
chose to continue to browse the photos is shown in Table 3:
A series of experience and engagement measures were taken as shown in Table 4
below:
Analysis revealed that the three participant groups had broadly similar experiences, in
terms of their enjoyment of the photos and their emotional responses and levels of initial

(1,78) = 0.219, p = .64), demonstrating that the evaluation scores were lower at Time B,
but there were no diﬀerences between SAG and ADG participants in their ratings of
the audio guides.
There was, however, a diﬀerence in subsequent re-engagement as measured at time
B. Participants were asked whether they had thought about the photos or talked to
anyone about them since, if they had tried to ﬁnd out any further information, or
engaged further with the museum. In the NA group, 40% gave a positive response to
this question, compared to 68% in the SAG group and 60% in the ADG group. A multi-
dimensional chi-sq test conﬁrmed that there was a relationship between participant
group and follow-up engagement: (chi sq (2, N = 125) = 7.37, p = .025), suggesting partici-
pants who listened to a SAG or ADG were more likely to have engaged with the content
between times A and B.
Memories, memory vividness and mental imagery
Participants’ memories, memory vividness and clarity of mental images were recorded
and are shown in Table 6:
Kruskal–Wallis tests conﬁrmed no diﬀerences between participant groups for the
number of memories evoked (chi sq = 0.51, df = 2, NA N = 44, SAG N = 38, ADG N = 45,
p = .78) or their vividness (chi sq = 0.24, df = 2, NA N = 38, SAG N = 37, ADG N = 41, p = .89).
A Kruskal–Wallis test conﬁrmed there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between groups for
mental image clarity for participants’ favourite photo: (chi sq = 8.15, df = 2, NA N = 44, SAG

images.
Memorability
The mean (SD) number of photos recalled was as follows: NA: 3.86 (2.10), SAG: 5.46 (2.06),
ADG = 5.58 (2.37). A one-way ANOVA on photo recall conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of
exhibition experience: (F (2, 123) = 8.27, p < .001). Bonferroni corrected post hoc compari-
sons conﬁrmed a diﬀerence between both SAG and NA: mean diﬀerence = 1.60, (95% CI:
0.41, 2.78), p = .001, and ADG and NA: mean diﬀerence = 1.71, (95% CI: 0.59, 2.84), p < .001.
There was no diﬀerence between SAG and ADG (p = .808).
The photo recall texts were coded for content details and the mean total details
recorded. 10% of the sample was coded by a second, independent rater. The second-
coder was given detailed instructions, including examples (available from the correspond-
ing author, upon request). Inter-rater agreement was 92.17% for the sample. Three
participants in the NA group followed up but did not recall any photos and so were
excluded from the content analysis. The mean (SD) total details recalled were as
follows: NA (N = 41) 25.24 (17.49), SAG (N = 38) 39.45 (22.32), ADG (N = 45) 57.31
(43.39). A square root transformation was conducted on the total details variable to
render it suitable for analysis by means of a one-way ANOVA, which conﬁrmed a signiﬁ-
cant eﬀect of exhibition experience: F (2, 121) = 11.14, p < .001. Bonferroni–Holm cor-
rected pairwise comparisons on the square root transformed variable conﬁrmed that
ADG participants recalled more details compared to NA participants, mean diﬀerence
2.29 (95% CI: 1.33, 3.25), p < .001. ADG participants also recalled more details than SAG
participants: mean diﬀerence 1.05 (95% CI: 0.7, 2.03), p = .036. More details were also
recalled by SAG participants compared to NA participants: mean diﬀerence 1.24 (95%
CI: 0.24,2.24), p = .032.
Finally, participants’ recall of the photos were scored for detail types. Mean counts by
participant group are presented in Figure 1:
Figure 1 suggests that content related details (visual details) was the most salient cat-
egory for all participant groups, with the other categories being comparable in size.
To address the possibility that the richer recall with AD was due to the fact that partici-
pants spent longer listening to the ADG than the SAG, a correlation analysis was con-
ducted on the total time spent looking at the photos and the number of details
recalled at time B for ADG and SAG participants. It conﬁrmed there was no signiﬁcant
relationship: rs = 0.038, N = 78, p = .74. Therefore, ADG participants’ recall of more
details could not be attributed to the fact that the ADG audio ﬁles were longer in duration.
Discussion
This study sought to explore the impact of AD on the experience of sighted participants,
within a museum exhibition context. The study was lab-based, meaning that it did not
evaluate AD in an in-situ museum experience. Rather, AD was evaluated in the context
of the experience of an exhibition. Running the study this way allowed us to control
the setting and thereby facilitate a deep exploration of AD and its impact when con-
trasted to standard audio guides or no audio interpretation at all.

Overall, results indicated that the participants’ enjoyment and emotional response was
broadly similar, regardless of the experience group (NA, SAG, ADG) in which they took
part. In other words, neither of the audio experiences enhanced or impinged on enjoy-
ment or emotional engagement. However, memorability ﬁndings revealed that partici-
pants who listened to audio interpretation in either form recalled more photos than
those who just looked. Furthermore, participants who experienced the photos with
ADG had richer memories of the photos, compared to either those who had no audio,
or the standard audio guide. It is therefore important to explore both the impact of (a)
listening to audio (either SAG or ADG) and (b) the impact of AD speciﬁcally.
Standard audio guide, audio descriptive guide or visual exploration alone:
similarities and diﬀerences in experience, engagement and memorability
At time A, levels of engagement were broadly similar for all participants, regardless of
which groups they were in. Enjoyment of the photos and, where applicable, the audio,
was similar across groups, as was the desire to re-engage with the subject matter, with
all groups expressing a relatively high interest in returning to the subject matter (‘prob-
ably-deﬁnitely’). This is indicative of a broadly consistent level of initial interest across
the three participant groups.
It was also evident from the emotional responses to the artworks and the evocation of
autobiographical memories that the experience had stimulated cognitive and emotional
engagement in the participants across all three groups. The emotional response to the
photos and the numbers of autobiographical memories recorded was similar in all
three groups. There were also no diﬀerences in the level of vividness of these memories,
suggesting that the audio was not interfering with the experience of reminiscing. Thus,
these ﬁndings do not support contentions in the research literature that audio guides
impede independence of thought (Bauer-Krösbacher 2013).

At time B, it was notable that the pattern of content in the photo recall was broadly
similar across groups, with visual details being the most salient. The presence of thoughts,
emotions and the recall of semantic information indicated that a level of cognitive
engagement took place across all three participant groups. This suggests that a certain
level of engagement was possible through visual exploration alone, but this should be
contextualised with the fact that an audio experience of the photos impacted more on
the lasting memories of the artworks.
The key diﬀerences between the participants who listened to audio and those who did
not were revealed through the measures of attention, memorability and subsequent
engagement (between times A and B). Firstly, the NA group’s average interaction with
the photos was brief: a mean time of 18 s per image at ﬁrst viewing, which is consistent
with observations of museum visitors in situ (Smith and Smith 2001; Smith, Smith, and
Tinio 2017). Seventy-seven per cent of ‘no audio’ participants subsequently wished to
look again at the photos, compared to 29% of SAG and 18% of ADG participants.
Taken alone, this measure could suggest higher levels of interest in the photos
amongst NA participants. However, when considered in conjunction with the other
measures, it rather suggests that the initial visual encounter with the photos was felt to
be in some way insuﬃcient when it was not supported by audio interpretation. It is poss-
ible that the initial brief glance was not enough to access meaning, or a sense of having
fully engaged with the photos. This would be consistent with the concept that processing
based purely on perceptual experience is a shallower level of processing (Craik 2002). The
attention data are therefore in accordance with previous research that demonstrated that
audio guides help to hold attention, causing visitors to spend longer in front of exhibits
(Sung et al. 2008), and that looking alone results in a short viewing time only (Smith and
Smith 2001; Smith, Smith, and Tinio 2017). It therefore seems likely that the use of audio
altered participants’ patterns of attention, as they were encouraged to attend to the
images for longer, and that the prolonged attention increased the opportunity to activate
representations in memory (Renninger and Hidi 2015).
Correspondingly, the use of audio interpretation resulted in higher recall of the photos
at time B. It could therefore be suggested that the increased recall in the audio groups
was due to the increased looking time. However, there was no signiﬁcant correlation
between details recalled and time spent looking. Levels of processing research has
shown that further ‘shallow’ processing (for example, allowing more time on shallow pro-
cessing tasks) does not increase recall (Craik 2002). This suggests that it was the depth of
processing permitted by the audio guides rather than the sheer time spent that was
important. Depth of processing was not measured in this study, except indirectly,
through memory. However, increased recall of the photos is suggestive of deeper proces-
sing at the time of encoding, and it seems reasonable to suggest that the semantic and
narrative information provided in the guides would have supported the creation of con-
nections and meaning, thereby forming memory traces (Ekuni, Vaz, and Bueno 2011). A
more deeply encoded stimulus, involving more memory traces, would provide more
opportunities for cues to stimulate later recall (Ekuni, Vaz, and Bueno 2011; Ward
2014). Furthermore, the audio guides, through provision of information, would help to
integrate the stimulus of the photos into participants’ knowledge structure about the
world and about themselves. This suggests the possibility that the use of audio could
support processes of elaboration, whereby multiple aspects of meaning of an item are
MUSEUM MANAGEMENT AND CURATORSHIP
439

activated and thereby linked into the existing network of semantic associations (Bartsch,
Singmann, and Oberauer 2018).
Furthermore, there were diﬀerences between the no audio, SAG and ADG groups in
terms of the amount of engagement that took place between times A and
B. Participants in the no audio group were less likely than the SAG and ADG participants
to have come back to the photos, either in terms of their thoughts, conversations or
follow up research. This suggests that additional interpretation increased the chances
of suﬃcient interest developing for participants to later re-engage with the artworks. In
other words, this later engagement is indicative of the triggering of interest during the
initial encounter with the photos at time A. This is consistent with the literature on the
triggering of interest and its relationship with the development of engagement (Rennin-
ger and Bachrach 2015; Renninger and Hidi 2015), as well as the importance of supporting
content for the development of interest (Renninger and Hidi 2011). It is also consistent
with recognition in museum practice that meaning-making, or making sense of experi-
ence, is to be achieved through the process of interpretation (Hooper-Greenhill 2000).
It is possible that the re-engagement measures suggest higher levels of interest and curi-
osity in participants who listened to audio, thereby inﬂuencing future behaviour between
times A and B. If this were the case, then it may also have contributed to the enhanced
memorability, as increased interest is known to enhance memory (McGillivray, Murayama,
and Castel 2015; Renninger and Hidi 2015), and curiosity has been associated with
increased memorability for novel information (Kang et al. 2009).
The impact of AD on the participant experience, engagement and memorability:
similarities and diﬀerences between SAG and ADG
While the use of audio interpretation (both SAG and ADG) had an impact on the partici-
pants’ assimilation over the month between times A and B, it is important to understand
where there are similarities and diﬀerences between the standard audio guides and the
audio descriptive guides, in order to understand fully the potential for AD as inclusive
design.
Firstly, the concerns regarding audio guides were not borne out in these ﬁndings, as
the guides did not have any negative impact on enjoyment. Rather, they appeared to
enhance interest as indicated by later re-engagement. Furthermore, the experience
measures were broadly similar for SAG and ADG participants. This suggests that using
audio descriptive techniques in audio interpretation would create more inclusive
materials and that this would not have any negative impact on visitors’ enjoyment of
the resources.
There were, however, important diﬀerences between the SAG and ADG with regards to
memorability. While SAG and ADG participants recalled similar numbers of photos, the
ADG participants had richer memories of what they had seen, with higher numbers of
details. As the correlation analysis demonstrated, the richer memories with ADG cannot
be attributed to longer looking time. Rather, there are multiple possible reasons why pres-
entation of the photos with ADG was more memorable than the standard audio guide.
The increased richness of memories may have been related to the ‘guided looking’
element of the ADG experience. It is possible that the congruent nature of the perceptual
information and the semantic information delivered by the guide was able to support
440
R. HUTCHINSON AND A. F. EARDLEY

recall, with congruence in the presentation of stimuli being known to be important in sup-
porting recall in levels of processing tasks (Craik 2002). In contrast, traditional guides may
stand to present competing auditory and visual information, which diﬀers from the con-
gruence of the ADG experience. Dividing attention is known to result in shallower encod-
ing, as deeper encoding requires more attention (Craik 2002). This limitation of traditional
guides could have led to the SAG texts in this study having less of an impact on memor-
ability than the ADG texts.
Furthermore, when asked to rate their mental images of their favourite photos at time
A, there was a diﬀerence in clarity ratings between participant groups, with participants in
the ADG group reporting a higher average rating. This suggests that there was enhanced
initial mental imagery formation in the ADG group. As visual imagery is known to be a
predictor for memorability (Greenberg and Knowlton 2014), this may also have contribu-
ted to the increased memorability in the ADG group. Exactly why AD should have led to
the formation of clearer visual images initially cannot be determined, but it is possible that
the guided looking allowed for a deeper assimilation of the visual content of the photos.
Other, linguistic features of the AD may have impacted positively on memorability,
such as multisensory imagery, narrative, and cognitive prompts. These techniques are
important in AD (Hutchinson and Eardley 2020) and were accordingly foregrounded in
the creation of the ADG texts for this study. The fact that the AD was embedded with mul-
tisensory imagery may have had a part to play in enhancing recall (Chu and Downes 2000;
Eardley and Pring 2006; Gottfried et al. 2004). The formation of mental imagery has also
been employed as an elaboration strategy to enhance learning (Bartsch, Singmann, and
Oberauer 2018; Dunlosky and Kane 2007). It is therefore possible that the use of multisen-
sory imagery helped to create a richer imaginary landscape, with more images and associ-
ations that could later cue recall of the photo’s appearance, content or socio-historical
context.
The use of narrative was also important in the AD. Whilst narrative was to some extent
present in both sorts of audio texts, the SAG texts focused more on the provision of
semantic information, whereas the ADG focused more on the imagined experience of
the photos’ subjects, in order to build a story. It is possible that this use of narrative, along-
side the use of cognitive prompts in the audio descriptions, may have aroused curiosity or
interest, again with positive implications for memorability (Kang et al. 2009). In the
museum literature, narrative is understood as storytelling which evokes feelings, mem-
ories and curiosity, thereby creating engagement (Nielsen 2017). It is therefore consistent
with such deﬁnitions that the provision of narrative and cognitive prompts would be
associated with curiosity, increased engagement and memorability in these ﬁndings.
This study does not dissociate between the eﬀects of AD on attention (‘guided
looking’) and the features of AD and its language (multisensory imagery, narrative and
cognitive prompts), therefore it is diﬃcult to draw any conclusions about which
aspects were most important for memorability. It is therefore possible that recall was
stimulated in any individual instance by the image alone, the words of the AD, or the
image and words in conjunction. However, in terms of developing inclusive museum
resources, this question is of theoretical rather than practical importance. As has been
observed in the museum literature, the very purpose of meaning-making through
interpretation is to create a memory (Nielsen 2017). These ﬁndings suggest the ability
of AD to do so to an extent previously untapped by standard audio guides.

Conclusion
This study was the ﬁrst investigation of the impact of museum AD on the experience of
sighted participants. The ﬁndings present a positive picture for the future use of inclusive
AD in museums for sighted as well as blind visitors, suggesting a strong case for museums
both to increase their audio resources and to incorporate AD in their creation. Making use
of audio description techniques in preparation of audio resources would not only adhere
to inclusive design principles, and thereby help to create a more inclusive museum
environment, but it would also stand to enhance the long-term impact of the museum
visit for many visitors. This study looked at recorded AD, but there is also scope to
explore the use of audio descriptive techniques in live tours. If AD also has beneﬁts for
sighted visitors when delivered live, then its potential as inclusive interpretation would
be increased even further. As the museum sector seeks to meet the changing needs of
visitors in a post Covid-19 world, these ﬁndings have important implications for the cre-
ation of online resources. As museums and galleries develop and adapt their online
resources to connect with visitors who may be unable or reluctant to return to the
museum, using AD as inclusive interpretation could help to ensure that both blind and
sighted visitors are given optimal ways to engage and to form lasting memories of
their experiences.

Sample SAG text: Parliament Hill Lido:
Henry Grant took this photo in the heatwave of June 1957. It shows children playing in the Parlia-
ment Hill Lido in North London.
In this photo, Henry Grant displays his enthusiasm for photographing children enjoying their
environment. Some children are playing with the spray from a standpipe at the edge of the
pool, and others are in the shallow water of the lido.
The Lido was opened on 20 August 1938, in the decade when lidos were the height of fashion
and enjoying their heyday. The construction of lidos was part of a government initiative to improve
the nation’s health, especially that of the working classes. Between 1930 and 1939 at least 180 lidos
were built in Britain. This lido was designed by Harry Rowbotham and TL Smithson, who were archi-
tects working for London County Council. They designed all of the city’s lidos between 1906 and
1939. It cost £34,000 to construct, making it the most expensive of the lidos built in London in
the 1920s and 30s.
By 1957, when this photo was taken, the Lido had been open for nearly 20 years and had survived
a direct hit in the Blitz. On 13 September 1940, incendiary bombs caused seventeen local ﬁres, and
the last one fell on the lido. The ﬁre brigade managed to extinguish the blaze and keep the lido open.

Since Henry Grant took this photo, the lido has continued to survive despite the gradual decline
of lidos across the UK. In 1976, a young boy lost his life there, which resulted in increased numbers
of staﬀand the removal of most of the diving boards. The ﬁnal board was taken away in 2003.
The lido underwent a major refurbishment in 2005 and remains open today, with the addition of
a stainless-steel liner which is said to give the water an extra shimmer. It is acclaimed as an Art Deco
classic and was Grade II-listed in 2009. Measuring 61 by 27 metres, it is a large pool which is packed
with families on warm days, and is popular with triathletes in training.
Sample ADG text: Parliament Hill Lido:
Henry Grant took this photo in the heatwave of June 1957. It shows children playing in the Parlia-
ment Hill Lido in North London.
A small section of the shallow end of the lido is captured in the photo. We stand, with Grant, at
the water’s edge, surveying the scene. Water is to our left, and tarmac to our right, with the edge of
the lido leading up from the base of the picture. This forms a line dividing the action of the photo.
To the right, are two boys and a girl, all about 10 years old. They appear half way up the photo,
standing on the poolside tarmac which looks rough under their bare feet. They crowd around a
standpipe which sends a jet of water spraying into the lido. The two boys are in front of the girl,
closest to the pipe, and their wet hair is plastered against their foreheads. They are wearing plain
dark swimming trunks. One boy has his hand in the jet of water, forcing it up and over his playmates
in the pool. A girl in a plain dark swimming costume stands behind him. Her right hand is on the
boy’s back as she reaches past him, jostling for position at the source of the stream of water.
To the left, are around 12 children of similar age, girls and boys, ankle deep in the lido. They run
towards the roaring spray of water. It forms an arch and patters like heavy rainfall as it cascades into
the pool. They raise their arms and stretch out their hands to feel the force of the cool water as it
batters against their faces.
In the foreground is a young boy about 3 or 4 paces away from us. He stands still, ankle deep,
drawing his shoulders up towards his ears, holding his arms away from his sides. His body is tense,
his rib cage showing, as if the coldness of the water has caused a sharp intake of breath. Exhilarated,
a broad grin spreads across his face as he glances past the camera.
The photo has been taken with the camera angled towards the ground. The sky line is high and
the clear, cloudless sky takes up only the top ﬁfth of the photo. The horizon line is made up of a row
of terraced houses and, in front of them, three elm trees in leaf.
By the time this photo was taken, the Lido had been open for 19 years. Lidos were at their height
in the 1930s, as a result of a government drive to improve the health of the working classes. It was
built by Harry Rowbotham and TL Smithson, who were architects for London Country Council. The
Lido cost £34,000 to construct, making it the most expensive of the city’s lidos built in the 1920s and
1930s. The Lido is still open to swimmers today. It survives despite the decline of lidos across the UK,
and its own turbulent history. It took a direct hit in the Blitz of 1940 and a young boy lost his life
there in 1976. It has since undergone major changes. These include the removal of diving boards
and the addition of a stainless-steel liner, which is said to give the water an extra shimmer. The
lido is acclaimed as an Art Deco classic and was Grade II-listed in 2009. Measuring 61 by
27 metres, it is a large pool which is packed with families on warm days, and is popular with triath-
letes in training.
