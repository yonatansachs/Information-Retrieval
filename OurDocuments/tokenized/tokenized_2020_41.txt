google
top

is
component
of

that
frequently

current

performs

our
one-year
long
audit
of
google
search
results
for
the
candidates
of
the
2020
us
presidential
elections
indicated
that
the

of
the
top

panel
shows
an
unbalanced
amplification
of
far-right
news
publishers

benkler

and
roberts
2018
the
authors
consider
set
of
actors
and
technological
drivers
that
have
been
identified
as
causing
the
present
state
of
information
disorder
among
others
fake
news
entrepreneurs
political
clickbait
fabricators
russian
hackers
bots
and
sockpuppets
the
facebook
newsfeed
algorithm
and
online
echochambers
cambridge
analytica
and
white
supremacists
and
alt-right
trolls
ultimately
they
settle
on
the
right-wing
media
ecosystem
as
the
primary
culprit
in
sowing
confusion
and
distrust
in
the
broader
american
media
ecosystem
their
analysis
is
based
on
three
sources
of
data
the
open
web
facebook
news
sharing
and
twitter
news
sharing
although
the
book
doesn
address
the
question
of
how
people
access
news
on
the
web
it
appears
to
suggest
the
primacy
of
social
media
in
this
respect
in
the
aftermath
of
the
2016
us
election
facebook
made
changes
to
its
news
feed
algorithm
that
reduced
the
amount
of
referral
traffic
to
other
websites
thus
since
2017
search
engines
have
directed
more
traffic
to
news
websites
than
social
media
as
the
amount
of
search
engine
referrals
to
news
sources
increases
it
is
worth
investigating
what
news
is
shown
by
search
engines
since
2016
google
the
most
used
search
engine
has
modified
its

if

what

they
making

with

concretely
are
the

this
line
of
research
which
falls
under
the
umbrella
of

sandvig

is
important
for
two
reasons
more
people
use
search
engines
than
social
media
on
daily
basis
if
they
are
being
exposed
to
news
in
this
way
we
need
to
understand
how
algorithms
are
curating
the
news
there
is
evidence
that
as
many
as
half
of
all
search
queries
don
lead
to
clicks
because
user
information
need
is
fulfilled
by
the
serp
content
thus
the
news
headlines
that
user
sees
in
top
stories
might
be
all
they
remember
about

event
taken
together
these
headlines
can

since

kawakami

we
have
data
for

candidates
we
focus
here
only
on
the
top
five
democratic
candidates
and
the
incumbent
president
donald

our
auditing
system
has
captured
the
list
and
ordering
of
ten
top
stories
multiple

approximately
we
collected
80

from

we
then
use
the
partisan

scores
dataset
robertson

2018
to
assign
partisanship
score
to
news
sources
the
scores
are
between
far
left
to

for
example
breitbart

has
score
of

lgtbq

and
those

as

for

the

the

in

what
is
important
to
notice
here
is
the
dominance
of
the
center
left
sources
which
is
known
as
mainstream

especially
for
donald

as
well
as

the

they

should

the
findings
