Abstract 
XR technologies are a trend nowadays for enhancing museum visits. Although museum visits are a way 
to enhance well-being in modern cities, there is a question concerning how inclusive they can be, 
especially for people with impairments. In this work, we are interested in people with impairments 
like low vision or hearing problems. In such a context, we investigate the issue of how XR technologies 
can benefit museum visits for impaired people. Based on the literature, we make an attempt to specify 
user needs and associate them with XR technology functionalities taking into account how those 
functionalities have been implemented in current systems for museum visits. To the best of our 
knowledge, there is no system for museum visits that can personalize its features to the special needs 
of impaired persons independently of the type of impairment they are facing. Another challenge is the 
engagement of impaired persons in the design and development of such systems. Our results suggest 
that this scientific domain is in its infancy and a lot of work remains to be done, especially for the 
human-computer interaction community.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, the world is increasingly trying to exploit the advantages of XR technologies in 
everyday life. People have started to become familiar with XR technologies and companies, 
institutions and even governments are trying to exploit this popularity to provide personalized 
services to their audience. In the case of museums, incorporating XR technologies may lead to 
better engagement with their audience by providing distance access to their collections or 
facilitating a better experience in the museum. The potential of those technologies has been 
exploited within museum environments for preservation purposes, facilitation of everyday 
functions like ticketing, or even promotion of the democratization concerning accessibility. The 
focus of this work is how museum visits can be inclusive using XR technologies to promote well-
being in modern cities.  
A lot of work is targeting the use of technology in the everyday life of a museum [1–3]. There 
is also much work for online users who need a virtual tour for exhibitions [4–7]. However, there 
is a limited amount of research that focuses on people with impairments and in most cases, 
applications are focused on only one impairment type. In [8] they state that most mobile AR 
apps for museum visitors do not support hearing-impaired visitors even though this community 
accounts for over 5% of the world's populace. Furthermore, in [9] they state that only 20 of the 
90 low-vision studies recruited participants with low vision. Most of the research in the field is 
based on simulation of low vision. Also, in [10] they state that according to the US Center for

Disease Control and Prevention, 25% of US adults have a disability that “impacts major life 
activities”. 
In this work, we are dealing with the user needs of people with impairments concerning 
museum visits and how those needs can be facilitated by XR technology functionalities to 
enhance the visiting experience in the museum or provide distance access to their collections. In 
this context, there are many questions to be answered: What are the XR technological tools that 
museums use to facilitate their visitors (distanced or in situ)? Is this technology equally helpful 
for all their visitors? What about people with impairments? 
2. XR Technology for museum visits 
Milgram and Kishino defined a lot of concepts related to computer-generated realities [11, 12]. 
Augmented Reality (AR) is about providing a digital layer of information to the vision [13] or 
even to other senses [13, 14]. Virtual reality (VR) “produces a digital environment in which 
visual perception, sense of hearing, and sense of touch are highly similar to those of actual 
environment within a certain range” [15]. Also, VR is there to engage several human senses 
[16]. Mixed reality (MR) is not a clearly defined term [17, 18]. In MR, the digitally displayed 
information tends to be an integral part of the real world. The user has the option to treat that 
object like it is real. For a common understanding, we use the following definitions [19]: VR 
enhances our presence and interaction with a computer-generated environment hiding from 
the user the real world, and AR enhances our perception and understanding of the real world by 
superimposing virtual information on our view of the real world, and MR is when real and 
virtual environments blend. Extended Reality (XR) is used to describe all these realities. 
However, in [20] they state that X should stand for any reality format. Going beyond the XR 
technologies is the metaverse [21–24]. We will adapt the definition from [21], where the 
metaverse can be seen as a virtual environment blending physical and digital, facilitated by the 
convergence between the Internet and Web technologies and XR. XR offers all the technological 
tools that are necessary for someone to build new worlds. It also offers devices for entering 
those worlds.  
Technologies related to XR [14, 16, 19, 25–27] are constantly evolving [28]. We may have some 
categories related to the ability to use these technologies in an indoor or outdoor setting: 
AR/MR can be indoor or outdoor while VR is mainly set to be indoor. Mobile AR can be 
categorized depending on the technology used to trigger the superimposing [26]. Another 
category is related to the level of immersion which depends on the type of device and the type 
of reality. For example, we cannot expect a fully immersive experience with the use of a desktop 
device or with the use of an AR app. The devices used for XR are mobile devices, desktop 
displays [16], HMDs (like Google cardboard [29] and Meta Quest Pro [30], CAVE [31], 
holographic, or smart glasses. Also, new types of devices that could offer a deeper sense of 
impressiveness have started to become common (like Haptic Feedback). AR devices like HMDs 
or smartphones [25] are used because they are portable and can facilitate the display of 
information in the real environment. Caves or desktop computers can be used for VR, while 
HMDs can be used for all XR systems. The most common devices for MR are see-through HMDs 
[32]. XR applications are created using dedicated development kits (commercial or not). There 
are many developments in software for VR (like [33–37]). For AR we have software like [38–
42]. For MR we cannot identify any exclusive list of toolkits or devices, but the abovementioned 
software can be used in some cases [43].  
3. Museums and impaired persons 
According to [44], “in the context of health experience, an impairment is any loss or abnormality 
of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function”. This definition also includes 
losses that occurred during the person's lifetime. In [45], it is stated that disability “is any 
restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of ability to perform an activity in the manner 

or within the range considered normal for a human being” and a handicap is a “disadvantage for 
a given individual resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the 
fulfilment of a role that is normal (depending on age, sex, and social and cultural factors) for 
that individual”. A brief list of impairments includes (according to [45]): 1. Intellectual 2. Other 
psychological 3. Language 4. Aural 5. Ocular 6. Visceral 7. Skeletal 8. Disfiguring 9. Generalized, 
sensory, and other impairments. In [46], they state that impairments can be related to vision, 
hearing, mobility, cognitive, or speech. In all cases, the impairment might be temporary, 
situational, or permanent. 
 
 
Figure 1: Extended reality for everyone 
 
In a study [47], participants highlighted that “the biggest issues in XR technology are overuse of 
motion tracking, lack of flexibility with other hardware, lack of customization ability, lack of 
compatibility with assistive technology, lack of visual, and audio, and haptic cues and an overall 
lack of consideration for most kinds of disability needs”. In this work, we mainly focus on the 
requirements that are required to assist impaired people. To understand the challenges that 
should be confronted when an XR system is designed, [47] determines some directions to be 
aware of: 
• 
Understanding of specific diverse user needs and how they relate to XR. 
• 
Identifying modality needs that are not obvious but required. 
• 
Suitable authoring tools for supporting accessibility requirements in XR. 
• 
Using languages, platforms, and engines that support accessibility semantics. 
• 
Providing accessible alternatives for content and interaction. 
• 
Providing specific commands within the VR environment, which assist with navigation 
to support different modalities. 
• 
Using virtual assistive technologies to provide non-visual feedback.  
It is obvious that each impairment type needs to be treated in a special way. In [48] they also list 
needs together with requirements that are needed to be served to create a system that is 
accessible for people without excluding a type of impairment. In Table 1, we list these needs 
along with the proposed system requirements that provide help for impaired persons. Research 
that is currently available does not deal with all the types of impairment together. In [8], they 
deal with hearing-impaired persons, and they conclude that major elements of engagement for a 
mobile AR application are Aesthetics, Curiosity, Usability, Interaction, Motivation, Satisfaction, 
Self-Efficacy, Perceived Control, Enjoyment, Focused Attention, and Interest.

In Table 2, we present a list of indicative research related to applications facilitating impaired 
persons during museum visits, along with app features that exploit XR functionalities. In all 
cases, these applications try to invent ways to transmit the information that cannot be 
perceived due to the impairment, using another channel. For example, they provide more 
acoustic information to low-vision persons.

5. Conclusions and Discussion 

In this work, we dealt with systems or applications that are specially created for impaired 
persons. Most of the apps target only one impairment, providing ways to help these people have 
a better experience when visiting a museum. Furthermore, we listed several users' needs and 
requirements for any XR application focusing on impaired people. These requirements should 
be followed by application designers to promote inclusion. However, this does not happen 
today. We could hardly see an implementation of one or two of these requirements in 
applications that are for the general population.  
We believe that the research on the use of technology that assists people with impairments 
should be done with the impaired people and not using simulations. In [47] they mention that 
“For AR and VR to become truly accessible to persons with disabilities, then those who are 
experiencing disabilities must be included in the development. In the words of disability activist 
James Charlton, “Nothing about us without us.”. In the future, the systems that are created for 
enhancing the museum experience should adapt to the personalized needs of the persons, 
impaired or not.
