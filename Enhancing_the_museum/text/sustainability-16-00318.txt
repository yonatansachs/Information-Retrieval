Abstract: The aim of this paper is to assess the accessibility of flagship cultural attractions—that
is, museums located in Krakow, a city with a rich historical heritage included in the UNESCO
World Cultural and Natural Heritage List and distinguished by being a recipient of the Access City
Award—for people with disabilities. This research shows the degree to which these museums have
been adapted to receive visitors with disabilities. Assessments were also conducted with regard to
access to the museums’ websites and the possibility for virtual tours of their collections. Out of a
total of 50 museums, 31 were selected for this study, both leading museums in terms of attendance,
such as Wawel Royal Castle, the National Museum, the Museum of Krakow, and the Wieliczka Salt
Mine, and smaller ones such as the Aviation Museum. The research results indicate that Krakow
museums are well-prepared for receiving people with physical disabilities and seniors but are less
well adapted to receiving visually impaired and blind people and hearing-impaired and deaf people.
Analysis of the museums’ websites showed that they are well-prepared in terms of compatibility and
comprehensibility but that they received worse assessment scores with regard to their perceivability
and functionality. Visitors to the museums are principally adults, adolescents, and seniors. People
with disabilities make up 10% of all visitors.

1. Introduction
As shown in WHO reports, over a billion people around the world, that is, 15% of
the population, are currently affected by some type of disability. This number is growing
rapidly due to the aging population, the spread of chronic diseases, and complications
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [1].
The convention on the rights of people with disabilities [2], adopted in 2006 by the
United Nations and ratified by all the member states of the European Union, ensures
the full integration of this group of people. The full inclusion of people with disabilities
involves increasing their activity levels in the public sphere, including via improvements in
accessibility to various means of spending leisure time. Accessible tourism is increasing in
popularity, with an ever-growing number of attractions, hotels, and restaurants declaring
that they are open for people with disabilities. According to the definition provided by the
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP),
“accessible tourism is a form of tourism that involves collaborative processes between
stakeholders that enables people with access requirements, including mobility, vision,
hearing and cognitive dimensions of access, to function independently and with equity
and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products, services and
environments. This definition adopts a whole of life approach where people through their
lifespan benefit from accessible tourism provision. These include people with permanent

2 of 18
and temporary disabilities, seniors, obese, families with young children and those working
in safer and more socially sustainably designed environments” [3].
One of the key concepts in the approach to accessible tourism is the accessibility chain,
defined as a series of transactions based on the supply of products, services, and tourist
experiences required by the accessible tourism market [4–6].
According to the proposal of the UNWTO, this chain encompasses the urban environ-
ment, recreational activities, and excursions [7]. In this context, elements of natural and
cultural heritage are key attractions in the tourist industry, in which accessibility must be a
basic attribute [2].
The aim of this paper is to assess the accessibility of flagship cultural attractions, that
is, museums located in Krakow, a city with a rich historical heritage entered into the first
UNESCO World Cultural and Natural Heritage List in 1978, for people with disabilities.
Currently, Krakow is the most recognised tourist location in Poland, with visitor numbers
exceeding 14 million in 2019 [8]. In 2010, Krakow was distinguished as receiving first
place in the competition organised by the European Union for cities accessible for people
with disabilities and older people, having been granted the Access City Award. The city
earned this title thanks to efforts intended to increase the accessibility of public spaces in
very difficult surroundings characterised by inaccessible infrastructure. This was achieved
thanks to particular attention paid to providing access to historical sites and museums [9].
2. Literature Review
There is a link between inclusive tourism and social and economic development [10],
and many authors contend that this type of tourism can bring additional social and eco-
nomic benefits [11]. Some are of the opinion that accessible tourism should be analysed
across a broad spectrum, as it may also relate to other groups of people with special needs
(e.g., older people, pregnant women, and people travelling with small children) [12].
A review of the literature related to tourism for people with disabilities points to
the growing popularity of this issue [4], but despite the multitude of publications and
the variety of topics, there are few papers that address accessible tourism and people
with disabilities comprehensively. A great deal of attention in the literature is paid to
understanding the specific requirements of people with disabilities. Private and societal
attitudes towards disability were described by Darcy and Daruwall [13]. In their research,
they addressed the issue of how the needs of people with disabilities are understood by
abled people. On the basis of a literature review, they pointed to key differences between
the stereotypical understanding of the needs of people with disabilities and their actual
needs [13].
Research into accessible tourism also involves various interrelated aspects connected
to travelling, part of which is related to transport [14], and the availability of accommo-
dation [15,16] and tourist attractions [17,18]. Descriptions of the accessibility of tourist
attractions on popular tourist routes around Poland [19] and in historical cities are pro-
vided [20].
The accessibility of tourist sites and attractions in Spain is presented in works by Rucci
and Porto [21] and Santana et al. [22], while Espinosa and Bonmatí developed a guide to the
accessibility of museums and other sites on the UNESCO world heritage list [5]. In Poland,
an analysis of the accessibility of tourist infrastructure for people with disabilities [23], as
well as of sites and tourist offers in Krakow, was conducted [24].
Tourism for people with disabilities is a developing segment of the market and brings
with it at least two benefits. On the one hand, it leads to social inclusion, while on the other,
it increases the competitiveness of tourist destinations and yields good financial results for
the tourist sector [25–28].
A very important feature of people with disabilities is also the fact that they travel
during the low season, with at least one companion, and are willing to incur significant
travel-related expenses [29]. One example of an analysis of local tourist offer accessibility

Sustainability 2024, 16, 318

for people with disabilities is a paper on the accessibility of tourist offers in the Istria
peninsula in Croatia [30].
The COVID-19 pandemic showed that new technologies could be used to effectively
increase the accessibility of tourist attractions, especially with regard to museums in the
context of people with cognitive or sensory disabilities. Smartphones with audio guides,
the possibility of directly translating text into sign language, and online communication
tools are just a few examples of the use of technology to increase accessibility [31]. These
solutions are above all used in museums, which, due to the restrictions in place during the
pandemic, were mostly closed [32,33]. However, as shown in research conducted by Gaweł
on Polish museums during the pandemic, despite the wealth of digital offers provided
by Polish museums, visitors prefer a return to a ‘real museum’. Although numerous
technological solutions that were not in use earlier have become a permanent part of
museums’ activities, the reaction of visitors after the lockdown was clear: they want to
enjoy traditional forms of participating in culture and, most of all, value the possibility of
having personal contact with original artworks in museum galleries [34].
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cultural sector around the world
has been very strong. The clash between cultural institutions and the new reality has
been described as “dramatic” and been called a “culture shock” [35]. In the face of the
“forced closure” of museum buildings, the Internet became the only possible channel
through which to maintain the continuity of activities in the field of public collections. The
transformation of many previously planned cultural events into virtual versions involved
museums undergoing a digital transition and constitutes the main impact of the pandemic
on museum institutions [36]. Museums used the time of closure during the pandemic to
adapt the infrastructure of their buildings to the needs of visitors [37].
3. Museums and Cultural Attractions in Krakow and Their Use (Visitor Numbers)
Krakow is perceived as the most recognised Polish tourist destination, a city of culture
and art like Florence or Venice. However, in the Fainstein and Judd classification, it
is considered a tourist-historic city whose principal resource is historical and cultural
heritage [38,39]. This perception of Krakow is also reflected in its entry into the UNESCO
List of World Cultural and Natural Heritage, as well as in the selection of Krakow as the
European Capital of Culture in the year 2000. It is worth adding that Krakow has also been
distinguished as the UNESCO City of Literature and the European Capital of Gastronomy
(in 2019).
Krakow cooperates with other European cities of similar cultural heritage potential,
such as Barcelona, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Nice, Strasbourg, and Zurich (Figure 1) [40]. It
occupies a very high position globally and has a wealth of activity that provides high
quality of life. To the above list, we can also add other cities in Central Europe with a
character similar to that of Krakow and with excellent tourist functions, such as Prague,
Bratislava, and Budapest [41].
At the beginning of the 21st century, Krakow became an important centre for tourism
of international standing. Its wealth and variety of cultural attractions, potential as a centre
for academia, broad range of cultural events, and well-developed tourist infrastructure are
all factors that shape its competitive advantage in the international tourist market [42].
Figure 2 illustrates the upward trend in the number of visitors to Krakow in the years
2010–2023. We can observe an upward trend in 2019, when there were 14 million visitors,
including 3.3 million foreign tourists. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine
have contributed to a collapse in arrivals, which, in 2023, have not yet reached 2019 levels.
Krakow contains some of the most impressive examples of urban architecture in
Central Europe, with more than five thousand historical sites. The most attractive tourist
district in Krakow is the Old Town, with the main Market Square at its centre (the largest
square of its type in Europe), which, together with the characteristic buildings that surround
it, creates one of the most recognisable urban cityscapes in Poland.

Krakow is one of the largest centres of culture in Poland and Central Europe. It is
also an important museum centre [44]. Various types of museums and collections can be
found here: archaeological, historical, artistic, biographical, natural, technical, literary, and
specialist. In 2021, there were 51 museums and museum branches in Krakow, which were
among the most highly frequented museums in Poland. In 2022, the Royal castle, with its
State Art Collection, was visited by 1,785,000 people, while 1.4 million people visited the
National Museum in Krakow, and 888,000 visited the Museum of Krakow. These are the
flagship tourist attractions of this city [45]. It is worth noting that Krakow is continually
expanding and developing its offering of museums. This is important, as one of the greatest
magnets drawing tourists to Krakow is its cultural heritage, and museums are the principal
component of this heritage [46].
The crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic has also affected museums in Krakow.
Figure 3 shows the attendance at selected museums in 2019, 2020, and 2022. During the
pandemic, all museums noted a catastrophic drop in attendance, but in 2022, some of them,

such as the Wawel Royal Castle or the National Museum, already had higher attendance
than in 2019.

The objective of this research was to assess the accessibility of museums in Krakow 
for people with disabilities. We aimed to show the degree to which museums are adapted 
to receiving visitors with limited mobility, sight and hearing impairments, and cognitive 
disabilities, as well as seniors, families with small children, pregnant women, and people 
with dietary restrictions. This research should also provide answers to the following ques-
tions: what percentage of the total number of museum visitors consists of people with 
particular needs, and how well are museum staff prepared to receive such people? An-
other aim was to assess the level of access to both digital and analogue information re-
garding amenities for visitors, as well as the possibility of making use of virtual tours of 
the museums’ collections.

4.3. Research Methods and Tools
This research allows for the diagnosis of the gap in the accessibility of museum
buildings and exhibitions for people with disabilities and the competence of museum staff
in dealing with such people.
To obtain an answer to the questions posed above, research was conducted using the
categorised interview method [47]. In this method, a carefully developed questionnaire is
used for research. This study was conducted between July and September 2023 in selected
Krakow museums. Museums with visitor numbers below five thousand in 2022 were
excluded from the study, resulting in data being collected from 31 museums. Each of the
institutions to which the request to complete the questionnaire was addressed authorized
an employee to do so, who was usually the accessibility coordinator.
The interviews were conducted with people responsible for the museums’ accessibility
for people with particular needs, and the CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview)
technique was used. The research tool was a standardised questionnaire containing 24 mul-
tiple choice and open questions. An electronic version of the questionnaire was prepared
using the Forms application and sent as a link to museum staff responsible for museum
accessibility for people with disabilities.
To evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in the degree to which mu-
seums and facilities were adapted for people with disabilities, a significance test for two
fractions was used (Mann–Whitney U Test) for the so-called top (flagship) museums, where
the number of visitors in 2022 amounted to over 100 thousand (13 museums), and for
museums with an attendance of fewer than 100 thousand people (18 museums).
The Mann–Whitney U test is used for analysing non-parametric data (usually ordinal
data) and should be considered when using ranking data or data that deviate from accept-
able distribution patterns or when there are noticeable differences in the number of subjects
in two comparison groups [48].
The answers to the questions made it possible to assess the adaptation of each of the
museums in question to receiving visitors in wheelchairs, blind people, those with sight
and hearing impairments, and people with cognitive disabilities, as well as seniors, families
with prams, pregnant women, and people with dietary restrictions. The types of technical
amenities in place were also taken into consideration, as well as signage and access to
analogue and digital information.
A separate study analysed the museums’ websites with regard to their functionality
for people with disabilities and the possibility of virtual tours. In addition, we verified
whether the museums’ websites fulfilled the requirements of digital accessibility in terms
of the following aspects:
#
Operability (ease of finding content and functions irrespective of the means of naviga-
tion, e.g., using only a keyboard or only a mouse);
#
Robustness (with programmes used by people with disabilities);
#
Perceivability (the possibility of perceiving content via the user’s available senses of
sight, hearing, or touch, e.g., via audio descriptions);
#
Understandability (texts are written in simple language without containing diffi-
cult phrases);
#
Whether a museum has a website.
This research was conducted using TAW Accessibility Checker software. This tool is
used to automatically test the accessibility of websites and focuses directly on the standards
of the World Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) in identifying problems with
regard to operability, robustness, perceivability, and understandability. Although it is an
automated solution, TAW conducts compliance analysis on two levels: automatic and
manual. Reports on the analysis of individual websites group errors into three segments:
problems (clearly identified by the software), warnings (identified by the software but
tagged for manual verification), and unchecked (outside the reach of the software and
tagged for manual verification) [49]. Methodological limitations are also associated with
TAW Accessibility Checker software. The tool’s analysis of web accessibility is limited

Sustainability 2024, 16, 318

to a website’s home page, so its compliance status does not represent the entire site. The
software also points out potential errors that cannot be verified automatically via the
recommendation of a manual check, which yields more accurate analysis results.
5. Results
Analysis of the questionnaires provided answers to the previously formulated research
questions. The first related to identifying the groups of people with disabilities for whom
Krakow museums are accessible. As shown in Figure 4, Krakow museums are relatively
the best prepared for receiving people with physical disabilities, as 87% of the museums
declared they were accessible to this group of people. A high percentage of museums are
accessible for seniors (80%). The museums are less well adapted to the needs of people with
sight impairments and blind people (74%) and those of people with hearing impairments
and deafness (73%). A similar percentage (71%) of museums were accessible to families with
prams and children. The lowest number of museums declared that they were accessible to
pregnant women (58%).

It is worth noting that four museums belonging to the so-called flagship museums are
also adapted for people with intellectual disabilities, highly sensitive people, and people
within the autism spectrum; they have sensory baskets for such visitors and “quiet hours”.
In the case of smaller museums, only one declared that it had facilities for people with

The analysis of the results of the study shows that museums with higher attendance do
not differ from museums with a smaller number of visitors in terms of their adaptation to
groups of people with various disabilities. Differences in responses to the benefit of flagship
museums in this context were statistically significant at the p = 0.05 level of significance
only in the case of adapting them for people with physical disabilities (U = 1.82); in other
cases, no statistically significant differences were found between museums with higher
and lower attendance, for which the following results were obtained: families with prams
(U = 0.47), pregnant women (U = 0.33), children (=0.77), seniors (U = −0.53), hearing and
deaf people (U = 1.42), and visually impaired and blind people (U = 1.12).
In terms of the answers to question 2, as to whether museum premises were adapted
for wheelchair users, the responses indicated that this was a considerable spatial challenge
(sometimes due to the historical nature of the museum’s architecture), as well as an organi-
sational and financial challenge, with only 9% of the museums reporting that such needs
were met (Figure 5).

(sometimes due to the historical nature of the museum’s architecture), as well as an or-
ganisational and financial challenge, with only 9% of the museums reporting that such 
needs were met (Figure 5). 
 
Figure 5. Reasons for lack of adaptation of museums for people with disabilities (in %). 
A separate problem is access for people with disabilities to dedicated parking spaces, 
with only 52% of the museums providing such access combined with entry to the museum 
via curb-free pavements and ramps or inclines. Adapting premises for wheelchair users 
required special modifications to buildings at a later date (50% of answers). The majority 
of museum managers considered not adapting premises to the needs of wheelchair users 
to be a form of discrimination (81%), with only 19% holding the opposite opinion. In gen-
eral, this provision was not confirmed by the managers of museums located in historical 
buildings, whose adaptation to the needs of people with physical disabilities was limited 
or impossible. 
In answer to question 3, ‘What equipment improving accessibility for people with 
particular needs is available in the museums?’, the responses indicated an appropriate 
width of museum doors (70%), the provision of lifts (66%), and correctly designed com-
munication routes within the premises (43%). In the majority of the museums, an induc-
tion loop has been installed for deaf people (57%). One in three museums had amenities 
for blind people in the form of descriptions in Braille, as well as inclines and access ramps 
for people with limited physical ability (36%), lowered counters in reception/ticket offices 
(33%), platforms/hoists (20%), and automatic doors (20%). Only 10% of the museums did 
not have any of these amenities (Figure 6). 
It is worth drawing attention to the high degree of adaptation of toilet facilities for 
the needs of people with disabilities, with as many as 87% of museums declaring that their 
bathrooms met such standards. 
In the case of facilities for people with disabilities, no statistically significant differ-
ences were found between the museums with higher and lower attendance, correspond-
ing to the following results: lowered counters at the reception/ticket office (U = 0.53), in-
duction loop (U = 1.24), Braille descriptions (U = 1.05), proper profile of communication

of the museums had appropriate pictograms and warning signs, while one in four had 
descriptions in Braille. Audio signals for blind people were only found in four museums.

It is worth drawing attention to the high degree of adaptation of toilet facilities for the
needs of people with disabilities, with as many as 87% of museums declaring that their
bathrooms met such standards.
In the case of facilities for people with disabilities, no statistically significant differences
were found between the museums with higher and lower attendance, corresponding to the
following results: lowered counters at the reception/ticket office (U = 0.53), induction loop
(U = 1.24), Braille descriptions (U = 1.05), proper profile of communication routes (U = 0.09),
elevators (U = 0.33), access ramp/ramp (U = 1.47), platform/lift (U = 0.53), wide doors
(U = 0.15), and lack of amenities (U = 1.54). Only the answer concerning the possession
of automatically opening doors via objects turned out to be statistically significant at the
significance level of p = 0.05 (U = 2.2), to the benefit of flagship museums.
Improvements in accessibility for people with particular needs were possible thanks
to the presence of technical solutions in the museums, as illustrated in Table 1. The
communication routes, lifts and toilets, flat surfaces, and lack of doorsteps make the
majority of Krakow museums accessible for wheelchair users and those with children’s
prams. Half of the museums had appropriate pictograms and warning signs, while one in
four had descriptions in Braille. Audio signals for blind people were only found in four
museums. The majority of the museums (97%) have public spaces that are adapted for joint
use by both people with particular needs and those without.

In answer to the question about which groups of people with particular needs or
disabilities visit Krakow museums, it was indicated that all of the groups analysed are
represented to differing degrees (Table 2). In total, 81% of the museums confirmed the
presence of physically disabled tourists, while 78% reported visits by seniors. The majority
of the museums (71%) reported the presence of people with sight and hearing impairments,
with a lower percentage confirming the presence of small children (42%) and people with
dietary restrictions.

The museum websites were analysed in terms of their functionality for disabled users
as well as regarding the option to take virtual tours. In response to the needs of people with
disabilities, Polish law has introduced the concept of so-called digital accessibility. This
is one of the most important features of websites, mobile applications, and other digital
solutions, and it is intended to aid people with varying degrees of hearing, movement,
sight, and cognitive abilities in the use of such solutions. According to the requirements,
all public entities, including museums, must ensure digital accessibility on their websites
and mobile applications so that they fulfil the principles of perceivability, functionality,
comprehensibility, and compatibility [50].

Sustainability 2024, 16, 318
11 of 18
According to the Bill of 4th April 2019 on the digital accessibility of the websites
and mobile applications of public entities, museums are obliged to possess a so-called
declaration of accessibility, which describes the accessibility of their premises for people
with disabilities. This declaration informs such people of the solutions, but also the
problems, that they may encounter on the corresponding website and mobile application
and in the buildings themselves. The declaration of accessibility must fulfil specific content
and technical requirements and should be available in every language in which content is
provided on the website. In situations where a website is not available, a museum must still
have a fully available declaration. The declaration of accessibility should be updated every
year (by the end of March) and after every redesign or update of the website or application.
Museums are obliged to adapt their websites and mobile applications in accordance
with WCAG guidelines. Their structure is based on four principles:
Perceivability, i.e., the ability to use a website or app using the senses available to users.
Operability, i.e., the ability to find and use content and functions regardless of the
means of navigation (e.g., using only a keyboard or only a mouse).
Understandability, i.e., the clarity of the expression of both the content and the way
the website or application works achieved, e.g., through the use of simple language or
explanations of abbreviations and acronyms.
Robust, i.e., adapting the content and features of websites and applications so that
they work properly for a wide variety of additional user programs (e.g., web browsers and
screen readers for the blind).
Analysis of the museums’ websites in terms of their accessibility for people with
disabilities (Table 3) revealed that they are best prepared in terms of compatibility and
comprehensibility. These elements displayed the lowest number of errors (475 and 745,
respectively). The greatest problem in the declaration of accessibility was found to be the
perceivability of websites (3683), followed by their functionality (1695).
The assessment of individual museums also revealed a certain key disproportion. In
summary, the best-prepared museums in terms of the website’s declaration of accessibility,
that is, those with the fewest problems, are Wawel Royal Castle (99), Galicja Jewish Museum
(110), and the Photography History Museum (112). Meanwhile, the largest number of prob-
lems, both those clearly identified by the software as well as those indicated as warnings
and those tagged for manual verification, were found at the Home Army Museum (3141),
which stood out considerably from the remaining museums.
In the analysis of the accessibility of museums for people with disabilities, given
the current ubiquitous access to various types of technical and multimedia solutions, the
possibility of participating in virtual tours cannot be ignored. Virtual tourism involves
the computer-based presentation of actual places, in which the geometrical properties of
places are presented to the user in such a way that they acquire an impression of actually
being present in the places in question. Virtual tourism cannot exist without virtual reality
and space, wherein computer technology is used to create the effect of a three-dimensional
world in which objects give the impression of being spatially and physically present [51]. A
virtual tour is a simulation of an actual place in which the user can move about freely; it is
a digital solution that mimics any place or space in three dimensions.
Virtual tours of museums bring great cognitive and educational benefits in terms of
faithfully providing users with experiences of visiting museums using one or several of
their five senses [52]. However, in the museums in question, this is not a popular method
of presenting collections, and among the 15 museums analysed, only 7 offer such an option
(Table 3).

6. Discussion
Currently, more than a billion people around the world suffer from some type of
disability. Ensuring that everyone has access to spaces, communities, areas, hospitality,
services, food, pathways, and mobility is a pillar of sustainability. The number of people
with disabilities and the senior population are growing rapidly around the world. In
Poland, in 2022, seniors made up 25% of the population, and their number in 2050 is
forecast to be 40%, while people with disabilities account for 14% of the population [53].
These two groups will form the dominant segment of the tourism market in the coming
decades. The use of tourist services by these people requires the hosts of tourist destinations
and tour operators to adapt to their special needs by means of transport, information, and
tourist infrastructure, enabling the exploitation of the value of the natural environment and
cultural heritage (including museums), as well as by ensuring that staff are appropriately
prepared to serve tourists with various types of restrictions. With regard to existing
museums, this means that it is necessary to obtain funds for the adaptation of buildings

Sustainability 2024, 16, 318

and exhibitions. On the other hand, new attractions, including museum facilities, must be
built in accordance with the “design for all” principle. An example of such an approach
is the model design of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Krakow. This building was
awarded in the “Krakow without barriers” competition for its clear layout of pedestrian
routes, taking into account the access of people with disabilities to the full utility program.
Cultural tourism is key to the development of tourism in general around the world,
especially in Europe. An ever-greater number of people are travelling for cultural reasons,
and they are particularly interested in cultural heritage. Cultural tourism brings huge
opportunities and is a growing trend. Around 40% of all tourists in the world can be
considered cultural tourists, and culture is also one of the most important motivations for
European tourists [54]. Museums can be defined as one of the most important cultural
attractions that serve to satisfy the cognitive and emotional needs of cultural tourists. As
such, they serve a key social function. In this context, they should be accessible to all groups
of people [55].
Currently, there is observable interest in social inclusion, defined as the process of
creating the opportunities and resources necessary for people at risk of poverty and social
exclusion to participate to some extent in economic, social, and cultural life wherever
possible, including people with disabilities [56]. Social inclusion also involves social inte-
gration, which manifests itself on many levels—educational, professional, recreational, and
regarding tourism—and assists in the individual development of people with disabilities.
In line with this process are the activities of Krakow museums centred on making it possible
for people with disabilities to use museum resources at a level on a par with that of other
visitors. Our research results confirm that the majority of visitors of museums are adults
(individuals and groups), with seniors in second place (visiting in groups and individually),
ahead of adolescents and other museum visitor segments. People with disabilities con-
stitute around 10% of museum visitors, and queries about the possibility for such people
to view museum exhibitions occur sporadically (once a month). This is confirmed by
the results of research conducted among students with disabilities from various Krakow
educational institutions, who make use of ‘museums, theatres, exhibitions and cinemas’
relatively seldom (only 3% declared that such visits occurred once per month) [24].
It is worth noting that museums with higher attendance have more amenities for
people with physical disabilities, e.g., automatically opening doors. This seems to be due
to the fact that adapting a space for people with mobility impairments is more difficult
architecturally and more expensive than in the case of other disabilities. A common
reason why museums with a smaller number of visitors lack adaptations for people with
disabilities is also the fact that they are located in small buildings of a historic character,
where, for technical and legal reasons, it is not possible to make changes to the structure of
the interior and surroundings of the building.
The analysed Krakow museums are best prepared to receive people with physical
disabilities and seniors, while they are less well prepared for people with sight impairments
and blind people or people with hearing impairments and deaf people. A similar level of
accessibility was seen for families with prams and children.
The studied museums have taken action to improve their accessibility for people
with particular needs. For people with physical disabilities, it is vital that museums
ensure there are suitably wide doors and functioning lifts as well as correctly designed
communication routes. Other important features for people with limited mobility are
inclines and ramps, lowered counters in reception/ticket offices, platforms and hoists, and
automatic doors. The majority of the museums have induction loops installed for people
with hearing impairments. One three museums have amenities for blind people in the form
of descriptions in Braille. Only 10% of the museums do not have any of these amenities.
It should be noted that there have been considerable improvements in the accessibility
of Krakow museums for people with disabilities. The results of research from 1994 [57]
revealed that access to museums for people with disabilities (in this case, people with
musculoskeletal dysfunction) was limited in the majority of cases to the ground floor,

Sustainability 2024, 16, 318
14 of 18
sometimes even only to certain rooms. In comparison, it can be observed that particular
care is now taken to ensure that museums are fully accessible to various groups of people
with particular needs.
The digitalisation of Krakow museums is not at an advanced stage. The websites
of the museums studied are assessed positively in terms of their compatibility and com-
prehensibility with regard to their accessibility for people with disabilities. The greatest
problem in the declaration of accessibility that the museums were required to present
concerned the perceivability and functionality of the websites. In research conducted on
the websites of 30 museums in Bulgaria, it was found that the majority of the analysed
websites were below average in this regard and did not provide a satisfactory level of
digital accessibility [58]. Research on museums in Portugal indicated similar problems with
the assessment of website perceivability and functionality, although the 576 Portuguese
museum websites studied had higher levels than other tourist entities [59].
The problem regarding the use of internet applications by Polish museums (including
two in Krakow) during the COVID-19 pandemic was analysed by Gaweł [34], indicating
the frequent use of applications such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Tik-Tok for
communicating with potential visitors and, above all, promoting the museum as a tourist
product. For example, the National Museum in Krakow has 103,000 followers on Facebook,
30,000 members on Instagram, and 1890 subscribers on YouTube. Similarly, Wawel Royal
Castle has 140,000 followers on Facebook, 10,000 on Instagram, and over 3000 subscribers
on YouTube. Neither of these two flagship Krakow museums use the Tik-Tok application,
which is highly popular among young people [34].
Cóndor-Herrera et al. pointed out that virtual tours available on physical property
websites can be important tools for assessing levels of accessibility for people with physical
disabilities, such as wheelchair users. However, it is important to use appropriate, modern
technologies to obtain high-quality digital replicas of physical environments [60].
The decided majority of the museums employ staff for assisting clients with special
needs, suggesting the need to suitably train staff. Unfortunately, the majority of tourism
study programmes do not include subjects related to the accessibility of tourist attrac-
tions [12].
7. Conclusions
This research indicates that Krakow museums are well prepared for receiving people
with physical disabilities and seniors but are less well prepared for receiving people with
sight impairments and blind people or people with hearing impairments and deaf people.
The visitors of the museums included in this study were predominantly adults, adolescents,
and seniors. People with disabilities constitute around 10% of all visitors.
The majority of museum managers consider the existence of premises unadapted for
wheelchair users to be a form of discrimination, but for many museums, especially those
corresponding to historical buildings, adapting the premises to the needs of such people
is a significant technical and financial challenge. For example, only half of the museums
have access to dedicated parking spaces. As far as is possible, museums install technical
amenities providing access to their premises, especially their exhibitions. These amenities
include, above all, doors of suitable width, lifts, correctly designed communication routes,
induction loops for those with hearing impairments, and descriptions in Braille. The public
spaces in the majority of the museums are adapted for shared use by both people with
particular needs and those without. The museums also declare that they employ people
trained in providing assistance to people with particular needs.
It is worth noting that museums with higher attendance have more facilities for
groups with different disabilities, so an obvious consequence of this is more diverse types
of customers visiting said museums.
A common reason why museums with a smaller number of visitors lack adaptations
for people with disabilities is the fact that they are small buildings of a historic character,

Sustainability 2024, 16, 318
15 of 18
where, for technical and legal reasons, it is not possible to make changes to the structure of
the interior and surroundings of the building.
Analysis of the museums’ digital accessibility showed that their websites were best
prepared from the point of view of compatibility and comprehensibility. The greatest
problem in meeting the conditions of the declaration of accessibility was found to be the
perceivability and functionality of the websites. Unfortunately, only one of the museums
studied uses virtual tours as a convenient form of making collections available to people
with disabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this method of visiting was often the
only way to view museum collections.
Another issue that could be the subject of future research is the assessment of the
possibility for value co-creation, that is, providing experiences through the participation
and interaction of people with disabilities. Experience consumption depends on the
involvement of both providers (museum managers) and consumers (tourists) [61].
This research demonstrates the significant importance of new technologies for acces-
sible tourism. These can be used to remove physical barriers and improve the sharing of
information and as tools for providing tourist experiences, e.g., augmented reality (AR)
and virtual reality (VR) [62].
The activities undertaken by Krakow museums are part of the pillars of sustainable
tourism [63]. Their purpose is to create equal access to cultural heritage resources, such
as museums, for all people, regardless of their physical and mental capabilities. Thus, the
offering of museums accounting for people with disabilities strengthens the position of this
city, which is distinguished by the Access City Award. Krakow is one of the few cities in
Europe that has developed and actively implements a sustainable tourism policy. Access to
cultural heritage resources for all stakeholders is included in the strategic objectives of this
document [64].
8. Theoretical and Practical Significance of the Research
The assessment of the accessibility of museums for people with disabilities presented
in this article contributes to knowledge of the issues surrounding access to heritage for
people with special needs. The research results are therefore in line with the phenomenon
of social inclusion and inclusive tourism.
The actions described above, whose purpose is to make museums accessible to various
groups of people with disabilities, as well as the technical, organisational, and informational
amenities provided, can be used by museum managers as a case study of good practice.
The results of our research point to the need to conduct further analyses in order
to identify barriers to the development of accessibility at tourist attractions and to seek
solutions for learning and disseminating good practices.
9. Limitations
This research was limited to one type of attraction, that is, museums, and only one
city. Also, this research included Krakow museums with more than 5000 visitors per
year. To obtain a fuller picture of museum accessibility, it would be worth continuing
this research for museums of various sizes and in various locations. This should include
the context of the social surroundings, especially the attitudes of museum managers and
tourism providers towards the problems of accessibility to cultural heritage for people
with disabilities.
