we
live
in
an
information
society
that
strongly
relies
on
information
retrieval
systems
such
as
search
engines
and
con
versational
assistants
consequently
the
trustworthiness
of
these
systems
is
of
critical
importance
and
has
attracted
signiicant
research
attention
in
recent
years
in
this
work
we
perform
systematic
literature
review
of
the
ield
of
fairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
in
information
retrieval
in
particular
we
investigate
the
deinitions
approaches
and
evaluation
methodologies
proposed
to
build
trustworthy
information
retrieval
systems
this
review
reveals
the
lack
of
standard
deinitions
arguably
due
to
the
multi-dimensional
nature
of
the
diferent
notions
in
terms
of
approaches
most
of
the
work
focuses
on
building
either
fair
or
transparent
information
retrieval
system
as
for
evaluation
fairness
is
often
assessed
by
means
of
automatic
evaluation
while
accountability
and
transparency
are
most
commonly
evaluated
using
audits
and
user
studies
based
on
the
surveyed
literature
we
develop
taxonomies
of
requirements
for
the
diferent
notions
and
further
use
these
taxonomies
to
propose
practical
deinitions
to
quantify
the
degree
to
which
an
information
retrieval
system
satisies
given
notion
finally

introduction
we
live
in
an
information
society
where
we
have
grown
to
crucially
depend
on
automated
tools
such
as
search
engines
and
conversational
agents
that
facilitate
access
to
information
the
research
and
development
of
these
tools
is
the
subject
of
the
ield
of
information
retrieval
ir
which
is
deined
as
being
concerned
with
linding
material
usually
documents
of
an
unstructured
nature
usually
text
that
satisies
an
information
need
from
within
large
collections
usually
stored
on
computers
65
ir
systems
are
one
of
the
most
advanced
and
most
widespread
form
of
artiicial
intelligence
ai
ðthey
aim
to
understand
the
meaning
behind
the
user
query
and
respond
appropriately
speciically
in
this
work
we
keep
narrow
focus
where
an
ir
system
is
deined
to
be
one
that
receives
textual
query
expressing
an
information
need
and
returns
ranked
list
of
relevant
items
from
collection
at
their
core
ir
systems
boil
down
to
the
problem
of
ranking
items
based
on
their
estimated
relevance
to
the
query
in
the
basic
ir
setting
it
is
further
assumed
that
the
system
has
no
background
information
or
historical
behavior
data
about
its
user
this
ranking
is
non-personalized
early
ir
systems
relied
on
ranking
functions
that
capture
the
goodness
of
match
between
query
and
document
using
various
heuristics
tf-idf
weighting
31
the
desire
to
combine
multiple
signals
in
the
ranking
function
in
non-heuristic
fashion
has
led
to
the
development
of
learning-to-rank
approaches
in
the
2000s

intuitions
of
what
makes
good
match
are
captured
in
hand-crafted
features
and
machine
learning
is
employed
to
learn
the
optimal
combination
of
these
features
based
on
training
examples
most
recently
deep
learning
has
transformed
the
ield
of
ir
as
well
and
an
array
of
neural
ir
approaches
have
emerged
that
eliminate
the
need
for
manual
feature
design
71
looking
back
at
several
decades
of
progress
we
can
observe
how
the
ield
has
moved
to
more
and
more
advanced
forms
of
ai
which
has
consequently
led
to
more
and
more
efective
systems
at
the
same
time
these
systems
are
becoming
less
and
less
transparent
and
increasingly
more
black
box
where
even
system
designers
may
not
fully
understand
how
certain
results
are
obtained
of
speciic
concern
recently
is
the
reliance
on
ever
larger
neural
language
models
which
can
produce
output
that
is
luent
and
coherent
in
its
own
right
yet
inaccurate
given
the
widespread
use
of
information
access
systems
and
our
reliance
on
them
as
society
their
trustworthiness
is
of
fundamental
importance
it
is
essential
to
recognize
that
regardless
of
the
continuous
advancements
in
user
interfaces
and
functionality
modern
information
access
systems
still
address
an
ir
ranking
problem
at
their
core
these
systems
employ
multi-step
processing
pipelines
starting
with
initial
stage
retrieval
and
encompass
various
applications
such
as
search
engines
104
recommender
systems
and
conversational
assistants
60
thus
ir
systems
can
impact
users
individually
as
well
as
society
society
at
large
for
example
kay
et
al
52
shows
that
users
perception
of
gender
proportion
in
occupations
can
evolve
after
being
exposed
to
manipulated
search
results
thus
balancing
gender
proportion
in
search
results
might
tackle
stereotype
exaggeration
in
this
work
we
associate
the
notions
of
fairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
as
requirements
for
an
ir
system
to
be
trustworthy
the
challenges
of
fairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
referred
to
as
fate
henceforth
are
not
speciic
to
information
retrievalðthey
are
shared
by
several
sub-ields
of
artiicial
intelligence
these
topics
have
been
receiving
rapidly
growing
attention
from
the
research
community
in
the
last
years
as
illustrated
by
the
increasing
number
of
publications
for
example
the
number
of
submissions
to
the
acm
conference
on
fairness
accountability
and
transparency
facct
increased
by
around
350
between
2018
and
2021
the
need
for
safe
and
fair
use
of
ai
has
also
been
recognized
in
regulatory
attempts
such
as
the
general
data
protection
regulation
gdpr
and
the
artiicial
intelligence
act
78
in
the
european
union
the
california
consumer
privacy
act
ccpa
in
the
united
states
or
the
artiicial
intelligence
and
data
act
bill
in
canada
concurrently
it
is
important
to
notice
that
fate
notions
through
the
lens
of
ir
are
diferent
from
the
fate
notions
used
to
study
machine
learning
ml
in
general
when
people
use
information
retrieval
systems
they
become
the
main
driver
of
human-machine
interaction
that
happens
in
real
time
there
is
an
unusually
large
freedom
to
ask
the
system
about
virtually
anything
and
get
an
answer
this
is
unlike
many
other
ml
applications
image
classiication
or
text
clustering
where
people
are
less
directly
afected
by
the
system
predictions
and
where
it
is
easier
to
introduce
additional
safeguards
against
mistakes
and
errors
this
work
presents
systematic
literature
review
53
on
the
notions
of
fairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
in
ir
systems
while
ours
is
not
the
irst
attempt
to
survey
this
ield
there
are
two
essential
characteristics
that
diferentiate
it
from
existing
overviews
30
first
our
survey
follows
systematic
review
protocol
to
provide
comprehensive
synthesis
of
the
available
publications
on
fate
focusing
on
the
core
problem
of
ranking
in
ir
from
1980
to
the
present
day
as
opposed
to
centering
around
the
broader
topic
of
information
access
30
by
following
systematic
approach
we
also
avoid
potential
researcher
bias
we
initially
retrieved
049
papers
following
structured
search
process
and
selected
75
of
them
for
inclusion
in
our
review
based
on
well-deined
criteria
the
complete
list
of
papers
considered
and
their
annotations
are
made
publicly
available
to
support
reproducibility
second
our
scope
is
not
limited
to
single
fate
notion
but
considers
all
of
them
in
depth
we
also
look
at
the
interplay
and
possible
tensions
between
the
diferent
notions
the
objective
of
this

provide
general
overview
of
the
development
regarding
fate
in
ir
over
the
last
decades
from
their
deinitions
and
implementation
to
their
evaluation
as
part
of
this
we
aim
to
bring
clarity
to
the
diferent
dimensions
and
aspects
related
to
the
fate
notions
in
ir
synthesize
key
research
results
and
identify
open
challenges
our
main
indings
include
the
following
the
diferent
fate
notions
do
not
have
clear
deinitions
therefore
we
identify
dimensions
from
the
literature
that
contribute
to
the
development
of
taxonomies
of
requirements
for
each
notion
having
precise
taxonomies
aids
the
standardization
and
operationalization
of
these
notions
speciically
for
fairness
transparency
and
accountability
we
identify
three
main
dimensions
and
some
related
sub-dimensions
however
we
can
hardly
single
out
dimensions
for
ethics
indeed
ethics
is
concerned
with
other
considerations
such
as
privacy
and
safety
which
are
distinct
most
of
the
work
in
the
ield
has
focused
on
either
fairness
or
transparency
signiicant
number
of
studies
on
fairness
or
transparency
tend
be
model
agnostic
and
applied
on
the
output
of
the
retrieval
algorithm
although
fairness
can
be
considered
at
the
individual
and
group
levels
we
notice
that
individual
fairness
remains
largely
unexplored
furthermore
we
observe
that
accountability
is
mostly
mentioned
in
regulations
rather
than
in
the
descriptions
of
the
proposed
algorithms
or
systems
some
tension
and
interplay
can
happen
between
diferent
notions
as
well
as
within
given
notion
dimensions
for
example
tension
exists
between
individual
and
group
fairness
optimizing
one
does
not
always
imply
the
optimization
of
the
other
moreover
transparency
can
reduce
the
interpretability
of
the
system
if
it
is
not
adapted
to
the
cognitive
load
of
the
users
based
on
the
results
of
the
literature
review
we
also
identify
remaining
challenges
thereby
providing
directions
for
future
research
the
responsibility
of
diferent
actors
development
of
regulations
and
new
evaluation
methods
are
few
examples
in
summary
the
main
contributions
of
this
work
are
threefold
first
we
perform
systematic
literature
review
of
fate
notions
in
ir
systems
from
1980
until
now
and
provide
broad
and
reasoned
overview
of
the
state
of
the
art
second
we
take
step
towards
standard
formalization
of
the
notions
of
fairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
based
on
the
outcome
of
the
review
finally
we
discuss
open
challenges
related
to
the
diferent
notions
of
fate
in
addition
to
raising
the
question
of
how
to
build
ir
systems
that
combines
all
of
them
systematic

systematic

on
speciic

question
describing
the
methodology
used
makes
the
process
transparent
and
supports
reproducibility
in
this
work
we
follow
the
guidelines
presented
by
kitchenham
and
charters
53
and
divide
the
systematic
literature
review
in
three
main
phases
planning
conducting
and
reporting
the
review
in
this
section
we
present
the
goals
and
the
research
questions
that
we
seek
to
answer
moreover
the
search
strategy
is
speciied
including
the
source

and
explicit

criteria
for

and

as
mentioned
above
the
ield
of

is
attracting
attention
however
existing
survey
papers
tend
to
either
focus
on
speciic
aspect
of

or

this
systematic

aims
to
provide

as
well
as
its
evolution
over

last
40

2.1
research
uestions
this
work
ought
to
help
researchers
in
the
ield
of
ir
to
have
general
idea
of
what
has
already
been
investigated
over
the
last
decades
with
regards
to
fate
to
get
started
we
need
to
understand
how
each
fate
notion
is
deined
in
the
context
of
ir
and
what
are
its
associated
characteristics
once
the
deinitions
are
established
we
look
at
the
operationalization
of
these
notions
to
build
trustworthy
fair
accountable
transparent
and
ethical
ir
system
next
we
move
on
to
the
evaluation
of
fate
notions
that
help
to
compare
the
diferent
approaches
proposed
to
create
trustworthy
system
finally
the
conclusions
reached
in
diferent
studies
and
workshops
to
gain
better
understanding
of
the
ield
from
both
technical
and
societal
point
of
view
consequently
the
following
research
questions
are
identiied
for
the
systematic
review
rq1
what
are
the
deinitions
and
characteristics
of
fairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
in
ir
rq2
how
to
build
fair
accountable
transparent
and
ethical
ir
system
rq3
how
are
fate
notions
evaluated
rq4
what
conclusions
emerge
from
foundational
and
empirical
studies
as
well
as
from
discussions
at
workshops
grounded
on
the
indings
of
the
review
we
develop
taxonomies
based
on
the
diferent
dimensions
and
sub-dimensions
identiied
for
each
fate
notion
along
with
remaining
open

we
select
four

for
the
purpose
of
this

we
consider
that
the
majority
of
the

related
to
the

is
indexed
in
these

our

including
the

and
more
globally

some

might
be
of

for
this

we
focus
on
peer-reviewed

that
assume
some
external

assurance
therefore
sources
like
google

that
allow
the

were
not
considered
to
conduct
the

generally
it
can
be
assumed
that
the
highest

are
covered
by
the

we

before

the

very

we
see
signiicant
rise
in
the
number
of

which
illustrates
the
recent
attention
received
by
the
ield
we
note
that
this
peak
is
consistent
with
the
development
of
machine
learning
approaches
in
ir
including
among
others
the
introduction
of
the
transformers
model
in
2017
98
these
approaches
are
generally
considered
as
black
boxes
that
might
have
undesired
or
harmful
behavior
amplifying
biases
22
thus
it
appears
that
the
scientiic
community
is
looking
into
gaining
insights
to
better
understand
of
the
inner
workings
of
these
models
and
to
correct
their
undesired

it
is
noteworthy
that

did

we

fairness

as
starting
point
we
look
up
the
standard

of

notion
to
give
us
an
idea
of
what
user
might
expect
fairness
lthe

is
reasonable
accountability
lthe

the
study
by
hajibayova
45
is
the
only
one
that
provides
deinition
for
three
notions
fairness
accountability
and
transparency
interestingly
hajibayova
45
shifts
from
the
traditional
perspective
that
system
should
be
neutral
to
human
perspective
and
argues
that
it
reinforces
the
ethical
norms
and
standards
in
the
information
environment
accountability
is
deined
as
the
ability
to
justify
why
an
information
is
retrievable
and
accessible
or
not
with
mention
to
the
related
standards
policies
or
regulations
fairness
in
that
case
is
associated
with
the
idea
that
both
free
and
copyrighted
information
should
be
retrievable
and
accessible
but
be
used
responsibly
transparency
is
deined
as
the
ability
of
system
to
provide
and
maintain
an
understandable
viewsðfor
all
stakeholdersðof
its
standards
policies
and
the
provenance
of
the
information
two
other
studies
16

deine
notions
in
the
context
of

both
studies
state
that
there
are
several
competing
deinitions
of
fairness
consistent
with
the
elusiveness
of
this
concept
in
the
machine
learning
and
data
mining
communities
fairness
is
commonly
associated
with
the
absence
of
discrimination
sometimes
referred
to
as
bias
statistical
discrimination
due
to
diferent
factors
can
be

while
pitoura

on

castillo

concludes
that
fair
ranking
has
at
least
three
characteristics
ensure
individual
fairness
consistent
treatment
of
similar

prevent
representational
harms
towards
group
using
proper
representation
of

prevent
distributive
allocative
harms
towards

using
an
adequate
number
of

in
the
ranking
for
each

here
we
ind
that
two
types
of
fairness
emerge
individual
and
group
fairness
depending
on
the
granularity
level
of
the
work
those
are
also
reported
by

who
go
further
and
reine
the

by

fairness

castillo

why
having

important

claims
about
the

to
summarize
we
observe
that
the
deinition
of
accountability
is
close
to
the
standard
dictionary
deinition
however
for
transparency
and
fairness
the
standard
deinitions
are
found
to
be
too
vague
from
technical
point
of
view
therefore
various
studies
have
presented
reinements
that
are
still
in
line
with
the
spirit
of
the
standard
deinitions
the
notion
of

relates
to

characteristic
indeed
the

return
either

hence
having
an
approach
that
takes
this
structure
as
input
makes
it
easier
to
generalize
next
we
share
insights
on
approaches
to
build
fair
or
transparent
system
building
fair
ir
system
as
reported
in
the
previous
section
fairness
has
multiple
deinitions
based
on
diferent
characteristics
thus
here
we
analyze
the
proposed
approaches
with
regards
to
the
characteristics
that
are
taken
into
consideration
for
the
creation
of
fair
ir
system
first
we
see
that
all
the
studies
focus
on
the
group
level
rather
than
the
individual
one
group
fairness
is
particularly
studied
when
the
retrievable
items
are
people
18
32
94
moreover
the
presented
approaches
examine
fairness
on
single
output
except
for
96
where
sequence
of
outputs
is
examined
thus
the
aim
is
to
have
system
that
is
fair
on
average
with
the
possibility
that
some
outputs
are
unfair
another
observation
is
the
dominance
of
item-side
fairness
over
user-side
according
to
wang
and
joachims
103
both
sides
should
be
studied
in
online
platforms
because
system
should
treat
fairly
users
in
terms
of
services
as
well
as
items
in
terms
of
exposure
hence
they
propose
an
algorithm
to
optimize
consumer
and
producer
fairness
at
the
same
time
several
approaches
formalize
the
problem
of
creating
fair
system
as
an
optimization
problem
in
other
words
fairness
is
considered
as
constraint
17
111
and
the
goal
is
to
ind
an
output
with
the
highest
utility
and
fairness
building
transparent
ir
system
as
stated
before
explanations
are
means
to
achieve
transparency
there
are
two
important
characteristics
for
an
explanation
the
level
it
describes
and
the
presentation
form
used
for
communication
with
stakeholders
for
the
former
we
observe
that
the
majority
of
approaches
provide
local
explanations
which
help
user
to
understand
why
the
system
returns
speciic
results
for
example
singh
and
anand
89
provide
an
explanation
for
each
document
in
the
search
results
list
to
understand
why
the
document
is
relevant
given
the
terms
it
contains
in
another
example
muramatsu
and
pratt
73
show
the
fig
code
occurrences
in
approach
studies
transformations
applied
to
the
query
for
retrieval
which
can
help
users
understand
the
output
produced
and
reine
their
queries
nevertheless
we
also
identify
two
other
explanation
levels
that
provide
diferent
kinds
of
insights
into
the
inner
workings
of
systems
belkin
works
in
conversational
setting
where
the
purpose
of
explanations
is
to
provide
insights
on
the
abilities
of
the
system
and
strategy
to
answer
information
need
an
approach
based
on
the
concept
of
causality
is
presented
in
68
69
where
both
the
inner-workings
of
the
system
and
the
output
to
speciic
query
are
considered
the
presentation
of
explanations
often
depends
on
the
domain
of
application
and
the
user
interface
indeed
in
conversational
context
one
could
favor
textual
explanations
like
belkin
while
for
search
engines
the
user
interface
ofers
more
possibilities
for
rich
visual
representations
in
fact
visual
explanations
are
the
most
commonly
used
presentation
form
35
57
followed
by
structured
representation
101
and
approaches
that
mix
diferent
presentation
forms
51
110
within
approach
studies
only
one
work
100
does
not
use
explanations
to
create
transparent
ir
system
vilares
et
al
100
state
that
their
system
is
more
transparent
than
the
original
one
proposed
in
67
because
it
is
created
with
freely
available
resources
the
advantage
of
using
open-source
resources
allows
every
user
to
access
and
scrutinize
the
inner-workings
of
the
system
this
however
is
new
interpretation
of
transparency
unlike
the
other
systems
proposed
the
transparency
is
achieved
lexternally
through
the
documentation
and
openness
of
the
system
rather
than
linternally
with
the
production
of
explanations
in
summary
none
of
the
approach
studies
proposes
solution
to
create
system
that
is
fair
transparent
accountable
and
ethical
at
the
same
time

emerge
according
to
the
research
trends
during
the
studied
period
the
predominant
approach
to

is
post-process

approach
that
focuses
on

how
are
fate
notions
evaluated
next
we
look
into
how
the
diferent
notions
of
fate
are
evaluated
we
start
by
checking
how
studies
in
the
approach
category
assessed
the
proposed
methods
with
regards
to
the
fate
notions
that
are
being
addressed
table
lists
the
domains
of
evaluation
with
example
datasets
for
each
then
we
analyze
evaluation
studies
to
review
metrics
and
methods
used
finally
we
investigate
audit
user
study
papers
which
represent
common
ways
of
assessing
speciic
system
with
regards
to
fate
evaluation
in
approach
studies
we
ind
that
the
majority
74
of
approaches
proposed
to
build
fair
or
transparent
system
come
with
an
evaluation
with
regards
to
fairness
or
transparency
furthermore
the
following
pattern
is
observed
approaches
focusing
on
transparency
tend
to
be
evaluated
with
user
studies
while
the
ones
related
to
fairness
are
assessed
in
terms
of
system
performance
see
figure
moreover
we
note
that
in
50
of
the
studies
that
involve
performance-based
evaluation
new
metric
was
introduced
for
example
verma
and
ganguly
99
used
two
metrics
to
assess
the
consistency
and
correctness
of
an
explanation
table
shows
the
various
application
domains
that
have
been
studied
illustrating
the
omnipresence
of
information
retrieval
systems
in
society
various
tracks
at
the
text
retrieval
conference
trec
which
is
an
annual
benchmarking
platform
organized
by
the
us
national
institute
of
standards
and
technology
nist
are
one
of
the
main
source
of
the
datasets
used
by
approach
studies
for
evaluation
evaluation
methods
and
metrics
of
the
13
evaluation
studies
all
but
two
of
them
99
relate
to
the
notion
of
fairness
indeed
verma
and
ganguly
99
introduce
metric
to
evaluate
the
consistency
of
an
explanation
and
another
one
for
its
correctness
an
explanation
is
considered
consistent
if
variation
of
the
explanation
model
parameters
does
not
signiicantly
afect
it
the
correctness
of
an
explanation
corresponds
to
higher
weights
given
to
relevant
terms
in
the
query
abu-rasheed
et

evaluate
an

algorithm
with
four
metrics
fig
evaluation
methodologies
in
approach
studies
among
which
one
is

information

this
metric
assesses
the
quality
of
an
explanation
based
on
the
number
of
slots
that
are
illed
in
an
explanation
template
the
more
slots
that
are
illed
the
better
the
explanation
some
studies
propose
comparison
of
diferent

38
fairness
metrics
54
and
diversiication

66
in
the
context
of
fairness
as
an
optimization
problem
gao
and
shah
38
introduce
framework
to
identify
solution
space
for
speciic
dataset
this
space
is
then
used
to
compare
diferent
optimization
policies
to
ind
the
optimal
one
other
studies
that
introduce
new
metrics
in
order
to
quantify
estimate
fairness
usually
do
it
with
proxy
for
example
gao
and
shah
39
measure
bias
while
diaz
et
al
26
use
the
concept
of
exposure
diferent
perspective
is
proposed
by
gao
et
al
37
by
integrating
both
traditional
ir
metrics
used
for
relevance
assessment
with
fairness
metrics
the
fact
that
fairness
has
many
deinitions
leads
to
variety
of
metrics
kuhlman
et
al
54
highlight
three
categories
top-k
exposure
and
pairwise
metrics
top-k
metrics
like
normalized
discounted
diference
rnd
and
normalized
discounted
ratio
rrd
are
based
on
the
idea
that
an
item
has
good
outcome
if
it
is
ranked
in
the
top-k
positions
exposure
metrics
focus
on
the
attention
given
to
an
item
at
speciic
rank
position
finally
pairwise
metrics
evaluate
the
advantage
of
group
compared
to
another
one
this
variety
can
explain
why
we
did
not
identify
sort
of
reference
metric
to
easily
compare
approaches
in
way
that
mean
average
precision
map
is
commonly
used
to
compare
the
quality
of
diferent
approaches
audits
and
user
studies
the
notion
of
accountability
is
generally
examined
through
audits
as
in
59
77
other
notions
such
as
fairness
and
transparency
are
usually
investigated
through
user
studies
the
work
by
kuhlman
et
al
55
is
the
only
one
that
proposes
an
audit
framework
for
fairness
since
there
is
no
established
standard
solution
for
user
studies
it
is
extremely
diicult
to
generalize
them
for
example
in
audit
user
study
papers
the
number
of
participants
varies
between
14
73
and
079
92
we
make
similar
observation
for
the
number
of
questions
asked
in
surveys
exit
interviews
which
ranges
between
95
and
21
25
additionally
there
are
multiple
options
for
study
design
within-subject
70
or
between-subject
84
the
types
of
questions
asked
from
participants
are
also
diverse
there
are
likert
scale
questions
like
lby
looking
at
the
snippet
can
tell
if
the
result
is
useful
or
not
without
opening
the
link
70
as
well
as
more
open-ended
questions
such
as
ltry
to
explain
as
simply
as
possible
how
this
matching
rate
number
is
calculated
86
finally
the
demography
of
the
participants
is
usually
unique
to
the
speciic
study
in
terms
of
gender
parity
age
range
occupation
etc
nevertheless
we
notice
that
the
participants
in
the
selected
studies
are
most
commonly
based
born
in
the
united
states
to
conclude
our
indings
on
the
evaluation
of
fate
in
ir
we
notice
that
variety
of
metrics
are
available
to
assess
fairness
which
is
likely
due
to
the
many
deinitions
of
fairness
this
fact
can
also
be
linked
to
the
observation
that
metrics
commonly
use
proxy
to
fairness
interestingly
we
note
that
only
one
study
considers
individual
fairness
26
regarding
the
examination
of
accountability
in
system
audits
appear
to
be
the
only
solution
based
on
observations
from
series
of
experiments
discussion
emerges
on
who
should
be
responsible
for
the
actions
of
the
system
finally
in
terms
of
transparency
the
common
approach
is
to
conduct
user
studies
in
order
to
assess
users
understanding
of
the
system
however
metrics
were
proposed
in
99
which
do
not
evaluate
transparency
directly
but
use
explanation
quality
as
proxy

what
conclusions
emerge
from
foundational
and
empirical
studies
as
well
as
from
discussions
at
workshops
after
investigating
approaches
to
build
trustworthy
ir
systems
and
methods
and
metrics
to
evaluate
fate
notions
we
relect
on
the
conclusions
reached
in
diferent
types
of
studies
approach
evaluation
foundational
and
workshop
tutorial
we
report
the
indings
organized
around
the
notion
in
focus
fairness
as
stated
in
the
previous
sections
fairness
is
multi-dimensional
concept
that
does
not
have
one-size-its-all
deinition
it
is
noteworthy
that
some
tensions
can
be
observed
between
diferent
deinitions
75
let
us
take
individual
and
group
fairness
as
an
example
where
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
optimizing
one
will
not
optimize
the
other
the
lack
of
shared
deinition
is
real
challenge
to
the
development
of
standardized
solutions
and
evaluation
metrics
additional
open
challenges
such
as
the
lack
of
data
are
reported
in
75
82
previously
we
observed
that
fairness
is
commonly
studied
through
proxies
such
as
diversity
exposure
and
bias
however
an
important
point
is
that
these
proxies
are
not
equivalent
to
fairness
in
other
words
having
diverse
or
unbiased
output
does
not
always
imply
that
the
system
is
fair
pathiyan
cherumanal
et
al
79
observe
that
some
metrics
capture
novelty
and
diversity
but
not
on
the
same
dimensions
sühr
et
al
92
provide
another
perspective
on
the
relationship
between
diverse
results
and
fairness
the
authors
state
that
system
can
be
diverse
and
improve
group
fairness
by
increasing
the
selection
of
items
from
underrepresented
groups
but
the
fairness
aspect
entirely
depends
on
the
end
user
this
is
illustrated
by
an
example
in
the
human
resources
domain
if
the
end
userða
recruiter
in
this
situationðis
biased
towards
gender
or
race
then
the
overall
output
will
not
be
fair
olteanu
et
al
75
provide
the
following
key
requirements
and
questions
that
should
be
considered
when
creating
fair
ir
system
create
rankings
based
on
fairer
algorithms
and
the
knowledge
of
possible
query
dependent
protected
attributes
what
fairness
constraint
should
be
optimized
to
consider
both
the
user
and
the
item
sides
where
and
when
should
we
intervene
in
the
ir
system
pipeline
and
how
to
take
limited
training
data
with
respect
to
sensitive
attributes
into
consideration
have
fair
user
interface
that
may
need
to
ind
compromise
between
fairness
and
transparency
recognize
potential
trade-ofs
between
exploration
and
exploitation
transparency
we
observe
that
transparency
can
have
several
levels
and
purposes
interpretability
rein
forcement
of
trust
as
consequence
diferent
models
have
been
developed
at
the
same
time
the
formalization
of
transparency
is
still
an
open
problem
75
ribes
et
al
86
argue
that
the
manner
of
presenting
detailed
explanation
can
in
some
cases
result
in
the
overloading
of
the
cognitive
capacities
of
the
user
and
reduce
the
interpretability
of
the
system
however
if
the
communication
is
done
in
reasonable
manner
the
user
experience
is
improved
25
another
solution
to
make
system
transparent
without
deteriorating
the
user
experience
is
by
publishing
articles
or
blog
posts
about
the
inner-workings
of
the
system
33
34
59
so
that
the
information
is
available
to
all
users
who
want
to
know
more
about
the
system
similarly
to
the
case
of
fairness
discussed
above
olteanu
et
al
75
provide
series
of
essential
questions
to
address
when
creating
transparent
ir
system
the
vast
majority
of
studies
argue
and
strive
for
increased
transparency
25
73
75
89
unlike
those
laidlaw
56
calls
for
precautions
as
fully-transparent
system
might
invite
some
ill-intentioned
users
to
take
advantage
of
it
laidlaw
56
gives
the
example
of
search
engine
optimization
tools
which
aim
to
increase
the
traic
of
website
by
manipulating
search
engine
rankings
indeed
with
total
transparency
these
tools
would
have
all
necessary
information
to
dupe
the
ranking
algorithm
into
considering
irrelevant
items
as
relevant
accountability
studies
related
to
the
notion
of
accountability
usually
try
to
answer
some
of
the
following
questions
who
is
responsible
for
the
production
of
fair
output
does
the
system
follow
some
regulations
standards
or
policies
is
there
an
independent
complaints
mechanism
laidlaw
56
argues
that
search
engines
do
not
belong
to
existing
media
categories
such
as
newspapers
hence
they
do
not
need
to
comply
with
any
sort
of
regulations
moreover
the
author
states
that
imposing
some
standards
policy
or
anything
making
the
search
engine
responsible
might
slow
down
innovation
due
to
new
constraints
they
identify
four
priorities
for
accountability
including
the
production
of
relevant
and
unbiased
output
and
certain

takes
the
special
case
of
the
google
search
engine
and
focuses
on
its
responsibility
to
produce
fair
results
one
of
the
points
raised
is
that
the
search
engine
and
the
way
the
output
is
processed
by
the
users
are
the
result
of
human
decisions
which
can
lead
to
unfairness
this
is
also
supported
by

hence
one
could
wonder
if
the
responsibility
falls
on
the
end

on

can
be

discussion
based
on
what
we
learned
through
the
systematic
literature
review
we
now
present
our
insights
on
trustworthy
ir
systems
first
we
discuss
about
the
formalization
of
the
fate
notions
through
taxonomies
as
well
as
the
problems
related
to
them
then
in
section
5.2
we
present
some
open
challenges
in
the
ield
finally
we
conclude
our
discussion
in
section
5.3
by
acknowledging
limitations
of
this
study
5.1
taxonomies
of
fairness
accountability
and
transparency
requirements
throughout
this
review
we
observed
that
the
diferent
notionsðfairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethicsðdo
not
have
clear
deinitions
which
makes
it
diicult
to
formalize
them
and
consequently
to
develop
standard
solutions
fairness
appears
to
be
the
notion
with
the
most
number
of
dimensions
speciied
good
and
detailed
taxonomy
for
it
was
introduced
by
pitoura
et
al
82
however
we
did
not
ind
similar
work
for
the
other
notions
therefore
we
develop
taxonomies
by
specifying
dimensions
and
sub-dimensions
for
accountability
and
transparency
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
our
taxonomies
focus
only
on
the
characterization
of
the
notions
of
fairness
accountability
and
transparency
the
requirements
for
an
ir
system
to
be
fair
transparent
or
accountable
there
are
additional
categories
we
identiied
during
the
coding
process
such
as
position
in
the
ir
process
and
type
in
table
which
can
be
used
to
characterize
ways
to
make
ir
systems
more
fair
accountable
and
transparent
contribute
to
taxonomy
of
methods
we
believe
that
using
these
taxonomies
to
characterize
the
diferent
notions
will
help
to
identify
common
trends
and
research
gaps
in
addition
to
relevant
work
when
performing
comparative
analysis
for
accountability
we
propose
three
main
dimensions
listed
in
table
the
irst
one
describes
the
types
of
rules
the
system
follows
such
as
regulations
and
policies
the
second
dimension
identiies
if
an
independent
complaint
mechanism
is
available
the
information
commissioner
oice10
in
united
kingdom
finally
the
last
dimension
focuses
on
who
is
responsible
for
the
system
actionsðit
could
be
the
user
algorithm
or
designer
in
practice
the
information
regarding
the
fulillment
of
these
dimensions
can
usually
be
found
in
the
lpolicies
and
lterms
and
conditions
documents
of
ir
systems
for
example
search
engines
commonly
have
privacy
policy
with
section
related
to
european
users
and
the
compliance
with
gdpr
see
the
following
statement
in
privacy
policy
of
semantic
scholar
11
lwhere
personal
information
is
transferred
from
the
european
economic
area
leea
or
switzerland
we
rely
on
appropriate
safeguards
such
as
the
european
commission-approved
standard
contractual
clauses
and
privacy
shield
frameworks
to
transfer
the
data
and
or
as
otherwise
authorized
by
applicable
law
the
responsible
dimension
is
commonly
addressed
in
liability
section
however
we
note
here
that
in
some
cases
responsibility
is
waived
by
the
ir
system
without
explicitly
designating
responsible
party
for
example

web

of
the
national
library
of
medicine

which
maintains
pubmed

and
life
sciences

any
legal
liability
or

for
the
accuracy
completeness
or

of
any

or

observe
that
it
is

and

document

with
ir
systems
presented
at
academic

one
of
the
main
reason
being
their
limited

presented

2018
and
2021

be
accessed
anymore
similarly
we
introduce
taxonomy
for
transparency
in
table
we
distinguish
three
main
dimensions
divided
in
reined
sub-dimensions
the
irst
one
corresponds
to
the
degree
of
transparency
of
system
the
system
can
be
totally
or
partially
transparent
the
second
sub-dimension
can
be
used
to
limit
the
risk
of
malicious
usage
or
to
protect
business
technology
the
second
dimension
relates
to
the
level
at
which
the
transparency
can
be
observed
the
system
its
output
or
the
relationship
between
both
can
be
transparent
the
last
dimension
concerns
the
modality
used
to
communicate
the
information
related
to
transparency
based
on
the
results
of
this
review
we
identify
three
modalities
ui
articles
and
open
resources
studies
presented
in
this
survey
illustrate
several
possible
ways
to
implement
these
dimensions
for
example
the
transparent
queries
system
73
is
partially
transparent
on
local
level
as
for
each
query
only
its
pre-processing
is
visually
explained
through
the
user
interface
while
vilares
et
al
100
satisfy
diferent
sub-dimensions
as
they
create
an
ir
system
with
open
source
resources
terrier13
hence
the
information
to
make
the
system
fully
transparent
at
global
level
is
available
in
the
code
and
documentation
of
those
resources
the
notion
of
ethics
is
considered
an
outlier
in
sense
that
it
is
hardly
discussed
in
the
studies
selected
for
this
review
less
than
10
of
the
studies
focus
on
ethics
in
our
opinion
the
fact
that
it
is
not
discussed
speciic
to
ir
suggests
two
possibilities
either
the
question
of
ethics
is
not
speciic
to
ir
but
applies
more
generally
to
ai
indeed
there
are
surveys
of
ethical
guidelines
for
ai
44
50
as
well
as
work
on
the
ethical
design
of
ai
systems
14
it
could
also
be
that
ethics
has
ir-speciic
aspects
but
the
current
focus
is
on
the
other
notions
of
fate
which
are
easier
to
characterize
but
challenging
nevertheless
consequently
it
might
take
some
more
time
before
ethics
in
ir
receives
suicient
attention
either
way
existing
studies
suggest
that
the
various
ethical

considerations
such
as
conidentiality
and
safety
75
are
each
complex
enough
to
deserve
their
own
taxonomy
to
be
developed
this
however
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
work
5.2
open
challenges
from
our
observations
it
appears
that
there
are
still
many
open
challenges
in
the
ield
few
of
them
are
listed
below
on
high-level
we
identify
two
main
direction
of
work
the
irst
one
is
the
deinition
and
formalization
of
the
problems
as
discussed
in
the
previous
sections
secondly
an
important
challenge
is
the
evaluation
of
each
notion
and
more
particularly
the
development
of
standardized
evaluation
protocols
and
metrics
individual
fairness
in
this
review
only
one
of
the
selected
studies
26
reports
on
individual
fairness
while
there
is
lot
of
work
on
group
fairness
as
stated
before
individual
fairness
aims
to
ensure
consistent
treatment
of
similar
items
or
users
our
review
did
not
yield
clear
explanation
as
to
why
individual
fairness
did
not
receive
the
same
attention
as
group
fairness
this
is
all
the
more
interesting
because
according
to
biega
et
al
12
these
two
are
related
in
fact
the
authors
state
lwhen
equity
of
attention
is
achieved
for
individuals
it
will
also
be
achieved
at
the
group
level
other
work
36
114
present
some
conlicts
that
can
occur
between
diferent
kinds
fairness
hence
we
believe
that
better
treatment
of
individual
fairness
in
the
literature
would
contribute
to
study
potential
trade-ofs
with
group
fairness
and
provide
better
guidelines
for
the
development
of
future
ir
systems
regulations
the
question
about
the
regulation
of
ir
system
remains
open
despite
the
widespread
deployment
of
ir
systems
for
several
decades
now
countries
tend
to
have
diferent
standards
while
ir
systems
are
used
internationally
thus
one
can
wonder
if
general
agreement
can
be
reached
an
example
is
the
policies
on
data
privacy
in
europe
there
is
the
gdpr
while
another
one
is
applied
in
california
california
consumer
privacy
act
however
the
operationalization
of
some
aspects
of
these
regulations
remains
challenging
and
unclear
to
date
20
for
instance
there
are
obstacles
related
to
the
operationalization
of
data
minimization
article
in
gdpr
especially
the
lack
of
guidelines
with
practical
deinition
and
information
on
when
and
how
data
minimization
should
be
applied
as
pointed
out
by
biega
10
in
their
talk
given
at
the
13th
european
summer
school
in
information
retrieval
essir
22
therefore
we
believe
that
interdisciplinary
communication
is
essential
to
develop
regulations
that
are
socially
accepted
and
technically
realistic
ethics
in
this
review
we
observe
that
the
notion
of
ethics
is
sparsely
studied
compared
to
other
notions
speciic
reason
for
this
could
not
be
deducted
from
our
review
however
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
ethics
is
broad
term
that
comprises
several
sub-notions
such
as
privacy
and
safety
thus
its
formalization
in
the
context
of
information
retrieval
is
non-trivial
therefore
we
believe
that
study
of
each
sub-notion
under
ethics
as
irst
step
would
help
the
research
community
to
have
better
understanding
of
what
is
at
stake
when
talking
about
ethics
then
the
indings
should
enable
to
make
progress
in
the
long
term
benchmarks
the
evaluation
of
ir
systems
against
public
benchmarks
is
more
than
common
practice
it
is
the
very
trademark
of
the
ield
102
in
the
last
few
years
some
benchmarks
addressing
the
notion
of
fairness
have
been
initiated
for
example
the
trec
fair
ranking
track14
has
started
in
2019
and
is
running
annually
since
in
2019
the
track
targeted
group
fairness
on
the
producer
side
and
multiple
outputs
11
the
tasks
addressed
by
the
track
evolve
every
year
therefore
the
targeted
sub
dimensions
can
change
accordingly
most
recently
the
ntcir
fair
web
task15
has
been
introduced
in
2022
this
web
search
task
focuses
on
item
group
fairness
in
single
output
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
there
are
no
benchmarks
for
the
other
notions
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
the
creation
of
benchmark
for
accountability
is
especially
challenging
as
evaluation
metrics
do
not
exist
for
it
yet
as

fairweb1
stated
before
the
case
of
ethics
is
even
more
challenging
as
the
various
ethical
considerations
would
need
to
be
formally
characterized
irst
overall
the
development
benchmarks
corresponding
to
each
fate
notion
would
be
critical
enabler
of
progress
moreover
such
benchmarks
would
allow
for
standardized
comparisons
between
information
retrieval
systems
as
ir
systems
are
more
and
more
used
to
automate
tasks
that
have
direct
impact
on
people
lives
such
as
candidate
ranking
and
news
retrieval
one
question
we
ask
ourselves
after
this
literature
review
is
is
it
possible
to
combine
all
the
work
on
the
diferent
notions
to
create
system
that
is
fair
transparent
accountable
and
ethical
all
at
the
same
time
if
not
what
are
the
trade-ofs
and
who
should
be
deciding
which
notion
to
favor
over
the
others
for
example
when
looking
for
job
one
does
not
want
to
be
ranked
lower
in
the
pool
of
competent
candidates
because
of
protected
attributes
gender
nationality
and
the
recruiter
might
want
to
know
how
the
pool
of
candidates
is
created
to
identify
potential
biases
and
report
them
to
the
correct
entity
the
designer
of
the
system
however
this
is
only
valid
when
protected
attributes
are
known
via
the
candidate
application
indeed
if
such
attributes
are
not
speciied
or
deliberately
withhold
the
information
retrieval
system
cannot
be
blamed
tension
could
also
arise
between
transparency
and
ethics
more
particularly
conidentiality
indeed
in
order
to
be
transparent
the
system
needs
to
reveal
information
however
it
is
important
not
to
leak
conidential
information
take
the
example
of
information
retrieval
in
the
medical
domain
where
the
explanation
of
ranking
may
contain
the
patient
personal
data
that
should
not
be
shared
with
everyone
5.3
limitations
the
aim
of
this
systematic
review
was
to
provide
comprehensive
overview
of
what
has
been
done
in
the
ield
of
fate
in
ir
since
1980
based
on
large
selection
of
studies
it
could
be
argued
that
the
annotation
of
the
studies
is
subjective
and
biased
indeed
it
is
possible
that
the
study
selection
and
classiication
would
have
been
diferent
if
done
by
another
researcher
however
the
candidate
set
of
papers
and
their
annotations
are
made
publicly
available
to
support
reproducibility
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
review
does
not
cover
all
available
studies
in
the
ield
caused
by
the
methodical
procedure
of
gathering
research
from
limited
number
of
sources
an
example
is
the
work
by
zimmer
117
that
is
not
indexed
in
the
selected
sources
however
we
chose
the
source
databases
based
on
their
domain
and
the
number
of
papers
indexed
in
order
to
provide
high
level
of
coverage
of
relevant
studies
despite
this
the
methodical
approach
for
this
review
ofers
the
possibility
to
be
extended
in
future
works
using
other
sources
and
or
time
range
it
is
also
possible
that
the
search
terms
do
not
appear
in
the
title

an

is

by

that
does
not

or

in
its
title
or
abstract
this
work
is
based
on
an
arguably
narrow
deinition
of
ir
systems
rank
items
in
response
to
textual
query
broad
deinition
of
modern
ir
system
is
to
provide
the
lright
information
in
the
right
way
at
the
right
time
still
our
indings
show
that
even
with
narrow
deinition
the
subject
is
complex
and
many
challenges
remain
therefore
the
generalization
to
an
extended
deinition
of
ir
systems
is
left
for
future
work
this
especially
includes
contemporary
ir
systems
relying
on
users
personal
activities
to
enhance
their
performance
and
deliver
tailored
results
conclusion
the
ield
of
challenges
of
fairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
in
information
retrieval
has
attracted
lot
of
attention
lately
this
can
be
explained
by
the
omnipresence
of
ir
systems
in
the
society
as
well
as
the
wish
to
automatize
data-intensive
tasks
in
order
to
answer
speciic
requests
retrieving
news
ranking
job
candidates
to
be
well
accepted
these
systems
should
comply
to
ethical
norms
such
as
being
fair
transparent
and
respect
users
privacy
this
is
not
always
easy
to
achieve
especially
with
systems
based
on
machine
learning
models
which
are
often
considered
as
black
boxes
therefore
systematic
literature
review
was
performed
to
give
an
overview
of
the
ield
more
speciically
this
review
analysed
75
studies
focusing
on
the
following
points
the
deinitions
of
fairness
accountability
transparency
and
ethics
the
solutions
proposed
to
build
fair
accountable
transparent
and
ethical
ir
system
the
evaluation
methodologies
used
to
assess
the
solutions
proposed
the
conclusions
emerging
from
foundational
and
empirical
studies
as
well
as
from
discussions
at
workshops
from
this
review
we
learned
that
the
deinitions
of
the
diferent
notions
are
complex
due
to
their
multi-dimensional
nature
which
makes
it
challenging
to
establish
shared
standards
following
the
principles
of
grounded
theory
we
found
that
there
is
no
work
combining
all
of
the
notions
together
however
we
established
that
the
proposed
approaches
can
intervene
at
diferent
stages
of
the
information
retrieval
process
and
can
be
model
speciic
or
not
the
trends
suggest
preferred
approaches
to
build
fair
or
transparent
ir
system
these
are
post-process
and
model
agnostic
approaches
that
study
group
fairness
in
single
ranking
or
provide
visual
and
local
explanations
respectively
with
regards
to
evaluation
there
are
variety
of
metrics
to
automatically
assess
fairness
this
is
likely
due
to
the
diferent
possible
deinitions
of
fairness
while
the
evaluation
of
accountability
and
transparency
is
commonly
performed
with
diferent
methodologies
such
as
audits
and
user
studies
finally
the
conclusions
reached
by
diferent
studies
provide
some
perspectives
regarding
the
creation
of
ethical
ir
systems
more
particularly
some
tensions
between
diferent
notions
and
proxies
associated
to
them
were
found
in
addition
gap
between
beliefs
of
the
designers
engineers
and
users
of
ir
systems
was
identiied
taxonomy
of
fairness
was
previously
proposed
82
however
similar
taxonomies
for
the
other
notions
of
fate
were
not
found
in
this
review
therefore
we
contributed
to
illing
this
gap
by
introducing
taxonomies
for
transparency
and
accountability
based
on
sub
dimensions
identiied
during
the
review
the
development
of
taxonomy
for
ethics
is
left
for
future
work
due
to
the
low
representation
of
ethics
in
the
selected
studies
we
hope
that
this
is
step
towards
better
understanding
of
these
notions
formalization
of
the
problems
encountered
in
the
ield
and
the
development
of
standards
we
strongly
believe
that
collaboration
between
researchers
from
diferent
ields
such
as
legal
studies
sociology
and
information
retrieval
to
reine
and
extend
these
dimensions
would
be
beneicial
based
on
the
open
challenges
identiied
from
the
literature
review
we
highlight
few
points
related
to
fate
that
should
be
considered
for
the
development
and
deployment
of
future
ir
systems
first
it
is
important
to
clearly
deine
the
notion
studied
this
is
especially
true
for
fairness
as
many
deinitions
exist
and
certain
deinitions
may
not
align
or
be
compatible
with
others
furthermore
the
diferent
trade-ofs
considered
between
the
notions
and
or
the
performance
should
be
made
clear
so
the
end-users
and
experts
can
better
understand
the
system
results
and
behavior
second
the
development
of
new
evaluation
methodologies
and
metrics
for
the
diferent
notions
should
help
to
prevent
harmful
behavior
before
the
deployment
of
the
ir
system
third
the
regulations
of
ir
systems
with
regards
to
fate
notions
could
be
review
by
team
multi-disciplinary
experts
in
order
to
be
more
precise
in
accordance
with
society
beliefs
and
technically
realistic
