introduction
personalized
algorithmic
systems
are
being
increasingly
deployed
in
broad
range
of
sectors
these
algorithms
hold
the
potential
to
provide
more
appropriate
outputs
on
an
individual
basis
by
personalizing
based
on
preferences
values
needs
or
environmental
conditions
most
prominently
recommender
systems
are
now
widely
used
to
provide
the
most
useful
recommendations
to
each
individual
in
the
given
domain
at
the
same
time
we
have
seen
signiﬁcant
increase
in
the
recognition
that
algorithms
can
exhibit
biases
and
produce
unfair
or
unjust
outcomes
there
are
many
diﬀerent
potential
sources
of
bias
in
algorithms
and
models
and
hence
many
diﬀerent
responses
may
be
appropriate
or
required
algorithm
development
and
deployment
eﬀorts
now
typically
recognize
the
possibility
of
algorithmic
bias
and
the
need
to
often
do
something
to
mitigate
it
we
contend
that
these
two
desiderata
for
algorithms
personalization
and
fairness
stand
in
signiﬁcant
tension
at
high
level
personalization
is
fundamentally
about
treating
each
individual
in
distinct
ways
the
goal
is
to
not
give
the
same
output
for
each
individual
but
rather
to
tailor
the
outputs
to
their
speciﬁc
situation
in
contrast
fairness
is
fundamentally
about
treating
individuals
similarly
the
algorithm
ought
to
be
the
same
in
some
sense
for
everyone
of
course
this
high-level
gloss
on
the
tension
is
far
too
quick
for
example
fairness
allows
for
diﬀerential
treatment
or
outcomes
as
long
as
it
is
based
on
morally
or
legally
defensible
grounds
nonetheless
these
high-level
observations
point
towards
tension
that
we
contend
continues
to
hold
when
we
look
deeper
more
speciﬁcally
we
analyze
fairness
in
the
context
of
personalized
systems
using
the
notion
of
epistemic
utility
essentially
the
beneﬁt
that
an
agent
receives
by
an
epistemic
improvement
reduction
in
uncertainty
and
provide
both
practical
and
policy
guidance
about
how
to
achieve
fair
personalized
systems

preliminaries
recommender
system
we
consider
recommender
system
as
that
which
uses
an
algorithmic
approach
to
provide
an
ordering
or
prioritization
for
items
based
on
relevance
to
user
this
form
of
personalization
is
often
based
on
their
preferences
past
behavior
or
similarities
with
other
users
with
the
overarching
goal
of
improving
user
experience
and
engagement
group
fairness
algorithmic
fairness
is
typically
framed
as
metric
parity1
across
two
or
more
relevantly
comparable
entities
such
that
the
diﬀerence
between
them
is
deemed
socially
legally
and
or
culturally
irrelevant
for
instance
group
fairness
may
be
deﬁned
as
demographic
parity
meaning
equality
in
the
likelihood
of
given
outcome
conditioned
on
the
group
gender
age
disability
formally
𝑦ˆ

𝑦ˆ
𝑔𝑖
where
is
the
total
number
of
groups
and
𝑦ˆ
is
the
likelihood
of
given
outcome
epistemic
utility
we
deﬁne
epistemic
utility
as
the
value
or
usefulness
of
information
in
terms
of
improving
knowledge
understanding
or
beliefs
it
encompasses
the
epistemic
beneﬁts
gained
from
acquiring
accurate
reliable
and
relevant
information
these
beneﬁts
could
of
course
enhance
decision-making
prediction
problem-solving
or
overall
intellectual
development
but
epistemic
utility
refers
only
to
the
beneﬁts
in
terms
of
the
agent
epistemic
state
even
if
those
improvements
do
not
immediately
lead
to
improved
outcomes
it
thereby
captures
the
intrinsic
value
of
acquiring
knowledge
and
understanding
it
underscores
the
role
of
information
as
valuable
resource
for
intellectual
growth
social
mobility
and
production
and
captures
the
motivational
value
of
information
for
people
behavior
related
work
this
work
is
most
closely
related
to
eﬀorts
to
understand
fairness
in

systems
many
of
which
deﬁne
fairness
as
parity
in
some
performance

across
some
sensitive
attribute

methods
for
individual
notions
of
fairness
similarly
require
domain-speciﬁc
similarity
function
and
focus
on
trade-oﬀs
between
individual
and
group
fairness
11
12
in
contrast
we
start
from
the
position
that
fairness
requires
equity
across
all
individuals
rather
than
being
deﬁned
solely
through
comparisons
this
approach
enables
us
to
account
for
cases
of
unfairness
where
everyone
is
worse
oﬀ
including
situations
with
non-comparative
injustices
not
only
those
in
which
one
group
is
more
speciﬁcally
prior
work
has
aimed
to
ensure
proportional
representation
and
exposure
often
in
e-commerce
settings

such
as
disparate

and

still
require

however
its

in

as

can
contribute
to

making
it
limited
to
applications
where
less

is
valued
by
users

additionally

concerns
about

in

is
connected
to

on

21
the
core
concern
in

is
that

may
impair

injustice
for
example
if
an
individual
does
not
have
the
concept
of
racial
discrimination
then
they
might
fail
to
detect
its
occurrence
despite
suﬀering
harms
from
it
that
is
the
injustice
is
not
only
about
what
happens
to
the
individual
but
also
about
their
epistemic
inability
to
recognize
understand
and
respond
to
it
personalized
systems
can
readily
lead
to
diﬀerent
individuals
having
diﬀerent
information
in
fact
that
is
one
goal
of
such
systems
and
so
we
expect
that
individuals
would
develop
diﬀerent
concepts
as
result
hence
personalized
systems
can
signiﬁcantly
raise
the
risks
of
epistemic
injustice
research
on
over-personalization
and
information
access
is
similarly
closely
related
while
the
inﬂuence
of
personalization
in
ﬁlter
bubbles
and
echo
chambers
has
been
denied
for
purely
technical
systems
22
23
24
when
considering
human
interactions
the
inﬂuence
becomes
somewhat
complex
this
is
in
part
due
to
signiﬁcant
variability
in
how
users
engage
with
site
accept
or
reject

perceive

core

personalization
and
standard
approaches
to
fairness
fairness
is
often
deﬁned
as
metric
parity
across
similar
groups
or
individuals
where
determining
similarity
across
units
remains
an
open
question
in
search
settings
one
might
start
by
grouping
together
individuals
with
similar
values
and
interests
as
on
fairness
grounds
they
may
be
expected
to
have
similar
disambiguation
or
content
recommendation
experience
however
determining
values
can
be
diﬃcult
to
operationalize
because
explicit
and
implicit
preferences
may
be
conﬂicting
or
diﬃcult
to
collect
30
in
addition
the
level
of
granularity
by
which
to
measure
such
values
remains
unknown
in
this
section
we
construct
arguments
for
why
user
similarity
of
values
is
diﬃcult
impractical
or
perhaps
even
impossible
to
determine
thereby
making
similarity-based
fairness
deﬁnitions
diﬃcult
to
deploy
or
conceptually
impossible
sensitive
attributes
are
problematic
and
coarse
proxies
for
values
the
simplest
approach
to
constructing
similar
groups
for
fairness
considerations
could
use
sensitive
attributes
race
ethnicity
gender
age
religious
aﬃliation
disability
etc
however
this
approach
assumes
that
individuals
with
the
same
sensitive
attributes
not
only
face
similar
struggles
lived
experiences
discrimination
and
prejudice
but
also
have
relevantly
similar
values
in
practice
this
approach
would
likely
result
in
the
treatment
of
minority
groups
as
monoliths
perhaps
even
as
homogeneous
other
this
is
problematic
not
only
in
its
instrumental
failures
of
insuﬃcient
speciﬁcity
and
complexity
but
also
in
its
intrinsic
treatment
of
single
sensitive
attribute
as
representative
of
all
values
additionally
conditional
groupings
only
ensure
parity
guarantees
for
the
average
member
of
group
not
for
each
individual
nor
necessarily
an
individual
that
exists
therefore
enabling
unfairness
for
anyone
that
doesn
satisfy
such
assumptions
taking
an
intersectional
approach
considering
subgroups
of
sensitive
attributes
may
better
approximate
similarity
of
values
consider
for
example
race
and
gender
meaning
groups
such
as
black
women
and
white
men
this
still
considers
an
entire
group
of
people
homogeneously
thereby
rendering
the
plight
of
for
example
all
black
women
into
singular
experience
in
the
extreme
considering
all
possible
sub-groups
across
all
sensitive
attributes
faces
practical
challenges
as
each
subgroup
becomes
impractically
small
for
data
availability
purposes
thereby
reifying
sensitive
attributes
in
constant
struggle
for
relative
popularity
and
public
consciousness
31

an
alternative

to

of

we
could
condition

history
unfortunately
this
approach
faces
three
open
challenges
which
we
highlight
in
the
context
of
search
though
the
problems
naturally
generalize
to
other
systems
that
use
observed
behavior
to
personalize
on
the
basis
of
unobserved
inferred
features
first
not
all
search
behaviors
are
equally
informative
for
example
search
query
may
be
made
due
to
diﬀerent
situational
demands
homework
third
party
question
or
may
arise
from
very
diﬀerent
motivations
devil
advocate
vs
searching
for
validative
or
supporting
arguments
hence
speciﬁc
history
of
search
queries
may
or
may
not
be
informative
about
an
individual
values
the
history
alone
is
not
suﬃcient
second
even
if
search
behaviors
are
genuine
they
are
noisy
indicators
for
the
totality
of
an
individual
interests
or
values
for
example
the
individual
agent
might
not
search
for
topic
they
already
have
suﬃcient
information
on
but
it
may
still
be
core
value
more
generally
consider
two
users
with
identical
search
histories
at
any
given
point
in
time
conditioning
on
search
history
would
imply
that
they
should
receive
similar
experiences
however
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
these
individuals
have
the
exact
same
sets
of
values
and
interests
that
is
multiple
sets
of
values
and
interests
could
be
consistent
with
the
observed
behavior
the
space
of
values
are
underdetermined
by
the
evidence
therefore
since
queries
subject
to
the
limitations
of
observational
data
and
missing
contextual
information
conditioning
on
search
history
alone
has
the
potential
to
greatly
under-specify
an
individual
values
finally
search
history
provides
no
guarantees
of
stability
over
time
consider
again
two
individuals
with
the
same
user
history
adding
diﬀerent
element
to
each
user
search
history
could
lead
them
to
be
placed
in
fundamentally
diﬀerent
groups
more
generally
at
any
point
in
time
there
are
inﬁnitely
many
ways
that
search
history
could
progress
thereby
making
it
impossible
to
guarantee
fairness
over
time
for
these
two
individuals
let
alone
all
fairness
groupings
not
sensitive
to
the
time
and
search
history
therefore
may
not
ever
converge
to
fair
groupings
in
the
limit
this
echoes
similar
problem
in
fairness
research
where
fairness
constraints
at
each
round
of
deployment
do
not
ensure
long-term
aggregate
parity
in
the
same
metric
32
while
this
has
not
rendered
particular
fairness
metrics
obsolete
this
instability
points
to
ambiguity
in
the
extent
to
which
fairness
must
provide

are

deemed
suﬃciently
similar
an
equity-based
approach
however
centers
around

individual
achieving
their
desired

such
approaches
promote
social
cohesion
collective
liberation
and
address
long-standing
inequities
such
as
poverty
public
health
social
mobility
and
overall
well-being
moreover
they
tackle
concerns
regarding
temporal
stability
and
robustness
by
establishing
consistent
criterion
for

deployment
phase
equity-based
approaches
lend
themselves
to
audits
legislation
and
transparency
as
they
deﬁne
singular
outcome
requirement
for
all
users
an
open
challenge
however
is
what
metrics
to
deﬁne
equity
with
respect
to
as
each
metric
targets
diﬀerent
kind
of
unfairness
equity
across
quality
of
information
targets
unfairness
when
one
person
gets
more
utility
from
their
query
compared
to
diﬀerent
query
of
another
person
for
example
this
type
of
equity
requires
that
we
equalize
the
number
of
recommendations
and
quality
of
information
provided
for
any
given
query
however
this
is
infeasible
as
we
cannot
control
the
quantity
of
information
known
for
given
topic
thus
given
that
there
are
inﬁnitely
many
distinct
queries
any
user
can
make
ensuring
that
each
query
has
the
same
number
of
relevant
articles
would
require
perfect
knowledge
equity
in
speed
of
access
to
information
targets
unfairness
when
one
person
receives
the
relevant
information
faster
than
another
this
equalizes
the
utility
for
every
user
by
either
slowing
down
or
acting
intentionally
uncooperatively
for
queries
that
are
more
easily
disambiguated
or
speeding
up
the
service
for
slower
queries
both
are
infeasible
the
former
fails
to
maximize
overall
utility
and
sacriﬁces
function
in
the
name
of
fairness
this
in
turn
renders
adoption
by
stakeholders
subject
to
capitalistic
pressures
even
more
unlikely
the
latter
is
also
infeasible
as
we
cannot
directly
control
disambiguation
rate
and
therefore
speed
up
some

information
is
an
inﬁnitely
shareable
resource
so
providing
information
to
one
person
does
not
deprive
someone
else
the
beneﬁt
of
that
same
information
therefore
speed
of
access
to
information
is
poor
target
for
an
equity-based
intervention
in
contrast
equity
in
epistemic
utility
targets
unfairness
in
personalized
access
to
the
information
resources
this
is
motivated
by
the
intuition
that
although
we
cannot
directly
control
the
availability
of
information
or
disambiguation
rate
everyone
should
have
some
baseline
access
to
all
information
thus
we
propose
an
upper
bound
on
the
number
of
queries
to
access
to
any
piece
of
information
this
means
that
if
the
information
does
exist
all
users
should
be
able
to
access
it
by
exerting
reasonable
amount
of
eﬀort
this
does
not
require
that
all
queries
have
the
same
accessibility
or
disambiguation
nor
that
all
users
be
provided
the
exact
same
service
it
does
provide
soft
guarantee
that
everyone
is
able
to
achieve
some
base-level
epistemic
utility
without
requiring
the
grouping
or
comparison
of
individuals
on
the
basis
of
their
values
needs
or
histories
epistemic
utility
particularly

the

right

of

deﬁnition
5.2
𝜖-equity
fairness
given
user
with
history
we
deﬁne
𝜖-equity
fairness
as
the
upper
bound
of
the
number
of
additions
to
the
search
history
such
that
for
any
given
content
𝑐𝑖
adding
queries
to
the
history
will
result
in
𝑐𝑖
enabling
the
user
to
obtain
the
relevant
content
here
we
consider
the
case
in
which
the
relevant
content
does
not
exist
as
out
of
scope
and
focus
purely
on
access
embracing
equity
as
fundamental
principle
of
fairness
presents
range
of
complex
challenges
these
challenges
encompass
deﬁning
baseline
level
of
equity
for
all
users
determining
the
pertinent
factors
that
contribute
to
establishing
such
baseline
and
deliberating
whether
these
considerations
should
be
domain-speciﬁc
or
universally
applicable
rather
than
proposing
singular
standard
we
propose
adopting
heuristic
operationalization
that
prioritizes
those
who
are
most
disadvantaged
in
terms
of
knowledge
and
understanding
our
intention
is
not
to
argue
for
strictly
prioritarian
perspective
but
that
the
incremental
advancements
can
achieve
the
ultimate
goal
of
equity
in
the
long-term
thus
we
advocate
for
equity
as
guiding
concept
to
achieve
equality
by
inductively
reaching
fairness
in
the
limit
having
established
deﬁnitions
inﬁnite
personalization
and
𝜖-equity
fairness
next
we
ﬂesh
out
the
tension
between
the
two
inherent
conflict
and
trade-offs
inﬁnite
personalization
we
posit
comes
at
cost
to
𝜖-equity
fairness
more
explicitly
in
inﬁnite
personalization
the
relevance
probability
of
some
information
𝑐𝑖
to
user
can
be
less
than
this
is
due
to
the
eﬀects
of
personalization
indexing
and
re-ranking
for
eﬃcient
navigation
across
the
vast
space
of
information
however
this
violates
𝜖-equity
fairness
as
some
information
will
be
eﬀectively
rendered
unreachable
within
ﬁxed
window
of
queries
we
provide
some
examples
of
trade-oﬀs
below

engine
personalization
prioritizes
results
relative
to
user
input
query
and
prior

past

personalization

fairness
vs
personalization
towards
equity
in
epistemic

the
key
takeaway
of
this
list
is
not
that
personalization
necessitates
unfairness
or
inequity
nor
that
fairness
is
not
achievable
in
personalized
systems
rather
to
emphasize
that
personalization
without
consideration
of
fairness
can
readily
lead
to
systems
that
deny
some
individuals
base-level
of
expected
epistemic
utility
policy
goals
and
examples
of
implementations
while
this
conceptual
analysis
provides
guidance
about
how
best
to
think
about
fairness
in
the
context
of
personalized
algorithms
it
does
not
provide
guidance
about
how
to
achieve
fairer
less
biased
systems
as
we
turn
to
more
practical
recommendations
we
start
by
considering
key
stakeholders
and
their
associated
roles
table
this
creates
lexicon
and
clariﬁes
the

of

each
of
these

available

can
lead
to
fairer
personalized
systems
see
table
these
actions
include
wide
range
of
governance
mechanisms
ranging
from
hard
regulation
to
soft
social
norms
we
emphasize
that
there
is
no
single
response
to
ﬁx
unfairness
in

systems
inevitably
many
interdependent
actions
will
likely
need
to
be
taken
in

to
make
progress
on
this
problem
moreover
these
are
by
