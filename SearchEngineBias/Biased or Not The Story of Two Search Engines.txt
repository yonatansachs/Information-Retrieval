ABSTRACT
Search engines can be considered as a gate to the world of WEB,
and they also decide what we see for a given search query. Since
many people are exposed to information through search engines,
it is fair to expect that search engines should be neutral; i.e. the
returned results must cover all the elements or aspects of the search
topic, and they should be impartial where the results are returned
based on relevance. However, the search engine results are based
on many features and sophisticated algorithms where search neutrality is not necessarily the focal point. In this work we performed
an empirical study on two popular search engines and analysed the
search engine result pages for controversial topics such as abortion,
medical marijuana, and gay marriage. Our analysis is based on the
sentiment in search results to identify their viewpoint as conservative or liberal. We also propose three sentiment-based metrics to
show the existence of bias as well as to compare viewpoints of the
two search engines. Extensive experiments performed on controversial topics show that both search engines are biased, moreover
they have the same kind of bias towards a given controversial topic.

INTRODUCTION

Search engines are a major source of information for many people
especially in the new millennium. While early search engines such
as Alta Vista had ranking mechanisms which were fairly simple
and transparent, later developments such as Google’s page rank
algorithm and further ranking methods based on click streams
completely changed that situation. Current search engines perform
retrieval and ranking based on many features introducing a complexity way beyond the simple model of relevance used in early
search engines.
The underlying ranking mechanisms of search engines indirectly
determine the information people are exposed regarding various
topics including controversial ones. On the other hand, due to the
fact that search engines are driven by algorithms, general public
may expect that they are neutral in the sense that the returned results are expected to cover all the elements or aspects of the search
topic, and they should be impartial where the results are returned
based on relevance. However, search neutrality is not necessarily
the focal point of modern search engines1 . Given a search engine
through which users are exposed to the news coming from different
sources where the Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) are gathered
and ranked by the search engine, there may be a bias towards a
view point in the result set. Assume that the user searches for 2016
Presidential Election and the top-k ranked results are displayed to
the user. The resulting set may be biased towards a specific political
1 https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-search/#SearEngiBiasProbOpac

view, such as conservative or liberal. Defining bias in a set of documents is challenging by itself, and the issue becomes even more
complicated if ranking is taken into account since we are not only
interested in the distribution of positive and negative opinion in the
result set but also the ranking in the distribution. Current research
in ranking employs learning to rank methods to return the most
relevant results (i.e. web documents) for a requested query to the
user. So the bias may come from the design of the ranking algorithm, i.e., training set of the learning to rank algorithms such as
click-through logs which intrinsically contain user bias, or machine
learning features proposed by algorithm designers which inherit
human-like tendencies that lead to human bias to train the system.
When personalisation is involved together with learning to rank
algorithms, then the bias can be justified by the fact that the resulting set of documents are determined based on the user preferences.
For instance, if the user is inclined towards liberal news which is
implied by her previous clicks on the returned results then it is
expected that the system learns that the user prefers positive news
(or documents) regarding the liberals and presents the user with
top-k liberally biased documents. Otherwise, the presented results
have what we call ”unjustified bias” towards a view point. People seriously rely on the results of search engines and they are influenced
by returning documents for a given topic. Therefore, unjustified
bias is becoming more dangerous, if users query strongly polarized
(i.e. controversial) topics. Hence, unjustified bias in retrieved results
especially for controversial queries is our main focus.
We analyse the SERPs of two major search engines, Google and
Bing, in order to detect any significant difference in the viewpoints
reflected in SERPs. We utilize opinion mining to understand if
a search result page has a positive or a negative bias towards a
specific view point. We collected and analysed the SERPs by at two
popular search engines to ensure that the bias is not specific to
one particular search engine. In this work, we try to answer the
following research questions:
• RQ1: Do search engines return non-biased result sets in
response to queries related to controversial issues?
• RQ2: On conservative-liberal scale, are the viewpoints of
search engines significantly different from each other towards
controversial topics?
• RQ3: If the retrieved results of search engines include bias,
can we determine the source of bias as input bias or algoritmic
bias?
Given the above two research questions, in the scope of RQ1,
detecting unjustified bias is a challenging problem especially when
ranking is considered. This is because, the bias cannot be measured
only by the distribution of the sentiment in the result set. The bias
measure should incorporate the rank of the returned results, as well.

ACM FAT, 2019, Atlanta, USA
For the second question, we compare the two search engines by taking into account sentiment as well as ranking information and see
if they show similar/different viewpoints on a given controversial
topic.
More specifically, we propose a sentiment-based comparison
procedure to understand if the retrieved documents of search engines contain bias, and also to make a pairwise comparison of
their perspectives on controversial issues. Experimental results
demonstrate that both search engines return biased results for our
sentiment-based metrics. However, the bias may originate from the
corpus itself which is known as "input bias". The corpus Moreover,
we show that Bing and Google have similar perspectives on the
corresponding controversial topics.
The paper is organised as follows. We first provide related work
on search bias. Second, we present our framework by explaining
our sentiment-based comparison metrics in detail. Then, we provide details regarding our SERP dataset crawling and evaluation
framework. We report our experimental results and discuss our
findings, and finally, we conclude our paper.

RELATED WORK

The term "search neutrality" is explained in a NYTimes article as
"The principle that search engines should have no editorial policies
other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based
solely on relevance 2
Issues regarding search engine bias have been summarized as [9]:
• search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has
embedded features in its design that favor some values over
others;
• major search engines systematically favor some sites (and
some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they
return in response to user search queries; and
• search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating
their lists of results for search queries.
A study done by Robert Epstein and Ronald E. Robertson demonstrated the effect of search engines in elections [3] The search
engine manipulation effect (SEME) and its possible impact on the
outcomes of elections. Here is an excerpt from the abstract "We
present evidence from five experiments in two countries suggesting the power and robustness of the search engine manipulation
effect (SEME). Specifically, we show that (i) biased search rankings
can shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent
or more, (ii) the shift can be much higher in some demographic
groups, and (iii) such rankings can be masked so that people show
no awareness of the manipulation." Their work is based on user
studied from different countries, and they do not have techniques
to automatically detect specific bias and ranked results. In a more
recent work by the same researchers, they presented that the existence of bias in election-related search results can have a strong
and undetectable influence on the preferences of undecided voters [4]. This work also does not include a method of automatically
identifying search bias, rather an empirical study.

Here is a blog that reports a study on "Google bias in search
results; 40 percent lean left or liberal" 3 . They relied on human
labelers from different political spectrum. Another popular article
in the Guardian states that "Google’s search algorithm appears to be
systematically promoting information that is either false or slanted
with an extreme rightwing bias on subjects as varied as climate
change and homosexuality." 4
Our main focus in this work is identifying and measuring the degree of bias in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) with an emphasis
on news sources such as NYTimes, and BBC news.
For example based on the analysis performed on a popular search
engine, Yom-Tov et. al. in [10] show that people are in fact more
likely to read opinions matching with their own and people are more
likely to read news from opposing sites given that the language
model of a particular news item is close to the language model of
their own political view. Yom-Tov et. al. also show that people who
were presented with more diverse results continued reading more
diverse results and overall became more interested in news.
Related research areas to Bias in Search Engines are: Topic Discovery from text, Sentiment Analysis, Echo Chambers and Filter Bubbles.
Topic discovery and sentiment analysis are essential to automatically identify if the results of a query provide information about all
the aspects and opinions on those aspects, thereby avoiding any
bias on search results for a specific topic.
Fang et. al. proposed a novel opinion mining research problem,
which they call Contrastive Opinion Modeling (COM) [5]. For a
given query topic over a database of text collections representing
multiple perspectives, Fang et.al. [5], define the task of COM as
presenting the opinions of the individual perspectives on the query
topic. Authors also quantify the difference of perspectives by the
Jensen-Shannon divergence among the individual topic-opinion
distributions. In our framework, we observed that topic discovery
may work for comparing search engines, however it ,s not sufficient
for the fairness analysis of search engines. For this reason, we decided to use sentiment instead of topic information to compare the
perspectives of the given search engines and measure the fairness
in the retrieved documents.
Aktolga and Allan consider the sentiment towards topics and
propose different query diversification methods based on the topic
sentiment [1]. They also measure the stability of the sentiment classification with various accuracy levels. A parallel work by Naveed
et. al. is related to "Feature Sentiment Diversification of User Generated Reviews: The FREuD Approach" [8].
More similar work to ours was fulfilled by Kulshrestha et. al. [7]
in which they measured different types of bias in search engines,
i.e., input or source bias, ranking system bias, and output bias which
is the cumulative of these two. They proposed different metrics
to compute and differentiate the distinct types of bias in politicalrelated tweets. Our work is different from their work mainly in four
ways. Firstly, we used news documents which contain structural
textual content not tweets for a detailed analysis. Secondly, we
did not propose new metrics, rather we utilized commonly used

Biased or Not?: The Story of Two Search Engines
traditional IR metrics (NDCG and average precision) by only modifying relevance grades with sentiment polarity values to detect bias.
Thirdly, we evaluated the retrieved documents of two commercial
search engines instead of Twitter and compared their perspectives,
as well in addition to solely detecting bias. And lastly, we did not
measure only political bias, but investigated the degree of bias (i.e.,
by using a fairness metric) in search engines for many diverse
controversial topics-related queries.
In addition to the search engine ranking system bias, the bias
may also be resulted from query, if the query itself has some polarity
or supports a specific viewpoint on a given topic. Things tend to be
phrased in a way that’s confirmatory of the user’s existing beliefs
”obama born in kenya”, and phasing can also take a side via terminology used by different sides ”gun control” vs. ”gun rights” [6]. We
will also consider query bias and fulfill our experiments accordingly.

SENTIMENT-WISE COMPARISON OF TWO
SEARCH ENGINES
3.1 Document-level Analysis
In document-level sentiment analysis, we obtain a sentiment value
for each document from TextBlob without any pre-processing step
on documents since TextBlob handles the punctuation itself. This
part of the analysis is more coarse-grained compared to sentencelevel analysis.

3.2

Sentence-level Analysis

Differently from the document-level, in sentence-level sentiment
analysis we view each document as a pile of sentences. We split a
given document into sentences and obtain polarity value for each
of its sentences from TextBlob. Then, in order to obtain a sentiment
score for the given document, we compute an average sentiment
score by summing the polarity values of all the sentences and dividing it by the number of sentences in the document, which provides
us a more fine-grained analysis of the given documents. That is
to say, from TextBlob’s point of view, in sentence-level analysis
each sentence is seen as a document and processed accordingly.
For clarification, we have again only one polarity value for each
document to compare the retrieved document sets of two search engines, although we compute these document scores in two distinct
ways as document and sentence level.

3.3

Sentiment Transformation Procedure

Apart from the sentiment analysis levels to make a consistent comparison among all controversial topics, one needs to think about
the connection between the semantic orientation (i.e. conveying
sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral) and the perspective of a
document in the scope of its controversial topic. For instance, if a
document has a positive sentiment score whose controversial topic
is abortion, the document’s perspective tends to be more liberal,
whereas if a document shows a positive attitude towards brexit,
its perspective would be more close to conservative. Therefore, to
interpret the sentiment score of a document on conservative/liberal
scale and use it for comparison, it is necessary to consider sentiment of the given document along with the perspective information
associated with its controversial topic.

ACM FAT, 2019, Atlanta, USA
Based on the example of interpreting semantic orientation in the
context of its controversial topic, after obtaining document polarity
values at two different levels via TextBlob, we applied transformation on the document polarity values of some controversial topics.
Transformation procedure is employed in order to put controversial
topics on the same scale and make a consistent comparison. To illustrate that if there exist two documents and one of them supports
liberal-perspective towards abortion and the other one advocates
brexit, they will possess different sentiment orientations (i.e. being
liberal means a positive attitude in the context of abortion, whereas
it conveys a negative sentiment towards brexit). Thus, we need to
apply transformation to one of these documents for consistency.
In this specific example, we transform the brexit document and
multiply its polarity value by -1. This is because in our evaluation
scheme, we prefer to favor liberal documents more, i.e. a more relevant document means a more liberal document for its controversial
query, thus we transform the polarity of a negative document if it
supports a liberal-perspective towards its controversial topic. Since
transformation is applied after document polarities are computed,
there is no difference in document-level or sentence-level transformation procedure. Note that the transformed topics are specified
in Table 1, and Table 2 for two datasets.

3.4

Comparison Metrics

We use three different sentiment-based metrics to compare returning documents of search engines. As the first metric, we directly use
the average sentiment polarities obtained from TextBlob. Secondly,
we propose a NDCG-Senti metric which blends with sentiment and
ranking information. Lastly, as the third metric, we use average
precision metric which favors the ranked lists containing more
frequent relevant documents (liberal documents in our scheme) for
a given controversial topic.
3.4.1 Average Sentiment Polarity. Our first metric compares two
search engines by purely using sentiment scores returned from
TextBlob and the range for polarity values is [-1, 1]. We obtain sentiment scores for documents, and sentences directly from TextBlob,
then compute an average polarity value as mentioned in the previous section for each document by exploiting document and sentence
sentiment values separately. That means that we only care about
document sentiment scores for comparison purposes, yet by computing these document scores in two different levels of sentiment
analysis, then transforming some of these polarity values if needed.
3.4.2 NDCG-Senti. In addition to the average sentiment polarity metric, we also need a more informative metric that will be
convenient to compare particularly the retrieved document sets
of two search engines. For this reason, we introduce a new metric, NDCG-Senti that blends ranking and sentiment information,
which is a variant of commonly used NDCG metric. We utilize the
traditional formula of NDCG to constitute our ranking-sentiment
metric NDCG-Senti replacing relevance scores 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑖 with sentiment
scores 𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑖 in the formula.
With a slight modification in the traditional formula of NDCG,
we come up with a modified NDCG scoring function which also
takes document rank into consideration in comparing the retrieved
document sets of search engines. However, there is still an issue in

ACM FAT, 2019, Atlanta, USA

the computation of transformed NDCG function that needs to be
considered that relevance grades in the traditional NDCG metric
are always positive, whereas the real sentiment values as well as
the transformed versions of these scores become negative since
the polarity values obtained from TextBlob lie between -1 and 1.
Therefore, the polarity values of documents are firstly transformed
and then normalized to be used for the computation of this secondly proposed metric. In short, we compute NDCG-Senti scores
with transformed and subsequently normalized sentiment scores
of TextBlob. The normalization procedure is described below.

map the polarities onto the range of [0, 1]. For each query, we compute a minimum and a maximum value from the computed polarity
values of the document set of each query. Then, we normalize the
polarity values using the minimum, maximum values and obtain
non-negative scores for the given set of documents. These values
are used to compute NDCG-Senti and average precision for a given
set of documents.

3.4.3 Average Precision. Our third comparison metric is average
precision which computes the frequency of relevant documents in a
document list by taking into account of ranking information. In our
presented scheme, precision is computed by using the frequency of
liberal documents (i.e. they are seen as relevant documents in our
framework) since we favor liberal documents and encourage them
to appear in lower ranks. For computation, we used the definition
of the expected value of average precision formula proposed in [2].

We collected two datasets using news API of the corresponding
search engines: Bing and Google. For this purpose, we implemented
scripts on python to automate the crawling process with the API
keys of the search engines. We crawled document contents returned
by a search engine in response to the controversial topics selected
from the website of https://www.procon.org/ in which contains
up-to-date controversial issues. We deliberately selected queries as
controversial in our evaluation scheme to measure bias, if exists and
observe the differences between the retrieval results of two popular
search engines clearly. We note that the data collection process was
fulfilled in a controlled environment such that the same queries
were sent to the search engines almost at the same moment since
the documents to be retrieved may vary by time.

3.4.4 Fairness. In our evaluation scheme, we compare search
engines mainly in two ways. First of all, we investigate if they
both return fair (no bias) results and subsequently, if they return
sentiment-wise similar set of documents for the same controversial query. However, to evaluate the fairness of the search results
retrieved from a search engine is challenging; we need to make a
definition of being fair mathematically. Or, we should have a baseline fairness metric to make a comparison. To introduce a fairness
metric we need to define the fair version of our three proposed
sentiment-based comparison metrics, then we can make a comparison between the fair metric score and the score computed from a
given set of documents. In this way, we can measure if the returning
results of a search engine significantly deviate from a fair set of
documents, using the corresponding comparison metric (average
sentiment polarity, NDCG-Senti, or average precision).
• Fair Average Sentiment Polarity: For a fair set of documents,
this metric should get a value of 0, since the sentiment scores
obtained from TextBlob lie in the range of [-1,1].
• Fair NDCG-Senti: To compute the fair version of NDCGSenti, we randomly generate 50 lists of document scores
and compute an NDCG score for each of these lists, then
obtain an average score over these NDCG scores. Note that
each generated list contains 10 documents and we randomly
choose 0 or 1 for each document score in the list. This is
because, NDCG-Senti scores are computed from the normalized sentiment scores and the values lie between 0 and 1.
After this procedure, we create a fair NDCG-Senti score and
we can see if a given document set is fair or not using this
metric.
• Fair Average Precision: To generate the fair version of average precision metric, we use the same 50 lists of documents
above and compute an average precision score for each of
these lists, then calculate an average score over these document sets.
3.4.5 Normalization Procedure. In order to get rid of negative
sentiment scores, we utilize min-max normalization technique to

4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
4.1 Dataset Crawling

4.1.1 Preliminary Dataset. For the preliminary dataset, we chose
15 "highly" controversial topic from https://www.procon.org/ on
the 25th of October, 2017 to see if our proposed method is useful to
measure bias and compare the returning document lists of search
engines. In this way, we have a rather small dataset and expect
more distinguished results of two search engines since we selected
the most controversial topics in the website. Since we have a small
number of topics, to retrieve more documents related to each topic,
we extended the query set by using Google Trends. Then, we filtered
the expanded query set, if i) an expanded query does not contain its
controversial topic words, or ii) it comprises any sentiment-baring
words. In filtering out the first type of extended queries enables
us to retrieve more relevant documents about the given controversial topic without losing context information. On the other hand,
the second type of filtering helps us on eliminating queries from
our query set that possibly introduce bias on search results (i.e.
some keywords that may convey positive/negative opinion about
its controversial topic), thus being able to focus on the contents
of the retrieved documents for a more fair comparison analysis.
In this way, we aim to send extensive but objective queries to a
search engine to obtain related documents about all the aspects of
a controversial topic.
For each query sent to the search engine, we crawled the first 10
documents returned from that search engine. The dataset is composed of 2030 documents in total for one search engine. The topic
distribution of the crawled dataset is shown in Table ??. In the table,
one can see that there are 160 documents crawled only for the controversial topic of abortion. This means that we have 16 expanded
queries for abortion since we use only the first 10 documents retrieved from the corresponding search engine. Moreover, topics
whose sentiment scores will be transformed before computing the
metrics are bold-faced in the table. Topics to be transformed were

Biased or Not?: The Story of Two Search Engines

ACM FAT, 2019, Atlanta, USA

determined by the majority voting of human annotators and topics
whose sides are clearly certain on conservative-liberal scheme were
selected for transformation.
After having expanded the query set, we applied filtering process
on the extended query sets of all controversial topics in the dataset,
and almost all query set sizes decreased. One may argue that some
query sets are really small in number as shown in Table 1. However,
note that small query set sizes were not the outcome of the filtering
process since the process did not exclude high number of queries
from the query sets. Small query set sizes may be caused by the
fact that the initial version of these extensive query sets at the
beginning were also very small comparing to the rest. On the other
hand, one reason for having small sized initial query sets could
be less number of various aspects/subtopics in the corresponding
controversial topic to get attention and being discussed on the
Internet.

Abortion
Animal Testing
Assisted Suicide
Brexit
Climate Change
Gay Marriage
Gun Control
Medical Marijuana

Trump

they are (i.e. including uppercased characters, and without
removing punctuations). Note that since we did not employ
query expansion in the second dataset, controversial topics
are our queries at the same time, so we can use a controversial topic and a controversial query interchangeably for
the second dataset. The controversial queries for the stable
dataset are shown and the topics whose sentiment scores
will be transformed are bold-faced in the Table 2. These
topics were determined by the majority voting of human
annotators and the ones whose sides are clearly certain on
conservative-liberal scheme were selected for transformation.
• Since there is no query expansion phase, we have one list of
documents for each controversial query (topic). Hence, we
have a single NDCG-senti, and an average precision score
computed for each topic so statistical significance test can be
applied on these computed scores directly. For average sentiment polarity, on the other hand, there is one sentiment score
for each document in the given set, thus we need to compute an average of these scores to obtain a single score for
each topic to be compared. However, in the case of the first
dataset, there exists one NDCG-Senti, and average precision
score for each query, since each controversial topic consists
of many queries, we need to compute an average of these
scores to generate one single score for each controversial
topic. Additionally, for average sentiment polarity, we initially computed an average over all the document polarities
in the given document set for one expanded query, subsequently we needed to compute the mean of these averaged
sentiment polarities to obtain one mean average sentiment
polarity for comparison.

• Lastly, we also made a query analysis and obtained the sentiment polarities for the controversial queries from TextBlob.
Polar queries are displayed in Table 3 with their polarity information. We repeated the same analyses with and without
these non-neutral queries to remove a possible source of bias
rooted from queries themselves.

4.1.2 Stable Dataset. In the second dataset, for a more comprehensive analysis, we got all 62 controversial topics in the website
of https://www.procon.org/ on the 31th of July, 2018. Our stable
dataset differs from the preliminary dataset essentially in the following elements:
• We did not select the controversial topic set since we need a
bigger dataset and also not to affect the results by injecting
bias on the input. Because the controversial issues given
in the website are mostly about US, we behaved as if our
location was somewhere in US while crawling. Differently
from the preliminary dataset, we crawled ooth the first 10
and 100 returned documents for each controversial query.
• Also, we did not expand the query set in this dataset because
of the issues encountered in establishing the first one and it
seems to prevent us from creating a controlled environment
by possibly introducing bias on the input. Thus, we used
62 controversial issues presented in the website exactly as

With these four factors, we aimed to crawl a more stable dataset
in a more controlled environment without introducing any bias on
the input and to analyse the contents of the documents returned
from search engines in terms of sentiment.

Evaluation Framework

In evaluating search engines, our main intent is to compare these
two search engines on conservative/liberal perspective towards
a given controversial topic. For comparison, we utilized TextBlob
sentiment scores at two different levels as document and sentence.
For evaluation, we used three sentiment-based metrics and computed these at two different levels, document and sentence on the
returning documents of Bing and Google. In using these metrics,
we aimed to answer the two following research questions we raised
in the beginning of the paper.
RQ1: Do search engines return non-biased result sets in
response to queries related to controversial issues?

values separately for each comparison metric and see if there is
a significant difference between Bing and Google in terms of the
corresponding metric.
4.2.1 Comparison Analysis. To answer the research questions
above, we used two datasets. The first dataset was used only for
preliminary results as its name implies. More comprehensive analysis was done in the stable dataset which was prepared in a more
controlled environment, that contains the first 10 as well as 100
retrieved documents and also incorporates query analysis to avoid
input bias.
Stable Dataset Results. : The raised research questions will be
answered for the second dataset in a more comprehensive manner.
All controversial queries: As you can see from the Table 4, 5,
and 6, all three comparison metrics gave consistent results. The
computed scores demonstrate that Bing and Google are similar
but they do not seem fair. Moreover, average sentiment polarity
scores computed from the first 100 documents also support the
same claim. Therefore, this may mean that not ranking algorithms
of search engines, but rather the corpus for the controversial issues
are biased.

To find an answer to this question, we need to compare the
retrieved results of a search engine with a fair list of documents. For
this purpose, we computed the scores of three proposed comparison
metric scores for all the retrieved results of a search engine and the
scores of fair version of the same metrics. Then we applied a twotail statistical significance test on these scores for each metric (i.e.
average sentiment polarity, NDCG-Senti, and average precision) to
see if there is a significant difference between the retrieved results
of a search engine and a fair list of documents. In this way, we
can decide if a search engine returns fair results in terms of the
corresponding metric.
RQ2: On conservative-liberal scale, are the viewpoints of
search engines significantly different from each other towards
controversial topics?
Subsequently, to investigate and answer to the second question,
we need to compare the overall perspectives of Bing and Google on
the same controversial topics. For this reason, we computed three
comparison metric scores on both Bing and Google’s returning
document lists for all the controversial queries in the query set.
Then, we applied a two-tail statistical significance test on these

Moreover, we plotted all the controversial topics to visualize
the distribution of average sentiment polarity, NDCG-Senti, and
average precision scores for the analysis of the first 10 documents,
and average sentiment polarity values for the first 100 documents
in Figure 1, 2, 3 and 4. In these plots, we denoted each controversial
query as a point; blue for a document-level and green for a sentencelevel score and put a y=x line (i.e. scores of Bing and Google are
equal on the line) for comparison. If a point is on the above of the
line, then its Google score is more positive than Bing and vice-versa.
You can also find the number of points with their percentages on
the x and y axis label of the corresponding plot.

Only non-polar controversial queries: In this part, we removed
the polar queries that are displayed in Table 3. In this way, we aimed
to eliminate input bias that may be caused from these polar queries
and obtain more accurate results. One can defend that some of the
polar queries shown in the Table 3 may not look like polarized
queries, however we did not want to pick the polar ones manually
and affect the results. Therefore, in our procedure, we accepted a
given query as polar if the TextBlob assigns a sentiment polarity
that is different than 0 to it. Since we also obtained the sentiment
scores from the TextBlob that we used in our framework, the whole
comparison procedure is consistent in itself, although some queries
do not seem strongly polarized.

Experiments fulfilled with non-polar queries only, the same result can be drawn from the average sentiment scores for the first
10 and 100 documents that most probably the corpus is biased (i.e.
there is input bias) , rather than the ranking algorithms of search
engines as seen from Table 8 and 11. Yet differently from the previous dataset, in the average sentiment scores for the first 10 and 100
documents, Bing and Google seem to be fair with the confidence of
99% if 𝛼 is set to 0.05, then these scores also support the same claim
as the scores of the previous dataset did. Thus, one can advocate
that if we eliminate the polar queries from the query set, in terms
of average sentiment polarity, both search engines seem to return
more fair results which encourages the fact that we could have
eliminated the injected input bias when we eliminated the polar
queries.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

To sum up, our experiments support that both commercial search
engines seem to return biased results for controversial queries.
Since we also measured bias in the corpus containing the first 100
documents, the bias may also be caused by the documents in the
corpus for the given controversial query. Moreover, from an overall
perspective, Bing and Google seem to have similar points of view
on the same controversial topic.
As a future work, we plan to apply aspect-level sentiment analysis on the retrieved documents for a more detailed framework. In
this way, we can analyse the search results in a more fine-grained
manner and it is necessary, especially for the controversial queries
including two sides in its textual content such as "Alternative Energy vs. Fossil Fuels" and "Israeli-Palestinian Conflict", etc. for a
proper comparison. Furthermore, documents can be retrieved from
the search engines of different countries and a location-based bias
analysis can be incorporated to our existing framework.
