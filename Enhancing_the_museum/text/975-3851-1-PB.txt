Introduction 
This study aims to explore the issue of social justice in museum contexts, setting as 
its primary objective the analysis and reflection on the dynamics of inclusion and 
equity within such institutions. Museums, while celebrated for their contributions 
to education and culture, also bear the responsibility of addressing historical 
inequalities and fostering inclusivity. This topic is of crucial importance, as 
museums represent places of great cultural and social relevance, but they often risk 
perpetuating inequality and discrimination of various kinds. Therefore, in this 
introduction, the following aspects will be examined: the statement of the research 
issue and the importance of Social Justice in museum context. This research will 
focus on identifying strategies and best practices aimed at ensuring greater 
accessibility and participation of all stakeholders in museum life, regardless of 
socioeconomic, cultural, or ethnic background. The analysis of the dynamics of 
inclusion and social justice in museums aims to provide important insights and 
action points for a society increasingly attentive to the values of solidarity, 
inclusion, and respect for diversity. Specifically, museum education should take into 
account the “tensions” present in contemporary society and promote an ethic of 
“equality” and “mutual recognition” (Colazzo & Manfreda, 2019). This requires 
museum staff to be constantly updated with respect to current regulations and the 
aspirations of the population. Today, this general principle can be declined in the 
theme of inclusion, which requires museums to go beyond facade inclusion and 
promote a real cultural readiness to “rethink” and “redesign” the ways, times, and 
places by which a museum educationally welcomes visitors. This research endeavor 
aims to centralize the discourse surrounding the theme of social justice within the 
milieu of museum environments, with a specific emphasis on conducting 
comparative analyses among various museum case studies, predominantly drawn 
from Switzerland, United States and Italy. 
 
1. The importance of social justice in museum settings: a DEAI (Diversity, 
Equity, Access, and Inclusion) approach to “rethink” and “redesign” 
museums 
This study aims to explore the issue of social justice in museum contexts, setting as 
its primary objective the analysis and reflection on the dynamics of inclusion and 
equity within such institutions. Museums, as spaces of cultural representation, 
thrive when they embrace diversity, provide equitable opportunities, ensure access 
for all, and foster an inclusive environment. The discussion here emphasizes the 

 
 
 
 
symbiotic relationship between social principles and the mission of museums to be 
agents of social change. In this section, the following aspects will be examined: 1) 
diversity, Equity, Access, and Inclusion (DEAI) Framework; 2) the role of Museums 
in Promoting DEAI; 3) DEAI's Impact on Museum Attendance and Visitor 
Satisfaction. Compared to the national context, In the United States and the United 
Kingdom, more attention is paid to “restricting” (do not expose/don't exhibit 
anymore) collections that might arouse opposition from ethnic minorities in certain 
museums, such as those of African Americans or Native Americans, in order to avoid 
offending or hurting anyone's sensibilities and to prevent possible legal action 
against museums displaying certain objects. This issue is known as “social justice in 
museums” in the English-speaking world and is related to the concepts of diversity, 
equity, accessibility, and inclusion, becoming increasingly relevant in Italy as well. 
Getting into specifics, this concept was coined to refer to a systemic approach to 
the management of organizations, which promotes diversity and inclusion in all 
aspects of its activities and can be declined in museum contexts (Shaindlin, 2020). 
“Diversity” refers to the variety of backgrounds, experiences, cultures, ethnicities, 
religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, and other individual characteristics that 
people bring with them. “Equity” refers to the promotion of equality of opportunity 
in order to eliminate barriers that prevent people from realizing their full potential. 
“Accessibility” refers to the creation of accessible environments and products for 
people with disabilities. “Inclusion” refers to the promotion and acceptance of 
people who are different in all aspects in the museum, creating an environment in 
which each person feels respected, valued and included. DEAI has become an 
increasingly important concept in many museums, as it promotes equality and 
inclusion, enhances museum attendance, and promotes creativity and visitor 
satisfaction. The preparation of the museum director and curators on issues of 
diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion becomes critical in these 
circumstances, as he or she must urge staff to pay close attention to these issues 
to avoid inaccuracies or regulatory violations, which could generate significant 
media “uproar”.  
 
2. Interpreting the Sense of Uncanny: Psychological Perspectives, PEGI, 
and Museum Experiences. 
In this paragraph we will delve into a specific theme: on a cognitive level, inequality, 
non-inclusion and injustice cause an emotional reaction in a person which often 
ranges from disgust, anger or at a lighter level a sense of the uncanny, here we will 
take the latter into consideration. The expression sense of uncanny, or restlessness, 

 
 
 
 
in psychology can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context in which 
it is used and the psychological theories considered (Galimberti, 2021, p.919). 
However, it refers to an emotional or psychological state characterized by a feeling 
of discomfort, anxiety, restlessness, or agitation. Here are some more common 
interpretations of sense of uncanny: 1) general anxiety, the sense of restlessness 
can be associated with general anxiety, which is a condition in which a person 
experiences constant worry, tension, and diffuse fear without a specific cause. This 
sense of restlessness can manifest through physical symptoms (such as tremors, 
sweating, and muscle tension) and emotional symptoms (such as nervousness, 
irritability, and excessive worry); 2) existential discomfort, in some psychological 
theories, the sense of restlessness can refer to a feeling of dissatisfaction or 
restlessness related to human existence and questions about life, the meaning of 
life, mortality, and other philosophical themes. This restlessness can lead people to 
seek a deeper meaning or explore their own beliefs and values; 3) state of 
uncertainty or indecision, the sense of restlessness can also refer to a state in which 
a person finds themselves in a situation of uncertainty or indecision, not knowing 
what to do or which direction to take. This can cause a feeling of discomfort and 
restlessness due to a lack of clarity or a defined path; 4) emotional restlessness, in 
some contexts, the sense of restlessness can be linked to an emotional state in 
which a person feels troubled or agitated without an apparent cause (Ibidem); 5) 
finally, a disturbing/uncanny effect may exist when human-machine interaction 
occurs (especially with new robotic and artificial intelligence systems), it refers to 
something that is strange, or unsettling because it is familiar yet unfamiliar, creating 
a sense of discomfort or unease, this feeling of the uncanny can arise in various 
contexts, including art, literature, and human-machine interaction (Pyszczynski, 
Greenberg, Solomon, 1999; MacDorman, 2005; Brenton & Alii, 2005; Mori, 
MacDorman, Kageki, 2012; Saygin & Alii, 2012; Conte, 2012; Kätsyri & Alii, 2015). 
This negative response is attributed to the digital characters falling into a 
perceptual “valley” on a graph of human-likeness versus likability.  
Why should museum education, museum directors and curators deal with the topic 
of the uncanny? It is possible for a sense of unease to occur in museums, especially 
in children, but also in adults. This can be due to several reasons: 1) disturbing 
content or objects, some museums may host exhibitions or displays that include 
objects or content deemed disturbing or frightening. For example, an art museum 
might feature works with “obscene” or “macabre” themes, or a historical museum 
might exhibit artifacts related to tragic or violent events. These elements can evoke 
unease in visitors of all ages or in special cases (think about the different 
characteristics of the visitors: cultures, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, 

 
 
 
 
etc.); 2) quiet and solemn atmosphere, many museums require quiet and respectful 
behavior, with a silent and solemn atmosphere. This environment can make some 
visitors, especially children, feel nervous or uneasy if they are not accustomed to 
this type of atmosphere (the solemn atmosphere can disinhibit the potential of 
play-educational activities that are very appropriate for children); 3) abstract or 
experimental art, some contemporary art pieces or experimental exhibits can be 
challenging to understand or interpret, which might generate unease or 
“confusion”, with respect to the interpretation of works of art, in visitors 
(interpretations that are sometimes trivializing or ridiculing of what is exposed); 4) 
fear of the unknown, children, in particular, may be susceptible to a fear of the 
unknown, so objects or artworks that appear strange or mysterious could trigger 
unease. To address these situations, it's important for parents or accompanying 
adults (educators) to prepare children adequately by explaining what to expect and 
answering their questions; if this is not possible, the technologies that mediate the 
installations should carry out this very delicate task. The signage should anticipate 
the content of the room, say whether it is suitable for everyone, whether it can 
arouse certain protests due to the content, advise whether the content is for 
everyone, etc. For example, it may happen that a very young child becomes 
frightened when he sees human skeletons in an archaeological museum. It is better 
to notify educators to decide how to present the contents of the rooms. Based on 
what has been said so far, a curator might consider something similar to the 
classification system PEGI1 at the entrance of the various museum exhibition halls, 
a multilingual iconographic system for visitors and the parents of visitors. This 
encourages curators to contemplate what they are displaying in the galleries and 
how they are doing so. the PEGI system was not designed to be used in museums 
or other cultural or educational contexts but as a classifier of the characteristics of 
APPs and video games. However, in museums and exhibitions, it is common to 
provide detailed information about the content of the displays so that visitors can 
make informed decisions about their visit. This information may include a brief 
description of the theme or content of the exhibited works, as well as warnings 
regarding potentially disturbing or age-inappropriate content. Instead of using the 
PEGI system, museums can adopt more specific and detailed communication 
strategies to provide guidance to visitors on the level of unease or appropriateness 
of the exhibits. This system actually labels the elements of fear, sexual content, 
vulgar language, racism and other characteristics that can give rise to problems in 
terms of the DEAI approach. This may involve creating informational cards,

explanatory labels, or using educational staff who can answer visitors’ questions 
and guide them through the exhibits appropriately. Furthermore, museums often 
aim to balance educational and cultural content with sensitivity to different 
audiences, so that important themes can be addressed without causing excessive 
unease or discomfort among visitors. Returning to a previously raised point, to 
avoid a quiet and solemn atmosphere the curator and the director of a museum 
navigate between their aesthetic needs and the socio-cultural ones which are in a 
certain sense secularized and have to deal with the needs of the time they live, of 
their public, of the common sensibility that varies and has new needs. At the same 
time, a director should take into account that restlessness and information 
memorization, in fact, emotions also affect the ability to learn and memorize 
information (Wolfe, 2006; Forgas, 2023). Restlessness can have a negative effect 
on the ability to learn and remember information conveyed in a museum. 
Therefore, museum operators should consider the impact of emotions on visitors' 
learning process. Likewise, it is good to remember that emotion is closely related 
to the arrangement of exhibits: the architecture and arrangement of objects within 
the museum can influence the visitor's emotion. In particular, the arrangement of 
objects can contribute to an emotional experience that can affect the perception 
of the artwork. Museum operators should consider the importance of creating 
exhibition spaces that are able to generate positive emotions in visitors. Technology 
can also be used to generate emotion and engagement in visitors. The emotional 
experience that is generated through the use of technology can be different from 
the traditional experience based on direct enjoyment of works of art. Museum 
operators should consider the importance of using technology effectively to create 
engaging emotional experiences. The emotional experience associated with visiting 
a museum can contribute to the formation of visitors’ cultural identity. In particular, 
the emotional experience can affect the perception of artworks and culture in 
general. Museum operators should consider the importance of creating emotional 
experiences that are able to form a strong cultural identity in visitors. 
 
2. A first case study: the Musée d'ethnographie in Neuchâtel how 
emotions are closely related to the arrangement of exhibits 
 
Understanding the inclusiveness of a museum requires a critical assessment of 
situations in which such inclusiveness is compromised, such as when the principle 
of social justice is violated or when the exhibition itinerary may be inappropriate 

 
 
 
 
for certain audiences. In the case of the Musée d'ethnographie in Neuchâtel2, 
Switzerland, these factors seem to indicate a lack of inclusiveness. We will now 
examine the curators' reasons for intentionally not eliciting criticism, with the aim 
of assessing whether these reasons are well-founded and consistent with the 
museum's exhibition goals. Statues and reproductions with religious themes can 
indeed evoke mixed emotions in a museum environment, particularly in 
ethnographic museums that may decontextualize these religious artifacts. This 
decontextualization can lead to both disturbance and appreciation, but the 
response largely depends on the visitor's perspective. Here are a few key reasons 
for this: decontextualization, in ethnographic museums, religious artifacts are often 
removed from their original sacred context and placed within a secular 
environment. This separation from their original religious settings can be disturbing 
to some individuals who view it as a form of desecration or disrespect towards the 
sacred; cultural sensitivity, visitors from religious backgrounds may have strong 
emotional connections to these artifacts and may find their display outside of a 
religious context unsettling. They might feel that the objects are being reduced to 
mere curiosities rather than revered symbols of faith; aesthetic appreciation, on 
the other hand, some visitors may appreciate the religious artifacts for their artistic 
and historical value. They may see them as valuable cultural and historical artifacts 
that can be studied and appreciated for their craftsmanship and historical 
significance; educational value, Ethnographic museums often aim to educate 
visitors about different cultures and belief systems. In some cases, the 
decontextualization of religious artifacts can be seen as a way to promote cross-
cultural understanding and dialogue, allowing people to learn about and respect 
the diversity of world religions. respect for sacred spaces, the mention of diocesan 
and archbishop museums highlights the importance of respecting the sacred. 
                                                           
2 it should be noted that the city has a museum tradition, it hosting the aforementioned 
museum boasts a considerable number of museums. One need only consider the presence 
of the museum dedicated to the La Tène culture (Bochnak, Kazakevych, 2023, p.68), named 
after the locality on the northern shores of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland. This culture held 
dominance in central Europe, particularly in the realm of art. Artifacts pertaining to the La 
Tène culture have been unearthed across an expansive geographical expanse, 
encompassing Western and Central Europe from Ireland to Romania. Additionally, the 
region also houses discoveries from the Roman era.

In these museums, there is a deliberate effort to maintain the sacredness and 
context of religious artifacts, which can create a more reverential and less 
                                                           
3 In accordance with the guidelines titled "Copyright Law - Practical Knowledge for 
Museums" by the Swiss Museums Association, the reproduction of artworks, even for 
internal documentation purposes and scientific endeavors, is not permissible without prior 
authorization. The same restriction applies to reproductions intended for informational 
purposes, such as for inclusion in a database. It is to be emphasized that, in this response, 
no photographs of the mentioned author have been included. More info:

disturbing environment for visitors of that faith. In summary, statues and 
reproductions with religious themes in ethnographic museums can evoke mixed 
emotions due to the decontextualization of sacred objects. Some may view it as 
disturbing or disrespectful, while others may appreciate it from an educational or 
historical perspective. The difference in reactions underscores the complexity of 
presenting religious artifacts in a museum setting and the importance of cultural 
sensitivity in curatorial decisions. In brief, sometimes the concept of sacred space 
is little respected between neighboring/similar cultures, perhaps this is precisely 
the case with this museum, located in a city that acts as a link between the 
Protestant society and the Catholic society. In this territorial hinge, what was once 
fought with weapons has now been reduced to small “disagreements” which 
however can generate problems that fall within the theme of the DEAI. In addition 
to what has been described so far which concerns the museum's permanent 
exhibition, there is the situation relating to a temporary exhibition at the same 
museum which should be studied in terms of DEAI. It explores the concept of 
“sauvage” (wild)6 from a social sciences perspective. It emphasizes the term's 
ambiguity, varying based on speakers, contexts, and cultural values. For an 
ethnographic museum, this theme delves into notions of otherness and challenges 
persisting stereotypes. In today's context, where progress induces anxiety, the 
concept of the wild transforms from a negative received idea (or cliché) to 
representing alternative solutions to societal issues.

The exhibition takes visitors through urban and natural landscapes, highlighting 
three distinct imaginaries, then explores their limitations. It concludes with a 
portrayal of an utopian space, blurring the line between wild and domestic. This 
innovative exhibition spans all three floors of the Black Box at the Museum of 
Ethnography in Neuchâtel. This exhibition, which explores the concept of “sauvage” 
from various angles, reflects the complexities of presenting cultural and religious 
artifacts in ethnographic museums. Just as the decontextualization of religious 
artifacts in such museums can evoke diverse responses, the interpretation of 
“sauvage” also hinges on the visitor's perspective. This highlights the need for 
cultural sensitivity in curatorial decisions, as visitors may either find the separation 
from the original context disturbing or appreciate it for its educational and 
historical value, much like how religious artifacts can be seen in ethnographic 
museums. The exhibition underscores the importance of fostering cross-cultural 
understanding while respecting the sacredness of certain artifacts, similar to the 
efforts made in diocesan and archbishop museums to maintain the sacred context 
of religious objects. 
3. A second third case study: Illinois State Museum, Advancing an Ethics 
of Equality Through DEAI Philosophy and Cultural Sensitivity 
In the United States, the Illinois State Museum was among the first to address this 
issue according to the DEAI philosophy, and it is good to know that the museum 
presents permanent and temporary exhibitions on the various disciplines 
represented, with a focus on Illinois natural history, American Indian culture, and 
the history of the people of Illinois. In addition, the museum offers educational and 
research programs for the public, such as educational workshops, special events, 
and study programs for students and researchers; the museum is committed to 
promoting understanding and appreciation of Illinois natural history and culture, 
and to working with local communities to share its knowledge and resources. In 
addition, the museum is committed to preserving and protecting the collections in 
its care to ensure their long-term availability and enjoyment. Cinnamon Catlin-
Legutko8, the Director of the Illinois State Museum, highlights the complex issues 
of racism and racial tensions that plague cities in the Midwestern United States, 
particularly those belonging to the Peoria and Kickapoo territories, which have 
suffered forced removal from their native lands. In this context, the creation of 
museum exhibits should demonstrate a particular “sensitivity” to their plight and

help give voice to the local and national community regarding this issue. Similar 
dynamics may manifest themselves in the countries of South America, Africa, and 
Indochina that have gone through the process of decolonization, as well as in Italy, 
where the wounds caused by wars and historical vicissitudes have left deep marks, 
which fortunately are not much but due to certain online press it is unfortunately 
on the rise9. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the analyzed process, it is 
essential not only to ensure the coexistence of different cultures but also to create 
a political space in which these differences can interact cross-culturally. Only 
through such a practice will it be possible to promote an ethics of equality that 
surpasses the ethics of mutual recognition (Colazzo, Manfreda, 2019, p. 151). In 
order to promote a society characterized by a decrease in the overall rate of cruelty 
and the expression of forms of solidarity, it is necessary for museums to create 
spaces for the organization of observatories, debates, and publications that can 
promote this ideal. According to Colazzo and Manfreda (2019), there are four forms 
of mutual recognition that need to be taken into account in all contexts, including 
museums, and they relate to the demands for recognition of individuals, primary 
groups, minority cultures, and national communities, as well as the entire human 
race. However, these demands for recognition may conflict with each other, 
generating what Berthoz (2011) refers to as “ancillary complexity”. Moreover, 
museums must be alert to these conflicts and seek to resolve them in order to 
promote the ethics of equality. 
 
4. A third case study: the Congregation of Mercy and the complexity of 
the distinction between meritorious organizations and fanatical 
groups 
 
The previous case study, relating to the Illinois museum, highlights the differences 
in cultural approaches from country to country. In light of this, this case study 
                                                           
9 Examples testifying to such national press dynamics include the events of Pontelandolfo 
and Casalduni. The events are revealed in the violent repression of the popular revolts that 
took place in these two cities of Sannio, in southern Italy, in November 1861. Resuming such 
events today can be biased in a nation that has made hard sacrifices to be united and to 
remain united after two World Wars. However, controversy must be taken into account 
when deciding to create an exhibition that "everyone will like". 
 

 
 
 
 
highlights these mutual misunderstandings which often have media and journalistic 
resonances. Below is a brief historical introduction to get into the perspective of 
this case study: the Congregation of Mercy is a Catholic religious organization 
founded in the 17th century in France by St. Vincent de Paul. Its main purpose is to 
spread “God's mercy” through works of charity and assistance to the poor, sick and 
needy. The Congregation was founded for the purpose of promoting the practice 
of Christian charity and mercy toward the needy. In particular, members of the 
congregation are committed to serving the marginalized people in society, such as 
the poor, the sick, the elderly and abandoned children. It has been active 
throughout the world for many years and has played a key role in assisting and 
caring for people in need.  
  
 
Figure 4. Congregation of Mercy, external front painting at the Church of S. Biagio 
in Nola (NA), Italy. 
Among the congregation's activities are care for the homeless, care for the 
terminally ill and care for abandoned or orphaned children. In addition, the 
Congregation is also dedicated to the spiritual formation of its members and to 
promoting greater involvement of the faithful in the practice of Christian charity. 
Members of the congregation are expected to live by high standards of morality 
and religious devotion, and to commit themselves full-time to their mission of 
community service. The phenomenon of ignorance or confusion between 
meritorious organizations and fanatical groups is an issue that requires critical 
reflection on the complexity of the contemporary social and political landscape. The 
confusion can emerge from several sources, including lack of correct and complete 
information, political propaganda, or the spread of stereotypes and prejudices. One 
of the main risks of confusion is the possibility of confusing meritorious 

 
 
 
 
organizations with extremist or fanatical groups, which may have an agenda 
radically opposed to that of the former. This can lead to negative consequences, 
such as loss of trust in civil society and increased political polarization. Such is the 
case with a 2017 journalistic article10, which reports in its own words a description 
of another Italian religious festival called La Festa di San Rocco, which features men 
wearing white hoods similar to those of members of the domestic terrorist 
organization that was founded shortly after the end of the United States Civil War 
and flogging themselves with whips until they bleed. The festival has ancient 
historical roots and is a tradition that is practiced every year (when it is practiced 
every seven aani). However, according to author Jasmine Stone, the practice of self-
harm, which is associated with faith and sacrifice, has raised, in America and 
certainly not in Italy, some controversy and criticism from some human rights 
organizations. The article does not provide an in-depth assessment of the opinions 
for and against this practice, but simply highlights the existence of different 
reactions and views on the issue. In this article, Jasmine Stone appears to be 
misinformed about the religious rite in question as well as the date of its 
celebration. The sole purpose of the article seems to be to arouse the curiosity of 
readers by showing masked individuals reminiscent of extremist or fanatical groups 
imagery, in order to increase the number of clicks and to satisfy both those who are 
interested in learning more about the issue out of indignation and those who 
harbor unseemly sympathies. Respect for cultures is crucial; when they are 
extrapolated they become a caricature, and another potential consequence is the 
emergence of a culture of erasure or censorship, in which people seek to eliminate 
or obscure ideas or opinions that do not match their beliefs. This kind of attitude 
can lead to an erosion of freedom of thought and expression, with negative 
consequences for democracy and social coexistence. To avoid these risks, it is 
essential to promote critical knowledge of meritorious organizations and fanatical 
groups, and to develop the ability to distinguish between them. In addition, it is 
necessary to promote history and culture correctly and comprehensively, so as to 
avoid the spread of stereotypes and prejudices that can fuel unawareness and 
confusion. Offenses to religious feelings can be caused by various factors, such as 
the use of blasphemous or vulgar words or images concerning deities, sacred texts, 
or places of worship. In addition, disrespect for religious rites or ceremonies can be 
perceived as offensive. Criticism and irreverence toward religious beliefs and 
practices may also provoke feelings of offense. In addition, some forms of art or

entertainment that treat religious themes in a disrespectful or satirical manner may 
be considered offensive by the faithful. Finally, discrimination based on religion or 
the use of religion as a pretext for acts of violence can be equally offensive to 
believers. To systematize what has just been said with the concept of DEAI, it is 
important to consider that freedom of expression and protection of the rights of 
religious minorities can coexist. Instead of emphasizing cancel culture (Ng, 2020), 
which can lead to censorship and restriction of freedom of expression, it is 
necessary to promote respectful and open dialogue between the various 
communities, respecting the dignity and rights of each. This requires a balanced 
approach that takes into account the sensitivities of people belonging to different 
religious or cultural groups, but at the same time does not restrict freedom of 
expression and thought. Similarly, The cancel culture may pose a risk to the 
protection and preservation of cultural property in that it may lead to the 
elimination or removal of works of art, monuments or other forms of cultural 
expression that may be considered offensive or problematic by some groups or 
individuals. This could deprive future generations of the opportunity to know and 
understand the past and culture of an era. It could also prevent critical discussion 
and debate on the important issues raised by these works of art, denying the 
opportunity to learn from history and create constructive dialogue about cultural 
diversity (Zúñiga, 2003; Subedi, 2008; Skubikowski, Wright, Graf, 2023). 
 
5. Advancing Museum Accessibility: Integrating Technology and Inclusive 
Design for All Visitors 
 
Information, communication, and adaptive technologies enable open learning 
modalities and facilitate activities with heterogeneous groups of individuals and 
children. These technologies serve as a common language that can be customized 
to meet one's specific needs and characteristics (EADSNE, 2012). At the same time, 
in contemporary museum and educational spaces, there is a growing integration of 
multimedia tools to enhance the sensory immersion in art and its historical context. 
This immersion is achieved through techniques such as spatial reconstructions, 
interactive scenarios, and advanced technologies like virtual reality and augmented 
reality. This approach benefits both visitors, who enjoy greater autonomy in 
experiencing art, and the cultural industry, which can create diverse, accessible, 
and emotionally engaging exhibitions by blending various forms of communication 
(Belardi, Menchetelli, 2023, pp.36-37). In this regard, technology serves both the 

 
 
 
 
visitor, who is granted autonomy in the enjoyment of artistic content, and the 
cultural industry, which can establish a multitude of levels of integration between 
traditional exhibition proposals and the various available tools. These levels range 
from advanced representation techniques such as the use of photographic 
enlargements, video projections, and holograms to virtual reality, where viewers 
are immersed in a virtual context through the use of headsets, and augmented 
reality, which involves the activation of multimedia content that can be triggered 
on demand, synchronized in real-time with virtual objects within the real scene 
(Ibidem). Moreover, in agreement with Belardi and Menchetelli, this integration 
extends to multisensorial experiences, allowing for the activation of visual, 
auditory, olfactory, tactile, kinesthetic, and multimodal content on request. It also 
encompasses widespread accessibility, characterized by the absence of 
architectural barriers, non-discriminatory design solutions, a wide variety of ways 
to enjoy the content, universal design principles, and differentiated experiential 
modes tailored for various user categories. Additionally, it involves the creative 
fusion of different modes of communication, including technological, narrative, 
educational, informational, emotional, and perceptual languages, culminating in 
the construction of complex emotional scenarios that can be replicated across 
different contexts (Ivi, pp.36-37). The future accessible museum combines the 
accessibility of spaces, the ability to “touch” artworks, and sign language guides 
with technology. The accessibility of art cannot be generalized, but must be ensured 
by respecting all types of disabilities. For the physically disabled, an accessible 
museum must, not should11, have accessible rooms and provide accessibility with 
appropriately sized ramps, elevators, doors, and lifting platforms. For the deaf, 
accessible museums should provide guided tours with LIS12 interpreters (or pre-
register videos), sign language descriptions, subtitles during video exhibitions, and 
written descriptions of artworks. For the visually impaired, accessibility is possible 
through the presence of detailed audio guides, tactile pathways, raised guides, and 
descriptions of works in Braille, enlarged versions, etc. For the intellectually 
disabled, simple communication and the activation of suitable routes is required. 
Convenient spaces and the availability of comfortable seating are important

12 Italian Sign Language (LIS) is not a mere abbreviation of Italian or a mimicry of it like 
Morse code or Braille. It's not just a basic manual alphabet or a tool to assist in spoken 
language expression. Rather, LIS is a distinct language complete with its own set of 
grammatical, syntactic, morphological, and lexical rules. https://www.ens.it/lingua-dei-

elements in ensuring museum accessibility for the elderly as well. In addition, 
considering the number and location of seating within exhibition rooms should not 
be seen as a sacrifice of design, but as an opportunity to integrate functional 
elements with aesthetic ones, thus ensuring a pleasant and comfortable experience 
for all visitors. Attention to museum usability and accessibility is a central issue in 
today's cultural debate and represents an ethical and social commitment on the 
part of cultural institutions to ensure access and active participation in culture for 
all citizens (EC, 2012). To ensure that museums are also accessible to people with 
physical disabilities, it is essential that these spaces be designed to meet specific 
accessibility requirements. This shows the importance of ensuring the accessibility 
of information to all visitors, including those with hearing disabilities, in order to 
enable full participation in artistic and cultural enjoyment. In addition, it would be 
appropriate for museums to adopt articulated and dynamic standards for the 
presentation of information and works, so as to ensure accessible and uniform 
enjoyment, regardless of the location and type of museum visited. For people with 
visual impairments, accessibility to museums is possible through the presence of 
detailed audio guides with explanations of the works on display, tactile pathways, 
relief guides. The challenge facing museums is to ensure accessibility for all, 
respecting the diversity of disabilities, through inclusive design and the adoption of 
technological and non-technological solutions to make a museum visit an inclusive 
and engaging experience for all visitors. Besides, the integration of multimedia 
tools, virtual reality, and augmented reality in contemporary museum and 
educational spaces represents a significant advancement in enhancing the sensory 
immersion of visitors in art and its historical context. However, as technology 
attempts to replicate the real world with increasing fidelity, it can inadvertently 
lead to the phenomenon of Uncanny Valley previously described. While the 
integration of advanced technologies in museums enhances the visitor experience, 
it's crucial to be mindful of this effect, where the pursuit of realism may 
inadvertently result in unsettling experiences for visitors, and it is necessary to 
avoid that the virtualization of the environment brings back or generates critical 
issues with respect to the DEAI approach described at length previously also 
through the proposed case studies 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
One of the fundamental tasks of museum culture and cultural heritage preservation 
is to interrogate objects whenever new questions can be posed by emerging 
technologies. Among these technologies, the reference is to the new digital 
environments that enable visitors not only to access information but also to 
experiment and create original meanings. It is precisely this process that allows 
artworks and cultural artifacts to convey information, knowledge, and emotions, 
transforming over time and undergoing resynthesis (Luigini, Panciroli, 2023, p.23). 
The holistic examination of the relationship between museums, social justice, and 
inclusion presented in this paper underscores the pivotal role museums hold as 
transformative agents within our society. As repositories of culture, knowledge, 
and history, museums wield a profound influence over the way we perceive, 
understand, and appreciate the diverse tapestry of human experience. For this 
reason museums can become a bridge between different cultures, near or far, and 
technologies, through customization and artificial intelligence, can become the 
translator of worlds that initially “do not understand each other” but which can 
begin to dialogue through a virtuous circle. This exploration has underscored the 
pressing need for museums to not only acknowledge their responsibility in 
addressing historical inequalities but also to actively engage with these issues. The 
DEAI perspective, with its core principles of Diversity, Equity, Access, and Inclusion, 
has emerged as a guiding light in this endeavor. It is clear that adopting this 
perspective is not merely a choice but an ethical “imperative” for museums to fulfill 
their potential as inclusive, accessible, and equitable institutions. Collaboration 
among museums, communities, scholars, and policymakers remains essential in 
this shared mission. By working together, the institutions can exchange ideas, 
experiences, and solutions to address the unique challenges faced by different 
cultural contexts and institutions. Ultimately, action is the linchpin of progress: 
museums must actively dismantle the barriers that hinder inclusivity, whether they 
are physical, sensory, or intellectual. It is “tassative” that museums prioritize 
education, training, and awareness initiatives for their staff to ensure that the 
principles of diversity, equity, access, and inclusion are integrated into every facet 
of museum operations. In doing so, museums have the opportunity to transcend 
their traditional roles and become catalysts for societal transformation. They can 
create a cultural landscape that not only reflects the principles of social justice and 
inclusion but actively contributes to shaping a more just, equitable, and 
compassionate world. This endeavor is not only a responsibility but also a privilege, 
one that empowers museums to be at the forefront of positive change, enriching 
the lives of all who engage with them. What can be a shared language to ensure 

 
 
 
 
inclusion for all visitors to a museum from the concept of DEAI? To ensure inclusion 
for all visitors to a museum, a common and shared language could be a mix of 
different modes of communication that fit the needs of all visitors, including: 1) 
clear and simple language, use easy-to-understand language to ensure that 
information is accessible to all visitors, regardless of their level of education or 
language proficiency; 2) multimedia learning preferences of visitors: provide 
information through different media such as images, video, audio, and text to meet 
the different teanching-learning processes (for example, Braille and tactile 
communication, providing information through tactile signage or braille writing for 
visitors who are blind or visually impaired; subtitles and sign language interpreters: 
provide subtitles or sign language interpreters for visitors with hearing 
impairments); 3) ensure physical accessibility to museum areas for visitors with 
mobility disabilities; The acknowledgment of the body as a protagonist in the 
process of perceiving and interacting with environments stands as a central 
element in the discourse on social justice and equity. Morover, the awareness that 
the body is closely tied to emotional and affective experiences shapes our 
understanding of the surrounding world. Consequently, integrating the body's 
perspective into urban planning policies and outdoor education can markedly 
enhance the learning experience and render spaces more accessible and inclusive 
for all, including individuals with disabilities; 4) ensure that museum staff are 
trained to welcome and assist visitors with special needs to ensure that all visitors 
are treated fairly and respectfully. A holistic approach that takes all these aspects 
into consideration can help ensure that the museum is inclusive for all visitors, 
regardless of their ability, age, ethnicity, or cultural background as seen previously. 
The DEAI perspective constitutes a pivotal approach for addressing inequalities and 
fostering a more inclusive and just society. In an increasingly interconnected and 
culturally diverse world, the recognition and appreciation of diversity become 
essential elements in the design museums. The DEAI approach advances equity, 
striving to overcome structural inequalities that constrain access to resources and 
opportunities. Nevertheless, its implementation may encounter challenges linked 
to resistance to change and partial adoption of policies and practices. It is 
imperative to avoid the risk of falling into tokenism, whereby diverse individuals 
are superficially included without addressing the real barriers that hinder full and 
equal participation. Nonetheless, embracing the DEAI perspective presents 
substantial opportunities to enhance existing policies and practices, cultivating 
welcoming and inclusive environments in both urban contexts and cultural 
institutions.
