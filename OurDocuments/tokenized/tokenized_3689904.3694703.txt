abstract
ranking
is
ubiquitous
method
for
focusing
the
attention
of
human
evaluators
on
manageable
subset
of
options
its
use
as
part
of
human
decision-making
processes
ranges
from
surfacing
potentially
relevant
products
on
an
e-commerce
site
to
prioritizing
college
applications
for
human
review
while
ranking
can
make
human
evaluation
more
effective
by
focusing
attention
on
the
most
promising
options
we
argue
that
it
can
introduce
unfairness
if
the
uncertainty
of
the
underlying
relevance
model
differs
between
groups
of
options
unfortunately
such
disparity
in
uncertainty
appears
widespread
often
to
the
detriment
of
minority
groups
for
which
relevance
estimates
can
have
higher
uncertainty
due
to
lack
of
data
or
appropriate
features
to
address
this
fairness
issue
we
propose
equal-opportunity
ranking
eor
as
new
fairness
criterion
for
ranking
and
show
that
it
corresponds
to
group-wise
fair
lottery
among
the
relevant
options
even
in
the
presence
of
disparate
uncertainty
eor
optimizes
for
an
even
cost
burden
on
all
groups
unlike
the
conventional
probability
ranking
principle
and
is
fundamentally
different
from
existing
notions
of
fairness
in
rankings
such
as
demographic
parity
and
proportional
rooney
rule
constraints
that
are
motivated
by
proportional
representation
relative
to
group
size
to
make
eor
ranking
practical
we
present
an
efficient
algorithm
for
computing
it
in
time
log
and
prove
its
close
approximation
guarantee
to
the
globally
optimal
solution
in
comprehensive
empirical
evaluation
on
synthetic
data
us
census
dataset
and
real-world
audit
of
amazon
search
queries
we
find
that
the
algorithm
reliably
guarantees
eor
fairness
while
providing
effective
rankings
human
decision-processes
are
increasingly
augmented
with
algorithmic
decision-support
systems
which
has
created
opportunities
and
challenges
for
addressing
group-based
disparities
in
decision
outcomes

in
this
paper
we
focus
on
selection
processes
where
humans
evaluators
use
rankings
to
organize
the
order
of
review
under
resource
constraints
we
argue
that
disparities
in
uncertainty
can
be
major
source
of
group-based
discrimination
in
this
setting
to
illustrate
the
problem
consider
the
following
example
of
college
admissions
at
highly
selective
institution
in
this
situation
there
are
far
more
qualified
candidates
than
available
spots
under
fixed
reviewing
budget
the
college
could
give
all
applications
brief
review
but
risk
high
error
rates
in
human
decision
making
or
use
ranking
to
focus
reviewing
efforts
on
the
more
promising
applications
the
latter
is
likely
to
decrease
error
rates
in
human
review
but
it
risks
that
this
prioritization
unfairly
favors
some
groups
over
others
for
example
consider
12
000
applicants
competing
for
500
slots
in
this
example
10
000
applicants
are
from
majority
group
with
plenty
of
available
data
and
the
model
can
quite
accurately
predict
which
students
will
be
admitted
by
the
human
reviewers
in
particular
it
accurately
assigns
probability
of
0.9
to
1000
of
the
students
and
0.01
to
the
remaining
000
the
remaining
2000
applicants
are
from
minority
group
where
the
model
is
less
informed
about
individual
students
and
thus
assigns
0.1
to
everybody
when
naively
ranking
students
by
this
probability
the
students
with
0.9
from
the
majority
group
would
be
ranked
ahead
of
all
the
students
from
the
minority
group
and
the
class
will
fill
up
with
the
expected
900
1000
0.9
qualified
majority
students
before
the
admission
staff
even
gets
to
any
of
the
minority
students
this
is
clearly
unfair
even
if
the
predictions
are
perfectly
calibrated
for
each
group
since
not
even
single
student
of
the
expected
200
2000
0.1
qualified
students
in
the
minority
group
has
chance
to
be
selected
by
the
admissions
staff
we
aim
to
define
new
way
of
ranking
that
does
not
introduce
unfairness
into
human
decision-making
process
even
if
the
predictive
model
shows
differential
uncertainty
between
groups
this
goal
recognizes
that
training
models
to
have
equal
uncertainty
across
groups
may
be
difficult
in
practice
since
lack
of
data
and
appropriate
features
for
some
groups
may
be
difficult
to
overcome1
importantly
key
principle
behind
our
work
is
to
leave
the
final
decisions
to
human
decision
makers
we
thus
aim
to
design
new
ranking
algorithms
to
most
effectively
support
fair
human
decision-making
process
and
not
to
replace
the
human
decision
maker

new
fairness
criterion
that
provides
meaningful
guarantee
for
rankings
that
are
used
to
support
human
decision
making
in
selection
processes
even
under
disparities
in
uncertainty
we
motivate
this
fairness
criterion
with
fair
lottery
22
44
ensuring
group-wise
outcomes
that
are
equivalent
to
allocating
scarce
resources
based
on
group-fair
lottery
among
the
relevant
candidates
based
on
this
notion
of
fairness
we
develop
new
ranking
procedure
that
is
group-fair
under
disparate
uncertainty
motivated
by
its
relation
to
the
equality
of
opportunity
framework
23
we
name
this
ranking
procedure
equal
opportunity
ranking
eor
we
analyze
eor
from
the
lens
of
the
cost
burden
on
each
entity
involved
the
principal
decision
maker
and
each
of
the
candidate
groups
and
formulate
the
cost
to
each
entity
as
the
lost
opportunity
of
access
given
that
the
candidate
was
truly
relevant
we
show
that
this
eor
procedure
equalizes
the
cost
burden
between
groups
and
present
an
efficient
and
practical
algorithm
for
computing
eor
rankings
this
procedure
always
produces
near
optimal
and
approximately
eor-fair
solution
in
particular
we
prove
an
approximation
guarantee
showing
that
the
gap
in
total
cost
to
the
principal
compared
to
an
optimal
algorithm
is
bounded
by
small
amount
in
addition
to
these
theoretical
worst-case
guarantees
we
present
extensive
experiments
benchmarking
the
eor
algorithm
with
various
existing
ranking
algorithms
under
different
settings
of
disparate
uncertainty
we
show
that
demographic
parity
58
61
normative
procedures
like
proportional
rooney-rule-like
constraints
exposure
based
fairness
criteria
49
and
thompson
sampling
policy
50
are
not
typically
eor-fair
under
disparate
uncertainty
we
find
that
these
results
hold
on
both
wide
range
of
synthetic
datasets
as
well
as
on
real-world
us
census
data
finally
we
explore
the
use
of
our
fairness
criterion
for
auditing
ranking
systems
using
real-world
dataset
of
amazon
shopping
search
queries
our
code

these
results
have
important
societal
implications
first
they
provide
evidence
that
naively
applying
existing
fairness
mechanisms
in
rankings
under
disparate
uncertainty
leads
to
unfairness
in
terms
of
one
group
bearing
the
majority
of
the
cost
of
opportunity
second
even
under
high
disparate
uncertainty
in
the
worst
case
eor
guarantees
an
approximately
equal
cost
burden
among
all
groups
with
bounded
additional
cost
to
the
human
decision
maker
finally
we
hope
our
results
inform
practitioners
to
collect
data
and
appropriate
features
for
candidates
in
all
groups
to
build
predictive
models
that
reduce
disparate
uncertainty
as
we
will
show
the
eor
procedure
elevates
the
candidates
with
high
uncertainty
in
the
rankings
for
human
evaluation
this
has
the
desirable
effect
of
producing
more
equitable
training
data
for
future
use
we
now
highlight
some
important
considerations
here
first
our
proposed
method
is
grounded
in
the
fairness
of
lottery
45
which
is
common
technique
for
allocating
scarce
resources
admission
slots
among
large
number
of
qualified
candidates
however
moral
and
philosophical
arguments
debating
the
use
of
lottery
and
randomization
for
certain
situations
have
also
been
made
26
we
hope
this
work
can
spark
discussions
on
alternative
notions
of
rastogi
and
joachims
fairness
in
rankings
that
satisfy
equality
of
opportunity
under
disparate
uncertainty
another
important
point
is
that
our
proposed
eor
procedure
reduces
unfairness
due
to
disparate
uncertainty
which
often
but
not
necessarily
coincides
with
the
historically
disadvantaged
group
since
eor
doesn
require
the
designation
of
the
disadvantaged
group
the
guarantees
we
provide
are
not
making
normative
statement
about
any
historically
disadvantaged
group
to
that
end
we
emphasize
the
careful
consideration
of
historical
and
social
context
that
needs
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
human
decision
maker
as
well
as
the
way
groups
are
defined
in
the
first
place
related
works
while
the
issue
of
fairness
has
been
heavily
studied
in
the
classification
setting
its
counterpart
the
ranking
setting
has
received
relatively
less
attention
below
we
highlight
key
areas
related
to
our
work
and
leave
more
detailed
discussion
of
these
and
other
related
works
to
appendix
fairness
in
rankings
and
selection
processes
while
there
exist
several
notions
of
fairness
in
rankings
64
predominantly
they
are
variations
of
two
fairness
mechanisms
in
existing
literature

and
equitable

31

48
49
we
propose
new
criterion
different
from
either
of
the
two
and
our
central
point
is
that
under
disparate
uncertainty
between
groups
it
is
more
fair
to
take
an
equal
proportion
of
relevance
in
expectation
rather
than
equality
by
size
or
exposure
proportional
representation
in
the
form
of
diversity
constraints
like
demographic
parity
58
or
affirmative
action
such
as
the
rooney
rule
guarantee
minimum
proportion
by
group
size
in
selection
processes
exposure
based
formulations
in
rankings
ensure
that
groups
of
candidates
are
allocated
exposure
in
an
equitable
way
such
as
in
proportion
of
amortized
relevance
over
the
full
ranking
in
this
work
we
demonstrate
that
fairness
of
representation
by
size
and
exposure
are
not
sufficient
under
disparate
uncertainty
fairness
in
rankings
under

our
work
builds
on
50
in
which
the
authors
establish
that
uncertainty
in
relevance
probabilities
is
primary
cause
of
unfairness
for
rankings
they
propose

that

studies
the
role
of
affirmative
action
in
the
presence
of
differential
variance
between
groups
in
rankings
differential
variance
implies
that
there
is
more
certainty
about
the
true
quality
scores
of
candidates
in
group
with
less
variance
in
the
estimated
quality
and
vice
versa
for
group
with
higher
variance
in
contrast
we
work
with
relevance
probabilities
instead
of
scores
and
focus
on
the
certainty
of
relevance
of
candidate
which
is
determined
by
how
close
the
predicted
relevance
probabilities
are
to
or
for
instance
group
is
highly
certain
if
the
probabilities
are
all
close
to
1.0
or
highly
uncertain
if
the
probabilities
are
all
close
to
0.5
while
both
groups
could
have
similar
variance
in
probabilities

under

has
also
been
studied
with

classical
literature
in
this
area
studies
whether
group-wise
calibration
is
necessary
condition
for
fairness
or
not
32
our
work
is
orthogonal
to
the
question
of
fairness
in
ranking
under
disparate
uncertainty
the
necessity
of
calibration
for
fairness
and
we
only
require
groupwise
calibration
as
sufficient
condition
for
the
eor
criterion
we
propose
our
work
complements
and
extends
prior
research
on
fairness
in
rankings
under
uncertainty
contributing
uniquely
in
several
ways
in
particular
we
provide
formal
framework
for
analyzing
the
unfairness
that
differential
uncertainty
induces
in
rankings
additionally
our
approach
involves
accounting
for
the
differential
uncertainty
directly
at
the
ranking
stage
unlike
prior
work
that
involves
learning
the
uncertainty
53
or
correcting
the
noisy
relevance
estimates
59
finally
our
proposed
eor
criterion
is
non-amortized
for
every
prefix
of
the
ranking
which
is
strictly
stronger
than
the
probabilistic
but
amortized
notions
of
fairness

un-fairness
due
to
disparate
uncertainty
in
rankings
we
want
to
design
ranking
policy
that
does
not
introduce
unfairness
into
human
decision
process
due
to
disparate
uncertainty
more
formally
the
task
of
is
to
compute
ranking
of
candidates
where
each
candidate
has
binary2
relevance
𝑟𝑖
which
is
unknown
to
the
ranking
policy
and
true
relevance
can
only
be
revealed
through
human
decision
maker
when
assessing
the
relevance
we
assume
that
the
human
decision
maker
goes
through
the
ranking
from
the
top
to
some
priori
unknown
position
the
goal
of
the
decision
maker
principal
is
to
find
as
many
relevant
candidates
relevant
products
qualified
students
as
possible
while
the
true
relevances
𝑟𝑖
are
unknown
we
assume
that
the
ranking
policy
has
access
to
predictive
model
of
relevance
𝑟𝑖
typically
trained
on
prior
human
decisions
and
features
of
the
candidates
sorting
the
candidates
in
decreasing
order
of
𝑝𝑖
𝑟𝑖
is
called
the
probability
ranking
principle
prp
41
and
it
is
by
far
the
most
common
way
of
computing
ranking
the
justification
for
prp
ranking
is
that
it
maximizes
the
expected
number
of
relevant
candidates
in
any
top-k
prefix
of
the
ranking
on
the
other
hand
demographic
parity
dp
is
the
dominant
form
of
fairness
mechanism
in
rankings
where
candidates
are
selected
from
groups
in
proportion
to
the
group
size
while
prp
ranking
is
provably
optimal
according
to
the
efficiency
goal
of
the
principal
and
dp
ranking
ensures
representation
by
group
size
the
following
elaborates
how
both
prp
and
dp
can
violate
fairness
3.1
illustrative
example
consider
medical
setting
where
candidates
need
to
be
evaluated
for
eligibility
to
participate
in
controlled
medical
trial
while
group
consists
of
candidates
with
rich
set
of
diagnostic
tests
that
inform
eligibility
candidates
with
health
insurance
group
consists
of
candidates
without
prior
access
to
such
tests
candidates
without
health
insurance
as
result
according
to
𝑟𝑖
in
figure
the
model
can
make
very
informed
predictions
for
candidates
in
group
while
for
group
the
model
cannot
reliably
differentiate
between
eligible
and
not
eligible
candidates
this
means
the
model
knows
exactly
which
candidates
in
2we
conjecture
that
our
framework
can
be
extended
to
categorical
or
real-valued
relevances

group
will
be
judged
as
eligible
by
the
human
decision
maker
but
it
will
make
undifferentiated
but
well-calibrated
predictions
for
candidates
in
group
figure
shows
that
the
prp
ranking
is
oblivious
to
this
disparity
between
groups
if
the
principal
needs
to
find
four
eligible
candidates
based
on
the
prp
ranking
they
are
all
selected
from
group
however
by
summing
the
probabilities
in
group
our
model
tells
us
that
we
can
also
expect
four
eligible
candidates
in
group
we
argue
that
deterministically
selecting
only
candidates
from
group
is
unfair
since
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
outcome
of
group-fair
lottery
for
the
four
spots
among
the
eight
eligible
candidates
now
consider
the
dp
ranking
in
figure
since
group
has
17
candidates
and
group
has
candidates
dp
will
select
roughly
one
candidate
from
group
for
every
two
candidates
from
group
we
argue
that
in
this
setting
dp
is
also
unfair
though
less
in
comparison
to
prp
as
it
selects
three
eligible
candidates
from
group
and
only
one
from
group
in
expectation
it
selects
2.6
out
of

only
0.6
out
of

we
show
empirically
later
that
other

mechanisms
motivated
by
representation
of

such
as

rooney

threshold-based

have
the

mode
importantly
note
that
it
is
not
evident
whether

be
the

group
we
argue
that
more
principled
and
fair
way
would
be
to
select
an
equal
fraction
of
relevant
candidates
from
each
group
in
expectation
consider
the
last
ranking
in
figure
which
approximately
fulfills
the
eor
fairness
we
formally
introduce
later
in
expectation
this
ranking
selects
more
equal
number
of
relevant
candidates
from
both
groups
making
it
similar
to
fair
lottery
in
particular
it
selects
1.8
out
of
relevant
candidates
from
group
and
1.2
out
of
relevant
candidates
from
group
this
eor
ranking
however
comes
at
an
increased
evaluation
cost
to
the
principal
as
it
selects
3.0
expected
relevant
candidates
from
both
the
groups
compared
to
3.2
with
dp
and
3.3
with
prp
as
result
the
principal
needs
to
review
more
candidates
to
select
the
same
number
of
relevant
candidates
with
eor
ranking
however
it
is
still
far
more
effective
than
lottery
which
selects
the
candidates
in
uniform
random
order
our
key
insight
is
that
eor
ranking
is
more
fair
not
because
it
takes
an
equal
number
of
candidates
from
each
group
but
it
is
more
fair
because
it
takes
an
equal
fraction
of
relevant
candidates
in
expectation
from
each
group
this
accounts
for
predictive
uncertainty
in
the
relevance
probabilities
because
even
when
one
group
has
sharp
and
the
other
group
has
non-sharp
𝑝𝑖
it
takes
approximately
equal
fraction
of
relevance
from
each
of
the

this
example
illustrates
the
intuition
behind
the
eor

we
formalize
in
the

we
will
show
how
to

we

additionally
we

finally

take
for

the

ensures
that

while
the

effectiveness

bad
it
has
the

property
that
the

if

if

if

the

we
formalize

its

come
at

to
the

the

since
only

the

particularly
inefficient
when
the

the
key
question
is
thus
whether
we
can
define
an
alternate

that
retains
the

this
provides

is
particularly
desirable
for

we
thus
need

provide
the

note
that
we
can
also
define
specific
slack
𝜎𝑘
for
each

for

this
slack
should
ideally
oscillate
close
to
zero
as
we
increase
and
so
minimizing
its
deviation
from

would
translate
to
ensuring
𝛿-eor

formally
we
can
define
𝜎𝑘
as
𝜎𝑘

𝛿-eor
fairness
balances
the

of

from
the

in
their

of

if
for
instance
the

is
less
certain
in
its

for

both

have
the
same
total

the
𝛿-eor
criterion
will
rank

from

higher
to
ensure
fairness
importantly
note
how
this
produces
more
human

labels
of

from
groups
with
high
uncertainty
which
has
the
desirable
side-effect
of
producing
new
training
data
that
allows
training
of
more
equitable

models
for
future
use
finally
note
how
the
𝛿-eor
fair

provides
means
for
ensuring
procedural
fairness
and
avoiding
disparate
treatment
importantly
we
leave
the
decision
of
which
candidates
to
select
to
the
human

maker
and
eor
fairness
does
not
require
the

instead
the

𝐹𝑆
is
similarly
anchored
on
the
principle
that
top-k
ranking
is
fair
when
the
proportion
of
disadvantaged
candidates
selected
doesn
fall
far
below
required
minimum
proportion
and
also
requires
the
designation
of
disadvantaged
group
in
this
example
𝐹𝑆
gives
the
exact
same
top-4
ranking
and
eor
criterion
as
shown
for
45
th
rule
in
summary
the
predominant
fairness
criteria
in
rankings
motivated
by
the
representation
of
size
perform
very
differently
than
the
𝐸𝑂𝑅
as
an
example
consider
the
well-documented
issue
of
female
candidates
not
being
selected
for
leadership
positions
primarily
due
to
their
small
applicant
pool
size
25
if
the
female
applicants
have
high
disparate
uncertainty
due
to
lack
of
historical
data
affirmative
action
may
still
select
far
fewer
based
on
group
size
of
them
than
deserved
based
on
the
number
of
relevant
female
candidates
we
now
briefly
consider
two
other
notions
of
fairness
in
rankings
for
the
running
example
first
we
look
at
the
exposure-based
formulations
49
the
principle
of
exposure
is
motivated
by
position
bias
in
rankings
and
ensures
the
allocation
of
position
in
rankings
in
proportion
to
the
expected
total
relevance
while
the
position
of
selected
candidate
is
certainly
important
it
does
not
take
disparate
uncertainty
into
consideration
𝐸𝑋
is
stochastic
policy
that
allocates
equal
exposure
between
the
two
groups
in
this
example
both
groups
have
an
equal
expected
total
relevance
over
the
full
25
positions
of
the
ranking
𝐸𝑋
allocates
most
of
the
probability
mass
to
candidates
in
group
for
all
of
the
top-4
positions
not
because
they
have
high
uncertainty
but
because
their
group
size
is
smaller
than
group
this
results
in
high
cost
burden
for
group
and
the
eor
criterion
is
computed
as
𝜎4𝐸𝑋
0.58
higher
than
both
𝐸𝑂𝑅
and
𝐷𝑃
later
in
section
we
demonstrate
how
𝐸𝑋
places
higher
cost
burden
on
the
uninformative
group
instead
when
both
groups
have
relatively
the
same
size
finally
we
discuss
the
thompson
sampling
based
fairness
in
rankings
50
for
𝜋𝑇
binary
relevances
are
drawn
according
to
𝑟𝑖
𝑟𝑖
and
candidates
are
sorted
in
decreasing
order
of
relevance
𝑟𝑖
with
their
ranking
randomized
for
the
same
value
of
relevance
the
eor
criterion
for
top-4
ranking
produced
by
𝜋𝑇
can
be
computed
as
𝜎𝑇4
0.29
for
the
running
example
while
𝜋𝑇
takes
the
predictive
uncertainty
of
relevance
into
account
by
randomization
of
rankings
it
is
group
oblivious
and
so
does
not
account
for
the
difference
in
the
predictive
uncertainty
of
relevance
between
groups
this
explains
the
high
eor
criterion
of
specific
𝜎𝑇
with
median
𝑛𝑘
𝜎𝑘𝑇
as
compared
to
that
of
the
𝐸𝑂𝑅
while
we
discussed
how
eor
differs
from
existing
fairness
notions
above
we
will
further
demonstrate
this
comparison
via
extensive
empirical
evaluations
in
section
one
of
our
key
contributions
includes
formalizing
the
connection
between
𝛿-eor
fair
ranking
described
in

4.1
and
the

in

both

and
cost
of

in
rankings
are
derived
separately
the
former
from
the
axiom
of
fairness
of
uniform
lottery
the
latter
from
the
cost
of
errors
that
any
realistic
prediction
model
is
bound
to
make
in
the
next
section
we
show
that
these
two
are
elegantly
related
via
theoretical
results
on
cost
optimality
computing
eor-fair
rankings
we
now
turn
to
the
question
of
how
to
compute
𝛿-eor
fair
ranking
𝐸𝑂𝑅
for
any
given
relevance
model
𝑟𝑖
this
ranking
procedure
needs
to
account
for
two
potentially
opposing
goals
first
it
needs
to
ensure
that
𝛿-eor
fairness
is
not
violated
ideally
for
that
is
not
larger
than
required
by
the
discreteness
of
the
ranking
second
it
should
maximize
the
number
of
relevant
candidates
contained
in
the
top
for
any
a-priori
unknown
while
solving
this
optimization
problem
in
the
exponentially
sized
space
of
rankings
is
computationally
inefficient
we
show
that
algorithm
is
an
efficient
ranking
method
that
provides
close-to-optimal
solution
algorithm
uses
as
input
the
prp
rankings
𝑃𝑅𝑃
and
𝑃𝑅𝑃
for
each
of
the
groups
and
respectively
we
denote
𝑃𝑅𝑃
as
the
𝑡ℎ
element
in
the
prp
ranking
of
group
the
basic
idea
is
to
compare
the
highest
relevance
candidate
from
each
group
and
select
the
candidate
that
would
minimize
the
for
the
resultant
ranking
breaking
ties
arbitrarily
when
selecting
an
element
from
either
group
results
in
the
same
for
the
resultant
ranking
consider
our
running
example
from
figure
at
selecting
the
first
element
from
group
𝑃𝑅𝑃
would
result
in
𝜎1
0.9
while
selecting
the
first
element
from
group
𝑃𝑅𝑃
would
result
in
𝜎1
0.6
to
minimize
𝜎1
the
algorithm
selects
the
first
element
from
group
with
𝜎1𝐸𝑂𝑅
0.6
𝜎1
0.6
for
the
first
element
from
group
and
the
second
element
from
group
are
considered
it
proceeds
to
select
the
first
element
from
group
with
𝜎2𝐸𝑂𝑅
0.6
0.9
𝜎2
0.3
and
so
on
the
algorithm
does
not
change
the
relative
ordering
between
candidates
within
group
and
its
runtime
complexity
is
log
since
the
elements
from
the
two
groups
each
need
to
be
sorted
once
by
𝑟𝑖
composing
the
final
eor
ranking
𝐸𝑂𝑅
by
merging
the
two
group-based
rankings
𝑃𝑅𝑃
and
𝑃𝑅𝑃
takes
only
linear
time
since
each
computation
per
iteration
is
constant
time
per
prefix
while
algorithm
is
inspired
by
existing
algorithms
such
as
61
in
that
both
select
the
top
element
from
the
prp
ranking
of
each
group
they
are
fundamentally
different
existing
methods
including
61
ensure
form
of
demographic
parity
which
we
have
already
shown
to
be
fundamentally
different
than
the
eor
criterion
we
propose
additionally
while
61
requires
threshold
input
and
the
designation
of
disadvantaged
group
the
eor
algorithm
does
not
require
this
normative
designation
and
guarantees
eor
fairness
without
requiring
any
tolerance
as
an
input
we
show
this
both
theoretically
and
in
empirical
evaluations
and
provide
detailed
description
of
baseline
algorithms
in
appendix
it
remains
to
be
shown
that
algorithm
always
produces
ranking
𝐸𝑂𝑅
with
small
while
surfacing
as
many
relevant
candidates
as
possible
in
any
top
prefix
we
break
the
proof
of
this
guarantee
into
the
following
steps
first
we
show
that
for
any
particular
and
its
associated
𝜎𝑘𝐸𝑂𝑅
the
number
of
relevant

in
the

is
close

we
provide
an
upper

on
𝜎𝑘𝐸𝑂𝑅
that
is
entirely
determined

by
the
specific
𝑟𝑖
to
address
the
first
step
the

that

proof

we

linear

to
prove
this
theorem
to
find

on

we
formulate
the

this

that

is

to

the

𝑃𝑅𝑃
across

𝐸𝑂𝑅

how

𝐸𝑂𝑅

in

we

how
the

it
shows
that

an
equal

across

which
can
be
seen
from
the

furthermore
the

incur
substantial

some
even
worse
than
the
uniform

in
particular
𝐷𝑃
selects
the

alternately
between
the
two
groups
since
group
sizes
are
relatively
similar
but
this
results
in
selecting
higher
proportion
of

from

because
the

are
sharper
for
group
than
for

result
the
cost
burden
is
higher
for
group
𝜋𝑇
is
fairer
than
𝑃𝑅𝑃
since
it
randomizes
relevant
candidates
before
sorting
them
in
decreasing
order
of

however
being
group
oblivious
it
still
places
an

conclusion
this
paper
studies
the
problem
of
disparate
uncertainty
across
groups
as
source
of
unfairness
in
ranking
when
these
rankings
are
used
as
part
of
human
decision-making
process
in
particular
this
paper
introduces
framework
that
formalizes
this
unfairness
by
relating
it
both
to
fair
lottery
and
to
the
costs
that
an
imperfect
model
imposes
on
the
various
stakeholders
recognizing
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
avoid
disparate
uncertainty
in
real-world
models
the
paper
develops
the
eor
procedure
to
produce
rankings
that
provably
mitigate
the
effects
of
disparate
uncertainty
between
groups
beyond
its
strong
theoretical
guarantees
we
find
that

method
outperforms
existing
methods
for
fair
ranking
across
wide
range
of
settings
furthermore
we
illustrate
that
the
eor
criterion
can
also
be
used
as
tool
to
audit
real-world
system
we
conjecture
that
this
combination
of
theoretical
grounding
computational
efficiency
and
strong
empirical
performance
provides
viable
conditions
for
making
the
proposed
framework
and
algorithm
accessible
for
thoughtful
use
in
practice
ethical
considerations
this
work
explicitly
addresses
the
potentially
negative
societal
impact
of
machine
learning
predictions
that
include
disparities
between
groups
in
the
context
of
ranking
interfaces
however
as
pointed
out
by
previous
research
34
46
we
do
not
prescribe
distilling
down
the
fairness
of
system
into
single
metric
the
fairness
criterion
we
propose
we
emphasize
that
it
is
important
to
carefully
consider
the
domain
specifics
and
the
particular
situation
where
our
method
may
be
deployed
we
also
note
that
while
our
eor
algorithm
does
not
worsen
the
fairness
within
each
group
within
group
ordering
is
maintained
it
doesn
improve
within-group
fairness
either
exploring
this
dichotomy
of
satisfying
within
and
between
group
fairness
simultaneously
in
the
presence
of
differential
uncertainty
is
an
important
open

on

64
the
classical
fairness
desiderata
considered
are
variations
of
proportional
representation
17
58
broadly
proportional
representation
ensures
representation
by
group
size
in
top
selection
or
at
every
prefix
of
the
ranking
other
popular
notions
include
diversity
based
constraints
10
16
57
like
rooney
rule
and
affirmative
action
that
ensure
representation
of
the
designated
disadvantaged
group
and
threshold
based
formulations
54
61
63
that
ensure
minimum
number
of
candidates
to
be
selected
from
the
disadvantaged
group
another
prominent
class
of
fairness
notions
in
rankings
corresponds
to
exposure
based
formulations
exposure
43
49
62
quantifies
the
amount
of
attention
allocated
to
candidates
individually
or
from
particular
group
these
formulations
include
equity
of
exposure
disparate
treatment
of
exposure
that
allocates
exposure
proportional
to
amortized
relevance
and
disparate
impact
of
exposure
that
allocates

economic

among
other

see
for
similar
concept

diversity
constraints
and
exposure
are
motivated
by
representation
by
group
size
normative
designation
of
disadvantaged
group
and
allocation

respectively
our
work
on
the
other
hand
is
motivated
by
unfairness
due
to
differential
uncertainty
between
groups
and
is
grounded
in
the
axiomatic
fairness
of
lottery
system
our
problem
setup
involves
aggregating
candidates
from
groups
and
while
research
on
fair
rank
aggregation
appears
related
the
goal
there
is
much
different
in
particular
fair
rank
aggregation
achieves
maximum
consensus
accuracy
when
multiple
voters
rank
all
candidates
subject
to
fairness
constraints
of
group
exposure
or
p-fairness
55
work
on
multi
sided
fairness
52
similarly
considers
diversity
constraints
or
exposure-based
formulations
finally
while
31
42
50
propose
an
amortized
notion
of
fairness
our
work
proposes
non-amortized
fairness
criterion
at
every
position
of
the
ranking
recently
there
has
been
growing
interest
in
the
study
of
fairness
in
rankings
under
uncertainty
the
classical
desideratum
in
this
literature
studies
the
relation
of
group-wise
calibration
for
fairness
11
20
29
32
38
our
work
is
orthogonal
to
this
discussion
in
particular
we
only
assume
that
calibrated
probability
of
relevance
is
given
and
instead
focus
on
how
differential
sharpness
of
probabilities
can
cause
unfairness
50
introduced
an
approximate
notion
of
fairness
that
is
violated
if
the
principal
ranks
candidates
that
appear
more
than
certain
proportion
of
their
estimated
relevance
distribution
one
way
to
achieve
this
in
expectation
is
through
randomization
of
relevances
drawn
from
the
predictive
posterior
distribution
other
works
have
introduced
methods
that
quantify
uncertainty
in
rankings
53
to
update
and
learn
better
estimates
of
relevances
iteratively

between

while
methods
that

for

we
also
need
to

for

due
to
the
existing

that
is
unfortunately
widespread
in

our

we
note
that
this

confounding
due
to
the
use
of

other

that
may
be

however
the

does
demonstrate
how

can
be
used
for
auditing
if
the
