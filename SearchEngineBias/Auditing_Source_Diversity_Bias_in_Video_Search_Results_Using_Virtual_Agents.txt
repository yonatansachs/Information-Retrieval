ABSTRACT
We audit the presence of domain-level source diversity bias in
video search results. Using a virtual agent-based approach, we
compare outputs of four Western and one non-Western search
engines for English and Russian queries. Our findings highlight
that source diversity varies substantially depending on the language
with English queries returning more diverse outputs. We also find
disproportionately high presence of a single platform, YouTube, in
top search outputs for all Western search engines except Google. At
the same time, we observe that Youtube’s major competitors such
as Vimeo or Dailymotion do not appear in the sampled Google’s
video search results. This finding suggests that Google might be
downgrading the results from the main competitors of Googleowned Youtube and highlights the necessity for further studies
focusing on the presence of own-content bias in Google’s search
results.

INTRODUCTION

The public tends to put high trust in the information retrieved
via search engines [1]. However, search engine outputs are prone
to different forms of bias [11, 21] which can result in distorted
representation of subjects which users are searching for [12, 25].
One way of uncovering bias in web search outputs is to engage
in algorithmic auditing [24]. Though a few studies have audited
bias in text and image search (e.g., [21, 22, 26]), to the best of
our knowledge no audits of video search results were conducted.
However, video search is important in the societal context since
people increasingly consume news via online videos [20] and treat
video hosting platforms as a preferred environment for news finding
[30]. The fact that video information can have powerful influence

on users and even affect their behaviors [10, 17] prompts the need
for auditing whether video search is subjected to bias.
To address this gap, we investigate the presence of source
diversity bias - that is a systematic prevalence of specific information
sources [11] - in video search outputs. By consistently prioritizing
the same set of sources independently of search queries, search
algorithms can diminish the quality of outputs by making them less
representative [25] and negatively affecting the user experience
[6]. Source diversity bias is also related to the phenomenon of
search concentration, namely the tendency of search engines to
prioritize few well-established domains over other sources [19] that,
according to media, often results in search companies promoting
their own services (e.g., YouTube in the case of Google [33]). By
diminishing the diversity in the composition of source domains,
companies can consolidate global media monopolies [19] through
gaining unfair advantage over their competitors.
To examine whether video search outputs are subjected to
source diversity bias, we audit search results coming from five
search engines - four Western (Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google, and
Yahoo) and one non-Western (Yandex) - in response to English and
Russian queries. Including Yandex along with queries in Russian a language dominating the main markets of Yandex - allowed us
to test whether (some of) our observations can be attributed to
structural differences between Western and non-Western markets
(e.g., almost monopolistic status of Google in the former and its
competition with Yandex in post-Soviet countries). We use virtual
agent-based auditing approach to prevent search outputs from
being affected by search personalization and search randomization.
Then, using a selection of metrics, we assess the level of source
domain diversity in search outputs and investigate whether there is
evidence of certain engines prioritizing specific information sources.
Specifically, we examine whether search engines tend to promote
platforms associated with their parent companies (e.g., Alphabet
for Google or Microsoft for Bing) or downgrade the competitors as
was claimed by earlier research [19].

RELATED WORK

The problem of auditing systematic skewness of web search outputs
is increasingly recognized in the field of information retrieval (IR)
[11, 12, 16, 25]. Existing studies primarily look at it from one of the
two perspectives: user bias and retrieval bias. User bias concerns
skews in user perceptions of search outputs [15]. Retrieval bias
relates to a skewed selection of search results [12, 16].
One form of retrieval bias, which the current paper focuses on, is
source diversity bias. Originally discussed in the context of search
engines’ tendency to prioritize web pages with the highest number

WWW ’21 Companion, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia

of visitors [16], source diversity bias is currently investigated in the
context of prioritization of certain categories of sources in response
to particular types of queries (e.g., [23]). A disproportionate visibility
of specific types of web resources can diminish overall quality of
search results [6] and provide unfair advantage to companies and
individuals that own specific search engines [16] - e.g., through
own-content bias, - or direct most of the traffic to a handful of
well-established sources, a phenomenon also known as search
concentration [19].
To date, source diversity bias has been primarily investigated in
the context of text search results [7, 31, 32] with the focus exclusively
on one engine - Google. At the same time, few comparative studies
that were conducted highlight substantial cross-engine differences
in search diversity bias levels [18, 23, 34]. In the case of video
search results, there is no systematic comparative assessment of
source diversity bias. In 2020, the Wall Street Journal [33] and,
subsequently, Mozilla [3] have found that Youtube appears among
the top-3 featured "carousel" results in text search 94% of the time
[3]. These findings highlight search concentration [19] around
Youtube in Google’s "carousel" results. However, it is unclear, first,
whether the distribution of domains is similar in dedicated video
search results. And second, how Google’s results compare to those
of its competitors - a comparison that is necessary to establish
whether Youtube’s dominance in video search results from the way
Google’s algorithm works exhibiting own-content bias. We aim to
address these gaps with the present study.

METHODS

In this study, we have opted for a combination of methods for bias
detection in web search outlined by Edelman [8]: 1) comparative
analysis of the results provided by multiple search engines across
a variety of search queries in two languages; 2) identification
of skewness of results towards specific domains and whether
the skewness, if observed, can be explained by market structure
incentives. We have used video search results from the 4 biggest
Western search engines by market share - Google, Yahoo, Bing,
DuckDuckGo, - and one major non-Western search engine - Yandex
[2]. Since Yandex has the largest presence in post-Soviet states where
large shares of populations speak Russian as a first language, we
utilized queries in both, English and Russian, to conduct the search
and estimate whether there are differences in the observations.
There were 62 queries in total - 31 English queries with translations
into Russian, - that concerned contemporary events (i.e., the US
presidential elections and coronavirus), conspiracy theories (i.e.,
Flat Earth), and historical events (i.e., Holocaust)1 . Below we outline
the details on the data collection and analysis.

3.1

Data collection

To collect the data, we utilized a set of virtual agents - that is
software simulating user browsing behavior and recording its

used the following queries: coronavirus, bernie sanders, joe biden, pete buttigieg,

outputs. The benefits of this approach, which extends algorithmic
auditing methodology introduced by Haim et al. [13], is that it
allows controlling for personalization [14] and randomization [23]
factors.
For the current study, we built a network of 84 CentOS virtual
machines based in the Frankfurt region of Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2). On each machine, we deployed 2 virtual agents (one
in Chrome browser and one in Mozilla Firefox browser), thus
providing us with 188 agents overall. Each agent was made of two
browser extensions: a tracker and a bot. The tracker collected the
HTML and the metadata of all pages visited in the browser and
immediately sent it to a storage server. The bot emulated a sequence
of browsing actions that consisted of (1) visiting a video search
engine page, (2) entering one of the 62 queries, and (3) scrolling
down the search result page to load at least 50 images. Before
searching for a new query, the browsers were cleaned to prevent
the search history affecting the search outputs, and there was a
7-minute break between searches to mitigate potential effects of
previous searches on the results.
The study was conducted on February 26, 2020. We equally
distributed the agents between five search engines: Google, Bing,
Yahoo, Yandex, and DuckDuckGo (DDG)2 . Because of technical
issues (e.g., bot detection mechanisms), some agents did not manage
to complete their routine. The overall number of agents per engine
which completed the full simulation routine and returned the
search results differed by query - sometimes the search engine
would detect automation and temporarily ban the agent. This was
particularly often the case with Yandex, where for some queries
all 34 deployed agents successfully finished the routine while for
others (a minority of queries) Yandex only returned the results
for 10 agents and banned the rest. The mean number of agents
who completed the full routine by engine across all queries is the
following: Bing (29), DDG (34), Google (33), Yahoo (31), and Yandex
(17).
After the data was collected, we have extracted top-10 individual
video links obtained by each agent for each search query and
proceeded with the analysis using this data. Our decision to rely on
the top-10 results only is motivated by the fact that users tend to
pay the most attention to the first few results - i.e., those on the first
results page [27]. A comparison of search results by browser has
demonstrated that there are no major between-browser differences
- a finding in contrast with those observed for text search results
[23] - thus for the analysis we have proceeded aggregating the
results for both browsers.

Data analysis

3.2.1 Source diversity. To assess whether there is evidence
suggesting that diversity bias - that is, lack of source diversity, - is
present in the sampled results on domain level, we have calculated
how many distinct source domains are, on average, present in the
results for each query. To account for the potential randomization
due to so-called "Google Dance" [5] in the results, for each query
we aggregated the calculation over the results obtained from each
individual autonomous agent. Afterwards, we have calculated mean
2 For

all engines, the ".com" version of the image search engine was used (e.g.,
google.com).

Auditing Source Diversity Bias in Video Search Results Using Virtual Agents

numbers of distinct sources separately for English and Russian
queries to establish whether there are differences in the observations
depending on the language of the search. We have also qualitatively
examined the results per query to find out whether there are distinct
patterns with regard to query categories.
3.2.2 Search concentration. To establish whether there is evidence of search concentration in the collected video results, we
have calculated, first, the share of times different domains appear
as the top result for each search query, and second, the proportion
of times different domains appear among the top-10 search results
per query at all. We suggest that the consistent appearance of a
specific domain or few specific domains at the very top of search
results and, in general, among top-10 results more frequently than
the others would indicate search concentration.
In addition, we have scrutinized the results with regard to owncontent bias exhibited by Google according to the media [33].
We aimed to establish whether Google’s results lend evidence
of own-content bias either through the promotion of Youtube in
the results or the demotion of the results provided by its main
competitors. One way to assess that is to compare Google’s results
with those obtained through other search engines [8] and see
whether there are major differences in the observed frequencies of
appearance of different domains between them. Thus, we compared
the proportion of times each domain - Youtube and its competitors
such as Vimeo, Dailymotion and Rutube, - appears in the results
provided by different engines.

WWW ’21 Companion, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia

Qualitative analysis of the domain diversity by query has demonstrated that there are no consistent patterns with regard to the
proportion of distinct sources by query category in our dataset.
Hence, we suggest that domain diversity is affected more by the
algorithms used by each search engine examined and, probably,
the data they are trained on - the latter might explain the observed
differences between Russian and English queries, - rather than by
the specific topics of the search queries.

4.2

Search concentration

As shown in Fig.2, Youtube has been featured as the top result most
frequently in all cases but one - namely, the results for English
queries on Yandex where Vimeo surfaced as the first result most
often. Remarkably, on Google itself Youtube appeared as the top
result less frequently than on other platforms, a finding in contrast
with those made by The Wall Street Journal [33] and Mozilla [3] in
the context of featured video "carousel" on the first page of Google’s
text results. DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Yandex are the three engines
exhibiting sizeable differences in the prominence of Youtube as
the top result between English and Russian queries with Youtube
being featured as the top result more frequently in response to
English queries. We suggest that the findings reported in Fig.2 lend
evidence to search concentration bias in video search results on
the examined search engines, with the effect in our sample being
stronger for English than for Russian queries.

the top result.
Figure 1: Mean number of distinct domains in top-10 video
search results (Y-axis) per query, grouped by query languages (legend) and search engines (X-axis)
As Fig.1 shows, there are differences in the level of source
diversity exhibited by the examined search engines. Google has
consistently presented more diverse video results in terms of source
domains than its competitors. Yandex has taken a second place
in terms of domain diversity. This domain diversity hierarchy is
similar for both English and Russian queries, albeit for the Russian
queries the observed domain diversity is a bit lower on all five
search engines than for the English queries.

In Fig.3 we list the domains most frequently featured among
top-10 search results on each of the examined search engines for
English and Russian queries. As with the top-1 result, the domain
most frequently featured in top-10 is Youtube on all engines but
Yandex in response to English queries where the most frequent
domain is Vimeo. The share of other domains in search results is
comparatively marginal - less than 10% - in almost all cases with
the exception of Ok.ru for Russian queries on Yandex. Youtube thus
emerges as the most prominent domain in search results. Apart
from it, there is no other domain that is among the top 5 domains
most frequently appearing among the first 10 results on all search
engines.

Figure 3: Domains most frequently appearing among top-10 results by query group and search engine and % of time a domain
appears among top-10 results.
The findings reported in Fig.3 suggest that search engines feature
different arrays of domains - with the exception of Youtube - in
search results. Google tends to retrieve results from legacy media in
both Russian and English more frequently than other search engines,
a finding in line with the previous research [7, 31, 32]. Other search
engines also include some legacy media, though to a lower extent
than Google, as well as social media (e.g., Ok.ru, Facebook.com), and
several video portals that are Youtube’s competitors - Dailymotion,
Vimeo and Rutube. None of these potential Youtube competitors,
however, appear in the top-10 results on Google in our dataset at all
despite their presence on other search engines. Vimeo, Dailymotion
and Rutube all appear at least once among the top-10 results
on all search engines except Google. This finding suggests that
Google might downgrade Youtube’s direct competitors, however
an analysis based on a broader spectrum of queries is necessary to
estimate the scope and persistence of this result.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Top 10 outputs of video search for most of search engines except
Google show limited source diversity. By relying on average on
2-3 unique sources to retrieve top results for English queries,
search engines create a situation in which users’ information
choices are shaped by a few content providers. This raises concerns
about search engines facilitating consolidation of power on the
information markets.
The only exception among the five search engines examined is
Google, where the degree of source diversity is almost twice as high.
This effect can be attributed to Google putting substantial effort into
diversifying search results in response to earlier criticisms. With
6 unique domains per 10 top results, Google follows its declared
principle of having no more than 2 results coming from the same
domain in the top results [4]. The finding also suggests that low
diversity on other search engines is likely attributed to the absence
of diversification mechanisms which Google implements.
The importance of integrating diversification measurements
is highlighted by high degree of source diversity bias. The top
results for all search engines (except Yandex in English and Google)

are dominated by one platform, namely YouTube. Its systematic
prevalence reinforces the platform’s almost monopolistic status.
It is problematic considering that the platform is already used
as a major news source among certain shares of the population
[20], despite earlier audits demonstrating that its algorithms might
lead to user radicalization [29] and, affected by users’ viewing
history, aggressively promote pseudoscientific content to users
who have watched pseudoscientific videos before [28]. Search
concentration around Youtube can only help cement its monopoly
and the associated effects.
Google fairs better than other search engines in terms of domainlevel source diversity and, at a first glance, does not exhibit owncontent bias since Youtube is less prominent in its results than on
other search engines. However, in our sample, Google is the only
search engine that did not provide any results from Youtube’s major
competitors. It is thus plausible that Google indeed, as media reports
suggested [33], might be downgrading the results coming from
the major competitors of Youtube thus exhibiting own-content
bias manifested not in promoting Youtube but in lowering the
prominence of its competitors in search results. However, it could
also be that the obtained results with regards to Google and the
absence of Youtube’s competitors in its outputs are specific to the
topics addressed by our sample of queries and is absent in other
contexts. Hence, to make a robust conclusion about the presence
or absence of own-content bias in Google’s video search results,
further studies encompassing broader sets of queries are necessary.
We suggest that our observations highlight the need for such
studies.
Further, the present analysis is based on a snapshot experiment
on a limited selection of queries. We believe that our findings
warrant subsequent longitudinal audits of video search results to
assess the persistence of our observations and, potentially, the
changes that occur overtime. Such audits are crucial to inform the
decisions of policy-makers and regulators. This is especially timely
and pressing given the recent anti-trust cases against Google [9]
and calls for putting tech giants under scrutiny, among other, in
the context of their market power.
