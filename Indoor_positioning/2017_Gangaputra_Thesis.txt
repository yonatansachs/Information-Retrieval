iiiAbstract
Based on the recent decades’ researches, it can be seen that way finding and navigation
are playing a vital role and are being the most popular research areas of Location Based
Services. Although wayfinding and navigation, when concerned with the outdoor
environment is a vastly explored area, it has been gaining more attention in the indoor
environment in recent times. Indoor navigation as compared to outdoor navigation has
its dependence on the technology (Lyu, H. et al., 2015) which has some limitations
concerning the accuracy of location information, required output media and also
cognition of the user concerning the indoor environment.
In spite of all the theories on indoor landmark and indoor wayfinding and many
experiments being conducted, indoor navigation still needs to be explored and explained
in order to make navigation in an indoor environment easier. Through this thesis, an
attempt is made to make navigating in an indoor environment easier. The paper focuses
on developing a more vivid definition for indoor landmark, a flowchart on how an indoor
landmark could be derived, comparison between an indoor and an outdoor landmark and
characteristics of an indoor landmark. The feasibility of the developed theories are
proved by conducting case study.
The user test gave desired results. The definition given in the hypothesis is vivid and
completely explains and defines an indoor landmark. From the questionnaire feedback,
it was seen that most of the participants could differentiate between an indoor and an
outdoor landmark and have gained knowledge about the characteristics of an indoor
landmark. Though, more than half of the participants were from a similar educational
background, they said that the user test had given them a much clear impression of the
difference between indoor and outdoor landmark and navigation in an indoor structure.
As the indoor objects can be classified into three different types such as figural level,
vista level, environmental level, one of the findings of this thesis along with fulfilling the
above mentioned proposals is that indoor landmarks should fall under vista and
environmental level. An indoor landmark falls into figural level only if there are no
prominent landmarks that fall under vista and environmental level in the chosen location
as figural level objects are replaceable.

viii1 Introduction
1.1 Navigation in Indoor and Outdoor Environments
Navigation refers to the study that involves the determination of position and direction. It is a
known fact that outdoor navigation has gained utmost prominence in the past decade.
Technically, scientifically and academically, navigation focused on the outdoor cartography
and less prominence was given to indoor cartography. In fact, outdoor navigation has become
so prominent that it is used in a person’s day-to-day life with different tools like maps, GPS,
smartphone apps. Nevertheless, it is seen from recent publications on indoor cartography that
lately, indoor navigation is being the main focus for researchers which resulted in developing
relevant theories for academia and also leading to technical developments. In spite of the
contributions made, the indoor navigation stream is in need of a constant development and
attention, which means that to take the indoor navigation on to a practical level, lot more
research has to be done and the results should be accessible to the audience. It can be said
that lack of accurate data and expensive technology are two of the main reasons for indoor
navigation to fall behind in development than outdoor navigation.
Through this thesis, an attempt is made to contribute theoretically to the field of indoor
navigation.
Indoor navigation is becoming a much bigger topic day-by-day because of the complexity it is
causing in a person’s daily life. Navigation is supposed to be one of the simplest tasks in one’s
life to make travelling easier. But, in today’s urban world, navigation is no more an easy task.
Especially, when it is related to a complex indoor structure, it is becoming almost impossible
at times to reach the desired destination. This thesis, as the title denotes, addresses the issue
of indoor navigation and indoor landmark identification. In the fast growing field of Geographic
Information Systems, it is absolutely important that we use navigational equipment such as
GPS (Global Positioning System) and maps to make our lives simpler and save time. But this
scenario is true only when outdoor environment such as roads are considered, as there is
already sufficient data and media that is being implemented into the navigational systems that
are being used in a person’s day-to-day life. Also, there is constant attention to detail of the
data being uploaded and with the increasing technology, it is becoming easier to update the
navigational systems for more accurate information. In order to implement this indoors such
as in university buildings, airports, shopping malls, etc., the researchers are finding inhibitions
with the technology which has some limitations concerning the accuracy of location
information, required output media and also cognition of the user.
11.2 Background and Motivation
Lyu, H. et al. (2015) proposed guidelines for the users to perform better navigating and
orienting in an indoor environment by building mental maps, reasoning of a route plan, and re-
orienting for maintaining the right direction. There are sometimes failures in navigating in an
indoor environment because of the poorly executed design of the building and the poorly
designed sign system and numbering system.
Indoor wayfinding is usually performed in two situations: 1) when people plan their route across
multiple rooms in a complex indoor structure and 2) when people want to find a place in a big
complex building. Reorientation takes place when people face choices between different
directions (or routes). Landmarks are important in both the above mentioned tasks for which
spatial knowledge is also required.
Spatial knowledge for wayfinding can be categorized into three levels, i.e. landmark
knowledge, route knowledge and survey knowledge. Landmarks are served in wayfinding for
multiple purposes, such as organizing space structure, indicating orientation, and denoting
location (Lynch, K., 1960; Presson, CC. and Montello, DR., 1988; Lovelace, K. et al., 1999).
For navigation applications, landmarks are also considered as important elements (Burnett
GE, 1998; Hölscher, C. et al., 2006; Millonig, A. and Schechtner, K., 2007).
The research done till today in the field of indoor navigation has truly achieved notable success
along with theoretical, scientific and technical developments. Although, while revising the
context of the previous papers, there is an unoccupied space where a clear definition of an
indoor landmark is lacking. Or, it can be said, a more vivid definition is required in order to
understand the scenario of indoor landmarks and indoor navigation along with which we also
need to understand the workflow of how to derive an indoor landmark and how it is different
from outdoor landmark and navigation.
Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to develop a vivid definition for indoor landmark and study
the existing research papers of Lynch, Presson and Montello and Lovelace as well as Burnett,
Hölschcer, Millonig and Schechtner on indoor landmark extraction and indoor navigation. In
addition, the thesis focuses on deriving a flowchart on how indoor landmarks would be
identified and derived, comparisons between an indoor and an outdoor landmark and also on
defining the characteristics of an indoor landmark. A user test is conducted in order to prove
the hypotheses developed.
21.3 Problem Statement and Goals
Ohm, C. et al. introduced in 2014 the entities that could be indoor landmarks, for example,
doors and stairs (Ohm, C., 2014). But, a vivid definition of an indoor landmark is still to be
developed, along with this, the differences between and indoor and an outdoor landmark,
extraction process of an indoor landmark and identification of the characteristics of indoor
landmarks are to be given insights for the development of indoor navigation. To address these
problems, the goals of this thesis are listed as follows:
1. To give a theory on differences between an indoor landmark and an outdoor landmark and
describing the characteristics of an indoor landmark.
2. To develop a vivid definition for the term ‘indoor landmark’ that can be used by the future
researchers.
3. To develop a flow chart that describes the flow of actions performed in identifying a
geographical or a structural entity as a landmark.
4. To perform a user test in order to verify the above mentioned theories.
1.4 Hypotheses and Research Questions
1.4.1 Indoor Landmark Definition
Lynch, K. (1960) defined landmarks as external points of reference that are not part of a route.
While this definition forms the basis of any landmark, the definition of the indoor landmark is
given through a hypothesis as:
An ‘Indoor Landmark’ is a point of interest in the inside of a structure which could be a
route maintenance point, an external point of reference or a route decision point that
can either help the person to navigate and explore inside the building or to locate the
desired point of interest.
The above definition explains that any entity that is helpful in maintaining the route taken,
deciding which route has to be taken and/or can be taken as a point of reference in any indoor
structure can be considered as a landmark. This landmark can be either used to reach a
particular destination or to explore in the inside of the structure.
31.4.2 Research Questions
The potential research questions, based on the above mentioned goals of this thesis include:
1. What is the difference between and indoor and an outdoor landmark?
2. What are the characteristics of an indoor landmark? What feature or quality belonging to
an entity would serve as a landmark in an indoor structure?
3. How can an indoor landmark be defined?
4. What are the indicators on how these indoor landmarks should be extracted?
1.5 Methodology
To answer the research questions mentioned above, certain methods are adopted for each of
the questions.
The behaviour of the participants, during and after the user test is studied in the process of
determining the differences between an outdoor landmark and an indoor landmark. The user
test also helped further in determining the characteristics of an indoor landmark.
For defining indoor landmark, screening of the existing definitions of an indoor landmark by
preparing matrix tables of keywords of the definitions from the previous papers was performed.
Also, two landmark tables were prepared for two different routes of Technische Universität
München (TUM) main campus by describing the landmark category and the information related
to the landmark. A whole new and vivid definition is developed by considering the results of
previous research works and the results of user test conducted in the process of this thesis.
The flow chart for showing the procedure of deriving a landmark is developed by observation
of the participants’ behaviour during the user test, pre-test procedure results and also from
previous results of the research done on indoor landmark and indoor wayfinding.
As mentioned in the above paragraph, a pre-test is done by taking two different routes from
the TUM main campus into consideration to give the participants an idea of what an indoor
landmark is, what necessary information is to be provided while describing a route. This is
continued with a user test.
41.6 Thesis Structure
Chapter 2 of this thesis consists of the literature review on the previous scientific results i.e.
the previous scientific papers on indoor landmarks and indoor navigation are studied and a
literature review is given based on the results of the studied papers.
The next chapter 3 includes a landmark keywords table which is developed using the previous
definitions of indoor landmarks. Also, the chapter includes two other landmarks tables that
were developed to perform the user test of two different routes within the TUM main campus
building.
The fourth chapter of the thesis describes the user test and its analysis. By performing the user
test, the behaviour of the participants is analysed in attributing a particular structure to a
landmark, which further contributed in explaining about an indoor landmark, indoor navigation
and the characteristics of an indoor landmark.
Chapter 5 explains the thesis results which starts by defining an indoor landmark, followed by
determining the characteristics of an indoor landmark, comparison and differences between
an indoor and an outdoor landmark, a flow chart which describes the steps that can be followed
in order to derive a landmark and extraction of a set of potential landmarks.
Conclusions and further research that can be conducted in the field of indoor navigation in
described in chapter 6.
52 Literature Review and Scientific Background
Navigation is all about ascertaining one’s position, planning of a route from that position to a
destination and following the route. From day-to day navigation experience, it can be said that,
for planning of a route from one location to another, spatial knowledge is required. Spatial
cognition plays an important role in planning a route between two or more locations. According
to Denis, M. and Loomis, JM. (2007), spatial cognition refers to the acquisition, organization,
utilization, and revision of knowledge about the spatial environments. These capabilities
enable humans to manage basic and high-level cognitive tasks in everyday life which include
navigating indoors as one of the main tasks. Researchers have been working on indoor
navigation focusing on various aspects along with spatial cognition. These aspects include
visual salience, structural salience, semantic salience, cognitive model of indoor environment,
representation of indoor places, and several others. In the following sub-chapters, a clear
elaboration of these aspects are given one after the other, initiating with the importance of
spatial cognition for wayfinding.
2.1 Spatial Cognition for Wayfinding
Spatial cognition researches have shown that humans often need landmarks for an easy and
successful wayfinding and when indoor scenario is considered, the indoor navigation systems
are required to contain landmark information to improve their usability. From the research work
by Wang, RF. and Brockmole, JR. (2003); Hölscher, C. et al. (2006), it is stated that people in
buildings can hardly maintain a sense of global orientation, they also tend to assume the same
configuration on different floors, and get confused when floors change. From this, it can be
said that wayfinding in unfamiliar buildings is never an easy task. Therefore, during way-
finding, people need to build up mental maps, reason a route plan, re-orientate and keep the
right direction (Lyu, H. et al., 2015). They may lose their path, whenever a mistake takes place.
These mistakes may occur due to unconventional architectural design, poorly designed sign
system and numbering system. Navigation systems with automatic routing function shall be
useful for way finders. Landmarks are needed to increase the usability of navigation systems
(Gluck, M., 1991).
Many landmark based indoor navigation applications have been reported, but most of them
use pre-defined landmarks, while only a few of them considered landmark selection process
(Lyu, H. et al., 2015). In the already mentioned publication, Lyu et al. attempted to enrich the
landmark concept with theories on cognition, affordance and space syntax by proposing
6several salience indicators and a computational method for the extraction of indoor landmarks
from a geo-database. The paper gave a conclusion that indoor navigation is still on its early
stage.
Knowledge about human spatial cognition is very important for explaining, predicting and
understanding people’s behaviour in a geographic space (Mark, D., 1997). Human spatial
cognition is a part of the interdisciplinary research area of cognitive science. Researchers from
many academic disciplines, such as psychology, linguistics, anthropology, philosophy, and
computer science investigate about mind, reason, experience, and people’s
conceptualizations of the world in which they live (Lakoff, G., 1987). In particular, cognitive
science deals with the study of human intelligence in all of its forms, from perception and action
to language and reasoning. The exercise of intelligence is called cognition (Osherson, D. and
Lasnik, H., 1990).
Mark et al. (1999) present a hypothetical information flow model for spatial and geographical
cognition. It consists of four stages: 1) acquisition of geographical knowledge, 2) mental
representations of geographical knowledge, 3) knowledge use, and 4) communication of
geographical information. Spatial cognition refers to both perceptual and conceptual processes
involved in understanding the physical environment. Therefore, wayfinding theories need to
integrate a link between perception and cognition if they want to serve as plausible accounts
of people’s everyday experience (Allen, G., 1999).
2.1.1 Navigational Tasks and Communication of Navigational Information
Navigation has two fundamental tasks: wayfinding and motion. These tasks are performed
iteratively until people reach their destinations. The term ‘wayfinding’ was originally introduced
by Lynch, K. (1960). Golledge, R. (1999) described it as a purposive, directed and motivated
activity of determining and following a path or route between an origin and a destination. During
wayfinding in an unfamiliar environment, people cannot use an internal map but have to rely
on the external sources to satisfy their information needs (Gluck, M., 1991). Positioning and
re-orientation are two major parts of navigation. It is given in this paper that positioning takes
place when people need to check their location. Mental maps or external tools such as GPS
receiver or maps are often involved in positioning. Re-orientation takes place when people
face choices between different directions or routes. Landmarks are important in both of these
tasks. According to Golledge, R. (1999), basic geometry of space and its cognitive maps can
7be summarized in terms of points, lines, areas, and surfaces. Thus, wayfinding environment is
usually represented as route network and referenced with landmarks.
Findings in spatial cognition have shown that humans need landmarks for an easy and
successful wayfinding.
There are two different kinds of route directions to convey the navigational information to the
user, either in terms of description (verbal instructions) or by means of a depiction (route map).
According to Tversky, B. and Lee, P. (1999) the structure and semantic content of both is
equal. It is important to consider information needs because people trying to find their ways in
unfamiliar environments do not have a previously acquired mental representation. Therefore,
they depend on external information. Simulating people’s wayfinding behaviour in a cognitively
possible way requires the integration of structures for information perception and cognition in
the underlying model. Raubal, M. and Winter, S. (2002) used a cognizing agent to simulate
people’s wayfinding processes in unfamiliar buildings. The agent-based model consists of two
tiers: simulated states of the environment and simulated beliefs of the agent according to the
authors. The agent is modelled with state, an observation schema, a specific wayfinding
strategy, and common sense knowledge.
2.1.2 Knowledge in the World-Dependency on External Information
Wayfinding and orientation form integral parts of people’s daily lives. Many a times, we have
to find our ways through cities, through buildings, along streets and highways, etc. At times,
the environment to be navigated is unfamiliar. People visit the place for the first time and have
to find a goal without the help of a previously acquired mental map. Therefore, they depend on
external information or what Norman, D. (1988) calls knowledge in the world. Such knowledge
involves the environment and is communicated through signs, guidance systems, and
architectural clues. In many cases people find it difficult to perform wayfinding tasks in an
unfamiliar environment because they are not provided with adequate or sufficient knowledge
in the world. The main reason for environments being too complex to facilitate wayfinding is
deficiency of clues (Raubal, M. and Egenhofer, M., 1998). They either lack sufficient wayfinding
information or their architectures are poorly designed and therefore not readable.
Previous research focused on the development of computational models that simulate
wayfinding in familiar environments. Route-planning tasks are solved with the help of a
simulated cognitive map. During wayfinding in an unfamiliar environment people cannot use
8an internal map but have to rely on other sources to satisfy their information needs (Gluck, M.,
1991).
Human wayfinding research investigates the processes that take place when people orient
themselves and navigate through space. Theories try to explain how people find their ways in
the physical world, how they communicate directions, and how people’s verbal and visual
abilities influence wayfinding. Allen, G. (1999) and Golledge, R. (1999) describe wayfinding
behaviour as purposeful, directed, and motivated movement from an origin to a specific distant
destination that cannot be perceived directly by the traveller. Such behaviour involves
interactions between the traveller and the environment. Human wayfinding takes place in
large-scale spaces (Downs, R. and Stea, D., 1977; Kuipers, B., 1978). Such spaces cannot be
perceived from a single viewpoint, therefore people have to navigate through large-scale
spaces to experience them. Examples for large-scale spaces are landscapes, cities, and
buildings. Wayfinding tasks can be categorized according to their functional goals. Allen, G.,
(1999) distinguishes between travel with the goal of reaching a familiar destination, exploratory
travel with the goal of returning to a familiar point of origin, and travel with the goal of reaching
a novel destination. Raubal, M. (1997) focuses on the task of finding one’s way to a novel
destination in an unfamiliar environment. In such situations, people have to rely on symbolic
spatial information communicated to them through the environment. Key processes for this
type of communication relate to abilities such as matching real-world features against
knowledge schemas of those features and understanding the symbols commonly used to
represent real features (Golledge, R., 1999).
People’s spatial abilities mainly depend on the following four interactive resources: 1) percep-
tual capabilities, 2) fundamental information processing capabilities, 3) previously acquired
knowledge, and 4) motor capabilities (Allen, G., 1999). These abilities are a necessary
prerequisite for people to find a way from an origin point to a destination point. They are
supposed to use environmental information, representations of spatial knowledge, and move
through the environment. Wayfinding in a building is mainly concerned with the interactions
between a mobile observer and large stationary objects. The foundation for this class of spatial
abilities is sensitivity to perceptual information. Examples are obstacle avoidance and path
integration. As for the spatial abilities, the cognitive abilities also depend on the task given.
Finding one’s way in a street network (Timpf, S. et al., 1992; Car, A., 1996) uses a different
set of cognitive abilities than navigating from one room to another in a building (Gärling, T. et
al., 1983; Moeser, S., 1988).
Research on people’s wayfinding performance helped to establish practical guidelines on how
to design public buildings to facilitate wayfinding. Arthur, P. and Passini, R. (1990) introduced
9the term environmental communication (i.e., “transfer of orientation, wayfinding (direction), and
other information within the built environment by means of signs and other communications
devices or architectural features to enable people to reach destinations”), arguing that the built
environment and its parts should function as a communication device. They mention two major
aspects regarding the understanding of buildings: 1) a spatial aspect that refers to the total
dimensions of the building and 2) a sequential aspect that considers a building in terms of its
destination routes. Destination routes should eventually lead to the so-called destination
zones. These are groupings of similar destinations within buildings into clearly identifiable
zones (Arthur, P. and Passini, R., 1992). In order to facilitate wayfinding to such destination
zones the circulation system should be of a form people can easily understand.
2.2 Characterization of an Entity as a Landmark
Sorrows, M.E. and Hirtle, S.C. (1999) proposed three types of landmarks. The authors
presumed that the visual, semantic, and structural attraction of features in geographic
space determine their use as landmarks in human spatial reasoning and communication. The
description of the three types of attractions to characterize an entity as a landmark is given by
the authors as below:
Visual Attraction: Landmarks qualify as visually attractive if they have certain visual
characteristics such as a sharp contrast with their surroundings or a prominent spatial location.
The formal model given by the authors of this paper for landmark saliency includes four
measures regarding visual attraction: Façade area, shape, colour, and visibility.
 Façade Area: The façade area or simply, the front facing of an object is an important
property for determining its contrast to surrounding objects. People tend to easily notice
objects whose façade areas significantly exceed or fall below the façade areas of
surrounding objects. For example, figure 1 shows a building with a contrasting facade
area.
10Figure 1: Façade area of TUM Audimax
 Shape: Visual attraction of an object is also determined by its shape. Unorthodox
shapes like the shape of the office building of the fisheries department in Hyderabad
shown in figure 2, amidst conventional rectangle-like shapes strike one’s eyes.
Formally, specification of the shape measure of an object is done by considering its
shape factor and also the deviation of its shape from that of a rectangle. The shape
factor represents the proportion of height and width. For example, skyscrapers have a
high shape factor, whereas long and low buildings have a low shape factor. The value
of deviation is the difference between the area of the minimum-bounding rectangle of
the object’s façade and its façade area.
Figure 2: Office building of fisheries department, Hyderabad, India
11 Colour: An object can stand out from surrounding objects based on its colour. For
example, imagine a red fire department building in the midst of a set of grey buildings
or pink, yellow and green coloured buildings like seen in figure 3.
Figure 3: Pink, yellow and green coloured buildings having uniqueness of their own
 Visibility: The final property to be measured is the prominence of spatial location as
seen in figure 4, where the Rathaus building is located in the centre of the city. The
authors, Sorrows and Hirtle proposed to measure this property by calculating two-
dimensional visibility. Visibility is considered for the space used in the actual mobility
mode. It is assumed that visibility is limited by recognisability, for which reason a pre-
defined buffer zone limits the considered space (and reduces computational
complexity).
Figure 4: Rathaus at Marienplatz, Munich
12 Other Visual Properties: Other properties of an object, such as its texture and condition
also influence the contrast to surrounding objects as seen below in figures 5 and 6
respectively. The texture of an object is often hard to identify, both from databases and
in the real world. The condition of an object refers to its age and cleanliness. According
to the authors, age is easy to determine from a database, but often very hard to guess
in the real world. For example, a building may be very old but due to a recent renovation
looks new. Cleanliness is a subjective measure and therefore hard to specify within
formal terms.

Figure 6: An old house with poor maintenance
13Semantic attraction: The authors’ notion of semantic attraction is similar to that of cognitive
attraction, which focuses on the meaning of a feature. Semantic measures for the formal model
of landmark saliency comprise cultural and historical importance of an object, and explicit
marks.
Structural attraction: A landmark is structurally attractive if it plays a major role or has a
prominent location in the structure of the spatial environment. Examples are intersections and
down-town plazas.
The definitions which are seen in the following chapter 2.3 are defining an indoor landmark
based on the characteristics stated in chapter 2.2.
2.3 Analysis of Existing Definitions of an Indoor Landmark
As already mentioned above, the definition of landmark is given by Lynch, K. (1960) as an
external point of reference that is not part of a route. Sorrows, M.E. and Hirtle, S.C. (1999)
defined landmarks as points that serve multiple purposes in wayfinding as organizing concept
which help people build up structured spatial knowledge representation and navigational tools.
According to Raubal, M. and Winter, S. (2002), navigation services communicate optimal
routes to users by providing sequences of instructions for these routes. Each single instruction
guides the way finder from one decision point to the next. The instructions are based on
geometric data from the street network, which is typically the only dataset available.
Presson, CC. and Montello, DR. (1988) proposed two kinds of landmarks based on wayfinding
activity, i.e. route decision landmarks, which are cues for turnings at decision points; route
maintenance points, which help to keep human on the routes.
As indoor landmark extraction is still on its early age, analysing such theories as mentioned
above would contribute in developing new theories for indoor cartography. Existing cognitively
based computational models for wayfinding focus primarily on the exploration of mental
representations rather than focusing on the information needs for wayfinding. It is important to
consider information needs because people trying to find their ways in unfamiliar environments
depend on external information as they do not have a previously acquired mental
representation. Lyu, H. et al. (2015) have shown that automatic selection of indoor landmark
is still on its early stage and a quality-measurement system is missing.
14A taxonomy proposed by Montello, DR. (1993) is introduced to help build this cognitive model
for indoor wayfinding. The taxonomy contains three levels of indoor objects: figural level
objects, vista level objects and environmental level objects. The description for these three
levels is given in the following chapter.
2.3.1 Figural, Vista and Environmental Level Entities
In the year 1993, Montello, DR. proposed definitions for figural, vista and environmental level
as follows:
Figural level denotes objects that are smaller than or nearly equal to the size of the human
body. People can directly perceive their properties or manipulate them from one place without
any location change.
Vista level denotes objects that are larger than the human body but can be visually perceived
in a single view. Few examples of vista level objects include simple rooms and corridors.
Environmental level contains objects that are significantly larger than the human body. To
completely perceive them, people have to make a considerable position change. Objects at
this level include irregularly shaped rooms, floor configurations and entire buildings.
These classifications helped in performing the user test and deriving the landmarks. Also, what
category of objects are most likely to satisfy the definition of a landmark will be seen further in
this thesis.
2.3.2 Salience of a Landmark
The selection and the assessment of landmarks especially in large scale indoor environments
is not very frequently examined. It is a fact that pedestrians prefer route instructions based on
landmarks since they are considered to be the most effective way to communicate navigation
instructions (Ohm, C. et al., 2014). The importance of this type of navigational aid is well
reported. Ohm, C. et al. (2014) findings on a user study conducted in the University of
Regensburg by assessing the visual attraction of objects with an eye tracker show that
functional landmarks like doors and stairs are most likely to be looked at and named as an
15indoor landmark. They could also prove that measuring visual salience is not enough to identify
landmarks with regard to the use in a pedestrian navigation system. Previous spatial
knowledge is crucial for way finding decisions and thus for selecting landmarks (May, A.J. et
al., 2003).
A landmark's salience is considered to result from visual, semantic and structural properties,
accompanied by its advance visibility (Sorrows, M.E. and Hirtle, S.C., 1999; Winter, S., 2003;
Winter, S. et al., 2004). However, it is still an open question, what are the features of an object
that are most essential to assess its suitability to serve as a landmark. This is problematic
when indoor environments are considered. Instructions require a higher density of landmarks
since the route usually contains more turns but then there is a smaller choice of landmark
categories despite the high diversity of distinct objects available (Brunner-Friedrich, B. and
Radoczky, V., 2006; Radoczky, V., 2007). Even though there is strong evidence that people
tend to get lost indoors more easily than outdoors, there is still a lack of scalable and practical
solutions for navigation systems in large-scale indoor environments (Brunner-Friedrich, B. and
Radoczky, V., 2006). According to the user study conducted in the University of Regensburg
as mentioned above, visual attraction of a landmark does not seem to be the most important
feature when it is used for indoor pedestrian navigation systems and show that functional
landmarks are most suitable for indoor guidance. Elevators, escalators, stairs, doors, plants,
information boards and signs were selected as potential landmarks and were later assigned to
one of the four landmark categories (Ohm, C. et al., 2014): 1) Architecture: pillars and fronts,
2) Function: doors, stairs and elevators, 3) Information: signs and posters and 4) Furniture:
tables, chairs, benches and vending machines
The above mentioned categories are not used in this thesis but the examples that are given
for the four landmark categories are used as indoor landmarks.
2.3.3 Wayfinding Instructions using Landmarks
According to Raubal, M. and Winter, S. (2002), navigation services communicate optimal
routes to users by providing sequences of instructions for these routes. Each single instruction
guides the way finder from one decision point to the next. These instructions are based on
geometric data from the street network, which is typically the only dataset available to us, as
already mentioned. Raubal, M. and Winter, S. (2002), focus on enriching such wayfinding
instructions with local landmarks. The main challenges are the automatic definition and
16extraction of appropriate salient features, i.e., landmarks, from the available datasets. Among
the different meanings of landmark is that of an object or structure that marks a locality and is
used as a point of reference (Merriam, G. and Webster, N., 2001).
Allen, G. and Golledge, R. (1999), describe wayfinding behaviour as purposeful, directed, and
motivated movement from an origin to a specific distant destination, which cannot be directly
perceived by the traveller. Such behaviour involves interactions between the traveller and the
environment. Human wayfinding takes place in large-scale spaces (Deakin, A., 1996; Kuipers,
B., 1978). Such spaces cannot be perceived from a single viewpoint. Therefore, people have
to navigate through large-scale spaces to experience them. Examples for large-scale spaces
are landscapes, cities, and buildings. The authors also say that people use various spatial,
cognitive, and behavioural abilities to find their ways. These abilities are a necessary
prerequisite to use environmental information or representations of spatial knowledge about
the environment. The spatial abilities are task-dependent and seem to involve mainly four
interactive resources: 1) perceptual capabilities, 2) information-processing capabilities, 3)
previously acquired knowledge, and 4) motor capabilities (Allen, G., 1999). Allen distinguishes
further between three categories of wayfinding tasks: 1) travel with the goal of reaching a
familiar destination, 2) exploratory travel with the goal of returning to a familiar point of origin,
and 3) travel with the goal of reaching a novel destination.
Landmarks are used in mental representations of space (Habel, C., 1988) and in the
communication of route directions (Michon, P.E. and Denis, M., 2001; Deakin, A., 1996;
Werner, S. et al., 1997). Studies show that landmarks are selected for route directions
preferably at decision points (Maaß, W. and Schmauks, D., 1998; Lovelace, K. et al., 1999).
Another study (Lynch, K., 1960) has shown that mapped routes enriched with landmarks at
decision points lead to better guidance, or less wayfinding errors, than routes without
landmarks. Lynch characterizes the quality of a landmark by its singularity, where singularity
is bound to a clear form, contrast to the background, and a prominent location. The principal
factor is the figure-background contrast (Metzger, W., 1936). The contrast can be produced by
any property, such as uniqueness in form or function in the local or global neighbourhood.
Sorrows, M.E. and Hirtle, S.C. (1999), categorize landmarks into visual (visual contrast),
structural (prominent location), and cognitive (use, meaningful) ones, depending on their
dominant individual quality. A landmark will be stronger the more qualities it possesses. The
authors had a basic assumption that route directions enriched by local landmarks are easier
to understand than the ones which are only direction and distance based.
172.4 Summary
In this chapter, an overview of the current status of indoor navigation is provided, based on the
theories developed and research done till date. The most importantly discussed topics were
spatial cognition for wayfinding, analysis of the existing definitions of landmark and
characterization of an entity as a landmark. Spatial cognition for wayfinding briefly implies that
spatial knowledge attaining should be given utmost importance for wayfinding and navigation.
The existing definitions on landmark provided certain keywords defining landmarks such as
external points of reference, points serving multiple purposes in wayfinding, entities that help
in route decision and route maintenance. In characterizing an entity as a landmark, the
previous theories on landmarks have provided with information that could help differentiate
between objects and objects that could be landmarks. Visual, semantic, and structural
attraction of features in geographic space determine their use as landmarks in human spatial
reasoning and communication which helps in better navigation.
To contribute more to the literature review, a user test is done. A pre-user test, in which
developing of a new definition of an indoor landmark takes place, as described in detail in the
next chapter.
183 Developing a New Definition for an Indoor Landmark
After analysing the papers and drawing conclusions of what the papers defined an indoor
landmark to be, a keyword table is formed to develop a new definition of an indoor landmark.
The table is described in the chapter 3.1 and chapter 3.2 shows the two tables that were used
for the pre-test in order to develop the new vivid definition of an indoor landmark. This pre-test
was further performed with the two routes to derive the landmarks that fall along both the routes
and to analyse the characteristics of these landmarks. This was necessary to verify the output
of pre-user test with that of the results of user test and draw conclusions on what characteristics
makes an entity to be defined as an indoor landmark.
3.1 Keywords for Indoor Landmark Definition
As seen below, the table is derived from the previous definitions given on landmark from
various authors namely, Lynch, K. (1960), Sorrows, M.E. and Hirtle, S.C. (1999), Merriam, G.
and Webster, N. (2001). These authors defined landmark clearly as already analysed in the
previous chapter. The keywords of these definitions were selected as these words explain the
term landmark, which helped in the further research of this thesis to develop a whole new
definition for an indoor landmark.
Authors Definition of a Landmark Keywords
Lynch, K. (1960) A landmark is an external point of External point of reference
reference that is not a part of a
route.
Sorrows, M.E. and Landmarks are points that serve Wayfinding, Structured
Hirtle, S.C. (1999) multiple purposes in wayfinding as spatial knowledge
organizing concept which help
people build up structured spatial
knowledge representation and
navigational tools.
Merriam, G. and Landmark is that of an object or Locality marker, Point of
Webster, N. (2001) structure that marks a locality and reference
is used as a point of reference.
Table 1: Table for keywords of indoor landmark definition by various authors
19As it can be seen from the above table, the keywords that were used in defining a landmark
are external points, wayfinding, structured spatial knowledge, locality marker and point of
reference.
External points are the entities that are not a part of the route taken. These could serve as
landmarks to maintain the route. Maintaining the route while navigating is extensively required
and that makes landmarks as important as reaching the destination.
Wayfinding and structured spatial knowledge are related to spatial cognition and are the most
important aspects of navigation. This is discussed in chapter 2.1.
As the keyword locality marker explains for itself, it is any entity that helps in remembering and
recollecting a particular locality by making a mental representation of a landmark in a given
geographical area. This marker is also used or known as a point of reference.
Deriving of the above mentioned keywords from previous definitions contributed in developing
a new vivid definition by giving clues about what kind of entities could possibly be considered
as landmarks.
The next sub-chapter, includes two landmark tables of two different routes taken from the TUM
main campus building. These tables were developed to discover more landmarks that relate
to the keywords derived in the table above. To develop these tables, a pre-test was performed
by the author of this thesis along the two selected routes, which happen to be the routes
including prominent locations like library, student service centre, lecture halls, snack automats
etc. To give the participants of the user test an idea of some of the potential landmarks,
landmark categories, giving information about the selected landmark, was the motive to
perform this pre-test.
3.2 Landmark Tables
In this sub-chapter, the two landmark tables are given. The pre-test was performed with two
routes as a clear elaboration of the indoor landmark concept was necessary to explain the
participants before performing the user test. These two routes happen to be different from each
other containing various entities as landmarks. These landmarks could vary from one route to
another in any of the indoors of a structure based on its functionality. For example, landmarks
in a shopping mall, airport and university building are different from one another.
20The TUM was used as an example building for performing the user test as it is highly complex,
wayfinding is not that easy and the building contains a good number of potential landmarks.
Additionally, the chosen user group is familiar with the campus building.
The first route starts from the main entrance of the TUM main building, passing through the
library, the goal is to reach room no. 0714. This particular route was selected as it had
prominent entities that could be identified as landmarks like elevators, paintings, fire
extinguishers, staircases etc.
The second route starts from administrative office (Student Service Centre) in the main campus
building of TUM, via Carl von Linde Hörsaal to the Cafeteria on the terrace of the main building.
The selection of this route was made based on the important landmarks the route has like
lecture halls, elevators and a little complexity it causes.
The tables below show a total of 17 and 14 landmarks respectively for first and second route
Along with the landmarks, information related to the landmark and the category into which the
landmark falls are given in the table.
3.2.1 Landmarks of Route 1
The table 2 below gives information about the landmarks that were selected along the route
from Main Entrance (Arcisstraße 21) to room no. 0714 via Library. As it can be seen from the
table, the details that are belonging to the landmarks are also given like the information content
of the landmark and the category of landmarks a selected entity belongs to. A total of 17
landmarks could be selected for this route.

Table 2: Pre-tested route 1 from Main entrance (Arcisstraße 21) to room no. 0714 via Library
22As it can be seen from the above table, most of the landmarks fall into the category of vista
level objects. It is always important that landmarks belong to either vista level or environmental
level objects as figural level objects could be replaced from one position to another (chapter
2.2).
As can be seen in table 1, trash boxes of different colours, staircases, WC etc. were selected
as indoor landmarks. Trash boxes were selected as landmarks because of the colour of the
boxes. As seen in chapter 2.2, an entity can be identified as a landmark based on its colour
varying from its surroundings. Similarly, a staircase could be a landmark based on its visibility,
which is one of the characteristics to define an entity as a landmark. In addition to this, coffee
machine and snack automat contribute to the category of landmarks as these entities are
commonly used and are easily recognizable. A fire extinguisher could be considered as a
landmark as it commonly seen in every indoor structure in almost all the floors, also it is easy
to recognize because of its red colour. Most of the landmarks derived in the above table exhibit
the characters that were analysed from the literature review.
3.2.2 Landmarks of Route 2
Below, the table 3 shows the landmarks that fall along the route from Administrative Office
(Student Service Centre) via Carl von Linde Hörsaal to Terrace Cafeteria. Also, information
regarding the landmark and the category of the landmark is also provided. A total of 14
landmarks were extracted along this route.

Table 3: Pre-tested route 2 from Administrative office to Carl von Linde Hörsaal to Cafeteria
Similar to route 1, route 2 also has most of the landmarks that fall into the category of vista
level objects. The landmarks derived for route 2 are similar to that of route 1 except for a few
such as elevators and Carl von Linde Hörsaal lecture hall. Elevator is described as a landmark
because of its functionality as recognisability. The lecture hall Carl von Linde Hörsaal is a
landmark because of its semantic attraction. It is convenient to find objects than are larger than
the size of the human body than smaller objects. Vista level and environmental level entities
are easier to locate than to locate figural level objects.
Completion of the pre-user test along with its results now lead to the user test in chapter 4,
where the user group perform wayfinding and locate the landmarks that fall along the two
routes where the pre-user test was performed.
244 User Study for Indoor Wayfinding
This chapter holds a user test in order to answer the research questions mentioned in chapter
1.4.2. To perform this user test, students of M.S. Cartography, 2016 intake were taken into
consideration. All the 20 students of this intake were asked to participate in the user test.
However, at the end 14 students participated but the results can be considered as acceptable.
Before starting with the user test, a presentation describing the term landmark, idea of the user
test, drive through the idea, the routes to be tested and the execution procedure was given to
the participants. The entire presentation is given in the annex (chapter 8.1). The hypothesis
definition was not given because a proof was required for the hypothesis definition and also to
avoid influencing the user group. Instead of the hypothesis definition, a simple definition of
landmark was chosen to explain the participants the overall concept of identifying an entity as
a landmark as given in figure 7 below.
Figure 7: Landmark definition given to the participants of the user test
254.1 Task Description and User Group
After performing a pre-test of the two routes as mentioned in chapter 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, the user
test was ready to be conducted. To give the students an insight about the thesis goals and
explain what indoor navigation is, a presentation was given as described above and the pre-
test result sheets were handed over to the participants.
Task of this user test is to derive landmarks along the two given routes, analyse the
characteristics that makes the selected entities as landmarks, identify the differences between
an indoor landmark and an outdoor landmark and identify already given landmarks from the
results of the pre-tested routes. After the user test, a questionnaire is handed over to the
participants of the user test to fill in. The results of this questionnaire are further analysed to
study the knowledge gained by the participants about indoor wayfinding and indoor landmark.
Table 4: Division of groups and tasks for the user test
As seen in the above table, the user test is conducted with 14 students. These 14 students are
divided into 2 groups of 7 participants each. Among these 14 students, 8 were female and 6
were male, aged 22-27 on an average. The background of most of the participants was
Geography, Surveying and Geo-Information. The students of group 1 analyse the pre-tested
route 1 and perform wayfinding for new route 2 and vice-versa as seen from the figure above.
The pre-tested route was given before performing the new route wayfinding in order to verify
if the participants were influenced by the landmarks that were derived during the pre-test.
Each task takes about 15-20 minutes. To complete the user test, the time consumed is around
1 hour 10 minutes.
26The questionnaire to be filled in by the participants is mentioned in appendix user test material
under chapter 8.2. This questionnaire includes queries that are related to the participants’
previous experience and knowledge on indoor wayfinding and navigation, the knowledge they
have gained after performing the user test about indoor navigation and how it differs from
outdoor navigation.
Students’ knowledge about Navigation and landmarks before the user test:
Before starting the user test, students were asked to give their ideas on landmarks. Most of
the students with similar background like Geology, Geography, Geological engineering,
Surveying, Urban engineering had an idea of what a landmark is and what factors contribute
for a feature to be a landmark. The bar chart in figure 8 below shows the students and their
educational background information more precisely.

4.2 User Study Motive
The motive of performing this user test is to contribute to the existing theories on indoor
landmark and discover new landmarks from users’ perspective. Additionally, the user test also
aims to analyse the definition of a landmark and factors influencing the derivation of a
landmark. This will be derived based on the behaviour of the participants while performing the
user test. Additionally, the test aims to describe the differences between an indoor and an
outdoor landmark. This would help the future researchers to develop vivid explanations and
contribute more precisely to the field of indoor navigation. Also, the user test helps in analysing
how wayfinding behaviour is exhibited in indoor environment by observing the areas of focus
by the participants taking part in the user test. Based on the behaviour of the participants in
the user test, a flowchart is derived depicting how a landmark can be extracted from a given
geographical data.
A flow chart in figure 10 shows graphical depiction of the procedure to be followed to fulfil the
motive of the user test.

4.3 Execution of the User Test
For the user test to be executed, the procedure followed is as follows:
There are two routes given as described in chapter 3.2 in which the participants are supposed
to find their way and locate the landmarks which takes 15-20 minutes for each group.
While performing the identification of landmarks from the pre-tested routes, each group
exhibited a behaviour of analysation which further helped them to locate the landmarks of a
new route. Although, for not all the students it was easy to locate the landmarks. The students
who had previous experience of performing such user test performed the task with an ease
while the other faced difficulties finding the landmarks and the route to be taken. To ease the
students facing difficulty, a few wayfinding instructions were given like which route to take.
While the choice of elevator available, some of the students opted to find their way through the
staircase. The other users who hadn’t opted for the elevator and the students who opted to
use the elevator, both the groups seemed to find the consecutive destination in a similar
manner.
Most of the students found route 1 to be easier than route 2 as route 1 leads to one of the
lecture halls of the students that they already know. The other route 2 was quite unfamiliar
29route which caused the difficulty. The participants are also asked to draw the route maps of
the new route for which they are finding way and landmarks. All the participants drew the maps
of the respective routes taken while only some of the maps were considered which were
visually attractive and informative as visual attraction plays an important role in defining an
entity as a landmark. The considered maps are shown in annex 8.3.
The anticipated results were derived based on the pre-user test and described in the following
chapter 4.4
The user test was completed with the filled-in questionnaires, where the next task was to
analyse the results of the user test (chapter 5).
4.4 Anticipated Results of the User Test
The anticipated results were derived as a result of the pre-user test and to answer the research
questions as mentioned in 1.4.2.
The expected results should ideally contain a minimum of 10 landmarks in each given route.
In addition to the landmark, the participants are also expected to provide information about/of
the landmark or wayfinding instruction considering the pre-tested route as an example.
The given questionnaire is expected to be filled out by every participant from which the
characteristics of indoor landmarks could be derived along with the development of a vivid
definition of an indoor landmark.
As a result, the output would have the definition of the landmark, differences between an indoor
and an outdoor landmark and wayfinding, a flow chart on how a landmark can be extracted
from a given geography, characteristics of indoor landmarks and examples of a set of indoor
landmarks.
One of the results of maps drawn by a student who took part in the user test is given in figure
11.
30Figure 11: Route map depiction of route 2 by one of the users
The route map shows route 2. From the map, it can be seen that the participant was
comfortable using arrows, wayfinding instructions and names of the entities to navigate
through an unknown route rather than using symbols for landmarks.
A set of potential landmarks are also derived both from pre-user test and user test. Most of the
participants derived the landmarks with ease while for a few it was difficult as they lacked
previous experience of wayfinding and identification of landmarks in an indoor structure. A few
of the indoor landmarks extracted included trash boxes (figure 12), information boards (figure
13), staircases and lecture halls with room numbers.
31Figure 12: Trash boxes: figural level objects of indoor landmarks
Although trash boxes fall under the category of figural level objects, they can still be considered
as landmarks where there are no other potential sources of landmarks or these can also be
additional reference points apart from the main landmark.
Figure 13: Information board showing direction for different point of interests
In figure 13, an information board can be seen that shows 6 different destinations along the
straight path from its position. Information boards, though belong to figural level category of
the indoor objects, can be considered as landmarks because the information that they contain
is most likely to not get replaced, for example, lecture halls, auditoriums and other important
rooms. Therefore, information boards form a very good source of indoor landmarks.
32Indoor landmarks could be varying from one indoor structure to another. The derived indoor
landmarks in this thesis are examples of landmarks in a university building. Landmarks could
be different in an airport, in a hospital and in a shopping complex. For example, in a hospital,
landmarks could be emergency ward (figure 14), reception, a vending machine etc. In a
shopping mall, one could use the shop names, WC’s, food court (figure 15), seating area as
landmarks. Similarly, at an airport, landmarks could be different attractions like trees (figure
16), gate numbers (figure 17), shops, WC’s, baggage claim, etc.
Figure 14: Emergency ward in a hospital building
Figure 15: Food court at Century City
33Figure 16: Inside Changi International Airport, Terminal 3, Singapore
Figure 17: Gate numbers as landmarks in airports
The landmarks derived from the user test relate to the landmarks mentioned in the paragraph
above in their characteristics. For example, the emergency room board in a hospital building
is similar to the information board that is derived while performing the user test, the food court
is similar to the terrace cafeteria which is the destination point of route 2. The landmarks
34derived in different indoor structures might be different but they do relate with each other based
on the characteristics they own.
While the above mentioned scenario is an anticipation of the results, with the completion of the
user test, the next chapter 5 is about the results that are derived based on the literature review,
pre-user test and user test conducted.
355 Results and Discussion
In the previous chapter, the description of the user test and the procedure of how the user test
is carried out was described. In this chapter, the results of the user test performed is presented
along with the analysis of the findings and the further research that can be done by considering
the results of the user test.
5.1 Questionnaire Results
The questionnaire’s results are given along with the questions asked below. The questionnaire
is given in appendix 8.2. The questionnaire starts with some general questions like gender,
age, country of origin and previous educational background followed by 12 questions focusing
on the previous experience of the participants with navigating indoors and outdoors and other
related questions as seen below:
The result of question 1 (user test experience) is already explained in chapter 4.1.
Question 2: Difficulty level experienced by the students for locating a landmark in an indoor
structure:
Most of the students experienced moderate level of difficulty to locate a landmark in an indoor
structure until they performed this user test. A very few students have experienced low level
difficulty and these students happened to have had similar background related to GIS and
Cartography.

36Question 3: In a typical day, how often does navigating indoors make you feel inconvenient?
The students have said that navigating in indoors made them feel inconvenient only when the
structure was a maze and huge. For small buildings, navigating was never a difficult task
because of the simple structure and planning.

Question 4: How often are printed maps used in an indoor environment?
When the students were asked about the pace of using printed maps in an indoor environment,
most of the students replied saying ‘sometimes’ while a few replied saying ‘rarely’. Usage of
maps in an indoor environment is based on the size and complexity of the indoor structure
which is why it is sometimes difficult to navigate indoors.

Question 6: Is navigation easier in an outdoor environment or an indoor environment?
The questionnaire result shows that some students find navigating in an outdoor environment
is easier because of the ease to locate landmarks and already available geographical data and
output media while some find navigating in an indoor environment easier.

Question 7: How easy was it to locate the landmarks of a new route in the TUM main building
after looking and walking through the pre-tested route locating the given landmarks?
38After having walked through the pre-tested route, it was moderate for some of the students to
locate the landmarks in a new route while for some students it was easier as they possessed
previous knowledge about the subject area.

Question 8: Through this user test, did you gain new knowledge about indoor navigation and
indoor landmarks?
To this question, all the students answered saying ‘yes’, which is proved in other questions of
the questionnaire related to indoor wayfinding and indoor landmark.
Question 9: Understanding of the term indoor landmark after the user test by the students:
After the user test, the students gave different descriptions of their understanding of the term
indoor landmark, which are the following:
 An indoor landmark is a distinctive marker. (Given by 2 students)
 An entity that allows us to clearly identify the way that is required to be taken.
 An easily identified object which should serve as orientation object related with a
specific place.
 A prominent feature of an indoor especially those that cannot be moved, like stairs.
(Given by 2 students)
 A well recognizable feature that can be used for orientation (can be a sign, an
architectonic feature, furniture and similar).
 An object that is either prominent or conspicuous that can serve as a guide for finding
our way. For indoors, it could be staircase or a hallway.
39 An indoor landmark is a reference point (object, entity) that helps us to orient in an
indoor space. (Given by 3 students)
 A distinctive entity which is visually/ spatially dominant and/or informative for spatial
orientation.
 A recognizable feature in the scene that is a potential reference point.
From these definitions, an indoor landmark can be explained as an easily recognizable entity
that is visually and spatially dominant and is also a distinctive marker that helps orientation
when an indoor space is considered.
Although 14 students filled in the questionnaire, only 9 definitions were taken into consideration
as the other 5 definitions were similar to the other 9 definitions mentioned above.
Question 10 and 11: Difference between an indoor and an outdoor landmark:
The user test completion proceeded with questions of differences between an indoor and an
outdoor landmark to the students. The feedback included that there are significant differences
between an indoor and an outdoor landmark by most of the students. The responses given are
as follows:
 Types of features, example: staircase vs. traffic light. (Given by 4 students)
 The indoor landmarks are more limited and of different type (more sophisticated) and
concentrated in much smaller area.
 For indoor landmarks could be parts of an interior structure and for outdoor landmarks,
entities from outdoor environment are used. (Given by 4 students)
 The indoor landmarks rather tend to be smaller objects while as an outdoor landmark
can also be served by a building or a nature object such as trees, hills, water bodies
etc. (Given by 4 students)
 Outdoor landmarks need to hold up or be visible against potential distractions outside.
There may be fewer distinctive interior landmarks i.e. no names for hallways the way
we have for streets.
Therefore, it can be said that an indoor landmark differs from an outdoor landmark based on
visibility, types of feature, information content and availability of options for selection of entities
as landmarks.
The last question 12 had general character and the participants were asked if they are
available or willing to volunteer in a similar user test in future and all the participants agreed.
40As mentioned in the above question, only 5 results were taken into consideration out of 14 as
the other results were similar and included the same content as the 5 results chosen.
In the following chapter 5.2, the results of the user test are described in detail based on the
analysis of the questionnaire results and the route maps drawn by the participants, pre-user
test results and findings of literature review. These answer the research questions of this
thesis.
5.2 Thesis Results
In this chapter, the results for all the research questions mentioned in the chapter 1.4.2 are
given initiating with the definition of an indoor landmark as follows:
5.2.1 Definition of an Indoor Landmark
The definition for an indoor landmark is derived from the results of user test and based on the
keywords derived from the previous definitions of landmarks as described in the table 3.1.
From the results obtained and the study done, the definition is given as:
An ‘Indoor Landmark’ is a distinctive point of interest that is visually, spatially dominant
and informative for spatial orientation in the inside of a structure which could be a route
maintenance point, an external point of reference or a route decision point that can
either help the person to navigate and explore inside an indoor structure or that helps
to reach the desired point of interest.
The above definition explains that an indoor landmark can be any object that is attractive like
paintings as shown in figure 26 or dull with reference to its surroundings and is spatially
dominant. It also needs to be informative like information boards in university buildings as
shown in figure 30. A landmark can be used to maintain a taken route, as a point of reference
to navigate or to decide the route to be taken which helps in finding way in the indoor structure.
5.2.2 Characteristics of an Indoor Landmark
41Characteristics of an indoor landmark can be defined as a feature or a quality belonging
typically to the category of indoor entities that serves in identifying them as landmarks. Apart
from the characteristics mentioned in chapter 2.2., the additional characteristics that make an
indoor entity eligible to be considered as a landmark are as follows:
Uniqueness: an entity should be clear in its form to serve as a landmark, i.e. it should be
unique among its surroundings. More like an irregularly shaped building, a fountain in a big
shopping area etc.
Contrast: a structure or an entity that is considered as a landmark should be in contrast to the
background. For example, a textured façade building among plain façade buildings, a red
building amongst all the dull-shade coloured buildings, a sky-scraper amongst all the buildings
that are one to multi-floor.
Spatial prominence: the prominence of location also plays an important role in proving an
entity as a landmark. For instance, a landmark located in the city centre has more prominence
that the one located in a residential street. Although, this might differ depending on the area of
interest.
Cognition: another characteristic that plays an important role in determining an entity as a
landmark is its cognition. A landmark has to be a meaningful entity by itself. Any landmark
gains importance apart from satisfying the above mentioned characteristics if it is useful.
An entity can be assigned as a landmark if it satisfies the above mentioned characteristics
along with those mentioned in chapter 2.2.
5.2.3 Comparison between an Indoor and an Outdoor Landmark
Indoor and outdoor landmarks have many characteristics other than the known fact that indoor
landmarks are in the indoor of a structure and outdoor landmarks are in the outdoor
environment. Through the research done for the literature review and the user test performed,
the characteristics of an indoor and an outdoor landmark are derived which are as follows:
The first basic comparison done between an indoor and an outdoor landmark is the size of the
selected landmarks. Indoor landmarks, most of the times have smaller size when compared to
the outdoor landmarks which are larger or significantly larger in size. For example, while
walking in an indoor structure, a door, trash boxes, and corridors are considered as landmarks.
While in an outdoor environment, large buildings, sky scrapers, shopping malls, natural
attractions like trees, water bodies are considered as landmarks.
42Secondly, indoor landmarks are much limited when compared to the outdoor landmarks. While
selecting outdoor landmarks, one has many options such as high rise buildings, restaurants,
fountains, shopping malls, airports, trees, mountains, water bodies such as lakes, rivers and
many others. In indoors however, the options are less.
Outdoor landmarks need to hold up or be visible against potential distractions like tall trees,
rocky mountains, high-raised buildings. This is not necessarily true for indoor landmarks as
indoor landmarks are seen without any obstructions most of the times.
Outdoor landmarks are more distinctive when compared to indoor landmarks. For example,
outdoor landmarks are easier to locate like street name boards, flexi boards, malls and
restaurants. Where as in indoors, no corridor names are given, and not always information
boards are seen in indoors. There are less distinctive entities which makes navigating in
indoors a difficult task.
5.2.4 Indicators on Extracting Landmarks from Heterogeneous
Geographic Data
It is clear from today’s technology that navigation using technology has grown enormously over
the past decade. In this thesis, focus is given to indoor navigation as there is not as much
growth as there is for outdoor navigation. The reasons for this situation are various like
accuracy of location information, required output media and also cognition of the user as
discussed above. However, various theories that are now focusing on indoor landmarks and
indoor navigation are studied for the literature review of this thesis. From the recent
developments, it can be said that sooner there is going to be tremendous improvement even
in the field of indoor navigation.
Extraction of landmarks or identification of landmarks is an important task when it comes to
fulfilling the tasks of preparing a navigational equipment, let it be maps, smart phone apps,
GPS devices or any other. The differences are that outdoor navigation like street navigation
has exact locations and landmarks, it also has relevant media which supports the navigation.
Whereas, indoor navigation has no such drastic development as of yet.
However, there are certain indicators that could help the researches in locating landmarks from
a heterogeneous geographic data. A heterogeneous geographic data consists of different
categories of entities which include man-made structures like buildings, sky scrapers,
hospitals, shopping malls, airports, fountains etc. It also includes natural entities like trees,
water bodies, mountains etc.
43In indoor environment, navigation is not easier for the reasons like unconventional architectural
design, poorly designed sign system and numbering system. Despite these, the characteristics
discussed above would be helpful in extracting the landmarks in an indoor as well as outdoor
environments.
Cognition of the user is one of the most important indicator in determining an entity as a
landmark. Given a heterogeneous data, every person’s cognition is different to that of others.
From the user test conducted, a behaviour analysis was done is determining what factors make
an entity to be a landmark which are as follows:
Size of the object: most students happened to select larger objects varying in size from a
human body to the size of a room door as landmarks as they are easier to view and identify.
Colour of the object: colour of the entity plays an important role in description of an entity as
a landmark. Contrast of an object from its surroundings was one of the qualities that was
involved in the selection of the landmarks. Students selected trash boxes as landmarks.
Shape of the object: any object that is irregularly shaped gets a prominence which also helps
is defining an entity as a landmark. For example, staircase is not a regularly shaped structure
which is why it has such a cognitive importance as is selected by the students as a landmark
during the user test.
Texture of the object: texture of an object plays an important role in the cognitive world. This
also is a useful factor when locating indoor landmarks where there are not many prominent
entities. To give an example, paintings and elevators are selected as landmarks for an indoor
structure by the students which keep differing from one structure to another.
5.2.5 Extraction of a Set of Potential Landmarks
The results showed that most of the landmarks derived by the participants in the user test are
same as the landmarks derived during the process of pre-user test.
The 9 landmarks extracted are as follows:
441. Fire extinguishers
Fire extinguishers could be an indoor
landmark as it is seen in all the indoor
structures and is easy to locate because of
its colour and information content on the box
as seen in the figure 21.
Figure 24: Fire extinguisher: one of the most prominent
landmarks found in almost every indoor structure
2. Trash boxes
Although trash boxes fall under the category
of figural level objects, they can still be
considered as landmarks where there are no
other potential sources of landmarks or these
can also be additional reference points apart
from the main landmark as already
mentioned in 4.4. Trash boxes were
extracted as landmarks based on visual
attraction as they exhibit different colour
which differs from one structure to another.
Figure 25: Trash boxes: Identical because of the colours
453. Paintings
Paintings form unique landmarks as their
specification and way finding instruction is
easier to give because of its colours and
content. In indoors, paintings are most
commonly seen indoor entities. They are
found in university buildings, hospitals,
offices, shopping malls and also in houses.
Their prominence makes it an easy entity for
indoor wayfinding.
Figure 26: Paintings: Eye-capturing landmarks
4. Doors with door numbers or names
In university buildings, most commonly
occurring entities are lecture halls. These
could be with room numbers or with
specific names as seen in the figure 27.
Their identification is easier because of
the information content they hold.
Figure 27: Lecture halls with unique names- noticeable landmarks
465. Staircases
Staircases are the most commonly seen
indoor entities for a structure holding more
than ground floor. They form the basic indoor
landmark for any indoor structure.
Figure 28: Staircases- Most commonly found landmark
6. Snack automat machines
Snack automats are most common in
university buildings, hospitals and
airports. These are again easy-to-find
indoor landmark entities.
Figure 29: Snack Automats- Easily recognizable
477. Information boards
Informational boards are most useful for
wayfinding as they speak for themselves
with the information they hold. Not every
indoor structure has information boards,
but when these are present, they form the
most useful landmarks.
Figure 30: Information boards- Usually the most important landmarks
8. WC
Landmarks, as described in the above
chapters, can be derived based on usage.
One such entities are washrooms which are
the most commonly used rooms in an indoor
structure.
Figure 31: Washrooms, common landmark
489. Elevators
Elevators are seen in most indoor structure
holding more than three floors. The elevator
specifications might be different in different
countries. The characteristics that makes an
elevator essential for wayfinding are its
façade and texture as they from one indoor
structure to another.
Figure 32: Elevators
All the above listed landmarks were chosen both in pre-user test and user test. Although, some
of the landmarks selected by the participants in the user test like benches, construction
machinery were removed from the results as they are easily replaceable figural and vista level
objects respectively.
5.2.6 Flowchart for Extraction of Landmarks
To extract the landmarks, a procedure is required to analyse whether the extracted landmark
is appropriate or not, or to be said, if the landmark satisfies all the criterions that are to be
fulfilled by a potential landmark or not. Previously, in the sub-chapter 5.2.2, we have seen the
characteristics of an indoor landmark. Also, from the user test conducted, the behaviour of the
participants was analysed in the process of locating landmarks. With the knowledge of these
areas, a flowchart has been derived to show the steps of deriving a landmark which is as
follows:
1. Study the map of the building or the indoor location being chosen for navigation.
2. Analyse the structure based of the study of the map, to analyse means to look at the
symmetric/asymmetric nature of the structure.
3. Mark the most convenient route of all the routes to your destination from the map. Most
convenient route might be the shortest or the easiest according to the perception of the user.
494. Start navigating through the route and mark the potential landmarks you see through this
route. The potential landmarks, as discussed earlier should obey the characteristics of being
unique to its surroundings, be in contrast with the background, the landmark should be in a
prominent location and finally, it has to own a cognitive importance.
If an entity is chosen by the above mentioned procedure, then it definitely results in being a
potential landmark.
The flow chart is depicted graphically in figure 33.

structure
Analyse the structure for its
symmetry and asymmetry

routes possible

505.2.7 Figural Level, Vista Level and Environmental Level Landmarks
Previously in this thesis, it was discussed that indoor objects can be mapped on three levels
out of the four levels of a taxonomy proposed by Montello, DR. (1993).
Environmental level
Vista level
Figural level
Figure 34: Level of marking the indoor landmarks in descending order of selection
In the user test performed for this thesis, all of these three level landmarks were used. While
on the second round of the user test, a fire extinguisher, which belonged to the figural level
indoor objects was removed from its place where it was identified and marked as a landmark
during the first round of the user test.
Therefore, to avoid such a situation, marking of figural level objects as landmarks should be
avoided unless there is no other potential landmark in the surroundings. Strongest indoor
landmark fall under the categories of vista level and environmental level objects. Therefore,
the selection of landmarks should be done in the order as described in the figure 34.
516 Conclusions and Further Research
In the introduction of this thesis (chapter 1), various research questions were proposed and
the answers to those questions are given in the results chapter 5. In this chapter, the
conclusions are derived from the results and also further research ideas are presented.
6.1 Conclusions
In this thesis, several conclusions are drawn based on the literature review performed and also
the user test conducted. From the user test results, it is seen that an indoor landmark is an
entity that is visually, spatially dominant and informative for spatial orientation in the inside of
a structure. This entity could be a route maintenance point, an external point of reference or a
route decision point that can either help the person to navigate and explore inside an indoor
structure or that helps to reach the desired point of interest.
Also, these indoor objects are categorized into three: figural level, vista level and environmental
level. Based on the user test analysis, figural level objects do not fit to be marked as landmarks
as they are replaceable. So, a figural level object should be taken into consideration only in
the absence of vista and environmental level objects. An indoor landmark varies significantly
from an outdoor landmark based on shape, size, features and functionality.
The characteristics derived for an indoor landmark include uniqueness, contrast, spatial
prominence and cognition of an object. The derived landmarks in the pre-user test and user
test possessed these characteristics and thus, were selected as landmarks. The indicators that
helped in deriving these landmarks were the size, colour, shape and texture of the object.
The landmarks derived were visually dominant, informative and also spatially dominant. Some
of these landmarks were route maintenance points, some were route decision points and a
few were external points of reference. This proves that the derived landmarks justify the
developed definition of indoor landmark.
The goals and research questions of this thesis as mentioned in chapter 1.3 and sub-chapter
1.4.2 are determined in chapter 5.2 which proves that the goals of this thesis are achieved.
526.2 Further Research
In order to prove the wholeness of the developed definition of indoor landmark, a similar user
test can be conducted in different scenarios. For example, a user test can be performed in an
airport, a shopping mall and/or a hospital with audience from different backgrounds like
students of cartography and related fields, students from entirely different field of education,
general audience and with experts in the field of cartography. The results of these user tests
can be used to verify the wholeness of the definition.
In the previous chapters, it was seen that the reasons for poor navigation in indoors are
unconventional architectural design, poorly designed sign system and numbering system.
These can be improved by bringing betterment in the designing of the structures by
implementing conventional architectural designs, designing of efficient sign systems and
finding out methods to design easier indoor plans that will help in making navigation an easier
task in indoors.
