Abstract: The research problems addressed in this article pertain to the limited understanding
and insufficient availability of digital storytelling guidelines for elderly and physically impaired
individuals in museum presentations. The objective of this review is to explore digital storytelling
guidelines along with the latest technology in museums catering to older adults and those with
mobility impairments. This literature review included databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, and
Google Scholar, covering the period from 2000 to 2023. Researchers comprehensively examined and
employed content analysis to categorize all papers into three primary themes: (1) inclusive design
for museum presentations; (2) trends in technology for digital storytelling in museum presentations;
(3) guidelines for digital storytelling in museum presentations. This review article could enhance
understanding and promote diversity, accessibility, and motivation among two specific groups of
museum visitors, both onsite and online.

1. Introduction
Currently, many museums are embracing concepts centered around fostering visitor
engagement and inclusive design principles [1–3] while prioritizing new target audi-
ences [4]. Despite the positive development represented by the adoption of inclusive design
approaches, museums face challenges in effectively engaging older adults and individuals
with physical impairments, as it pertains to addressing their unique programming require-
ments. Additionally, there is a noticeable lack of scholarly literature and research focused
on examining museum experiences and technology trends relevant to older adults and
people with physical disabilities [5].
Historically, museums have often overlooked older adults, treating them as ordinary
visitors [6–8]. However, with the global population’s average age on the rise and advance-
ments in medical care enabling longer and healthier lives, older adults have become a
significant consumer demographic with considerable disposable income. They possess
the financial means to access essential support services and facilities, including medical
personnel and wheelchair ramps [6].
People with physical disabilities, constituting approximately 10% of the world’s popu-
lation, are a substantial demographic [9,10]. Research indicates that this group comprises
extremely loyal customers who actively seek establishments providing accessible options
meeting their requirements [7,9,11,12].
Furthermore, studies reveal that most museums globally present historical information
in overly formal, academic, antiquated, and excessively high tech formats. Such environ-

ments and technologies are not suitable for all individuals, especially seniors and disabled
people in need of special care [13,14].
In seeking strategies to enhance the engagement of these groups, this research pro-
poses the use of the digital storytelling method. This method is widely employed to
elucidate various forms of content, excluding direct advertising, such as novels, films,
narratives, presentations, and interactives through digital platforms [15–19]. According to
Ohler [18], digital storytelling is a form of media that integrates various media types into a
unified narrative using digital technology. However, this introduces a research problem for
certain reasons.
There is currently a limited availability of specific digital storytelling guidelines and
information about technology for the elderly and those with mobility disabilities in the
context of museum presentations and exhibitions [1,6,7,10,13,14]. Most digital storytelling
guidelines present about general purpose [20–22], and interactive multimedia purpose,
which could be applied into museum presentations [1,17,23–26]. However, for older adults
and people with disabilities as target groups, there are only two studies [1,23] focusing on
these target audiences.
Therefore, the aim of this review is to examine digital storytelling guidelines and
the latest technology in museums for older adults and mobility-impaired individuals,
framing the research question as follows: “How can a museum develop digital storytelling
presentations with suitable technology to accommodate older adults, aged 60 or more, and
people who have mobility impairments in functions related to the lower body extremities
(mobility), such as wheelchair users and those requiring walking aids”?
Background: Scopes of Older Adults and Mobility-Impaired People in This Review Article
The definition of an older adult differs across countries, as there is no agreement
regarding the chronological age that signifies advanced age. Numerous studies employ
a cut-off age of 50, 60, 65, or even older. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO) [27], older adults in developing countries are typically classified as those aged 60 or
older. However, in Europe it is the case that 65 is more frequently regarded as the dividing
line. Based on this, 60 or older was established as the age criterion for older adults in this
review article.
Regarding disabilities, an additional seven-category scheme comprising cognition,
vision, hearing and speech, body function, arm function, hand function, and mobility
was initially proposed in research based on the principles of universal design [28]. At a
high level of abstraction, three broad categories of impairments are frequently employed
in information and communication technology (ICT): sensory, motor, and cognitive [29].
Neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions of mobility are categorized by
the WHO [27] as follows: (1) functions associated with the lower extremities (mobility)
and (2) functions associated with the upper extremities (motor). This review focuses
on the criteria “lower extremities (mobility)”, meaning those individuals with mobility
impairments who require walking aids or utilize wheelchairs.
When it comes to elderly museum visitors, on the other hand, physical abilities and
health conditions vary considerably. Some may rely on mobility aids, such as wheelchairs
or walkers, while others may have minor mobility issues necessitating only occasional
sitting. The limitations of people with mobility impairments, such as wheelchair users and
those who rely on walking aids, are associated with the physical capabilities of older adults
in this study. As a result, this review article concentrates on those in need of walking aids
and those requiring wheelchairs on account of their mobility limitations. To guarantee that
every visitor can fully utilize museum exhibits and facilities, it is vital to recognize these
various restrictions.
By delineating these categories, a more precise evaluation of the ways in which varying
degrees of mobility impairment impact the ability of individuals to visit and interact with
museums can be achieved. This entails an evaluation of various elements, including
the physical arrangement and design of the exhibit, as well as the presence of accessible

features, such as ramps, benches, and elevators to enhance the accessibility and enjoyment
of museums for these individuals.
2. Materials and Methods
The present study employs the PRISMA [30] flow diagram and theory-based re-
view [31]. The methodology comprises three fundamental components, as depicted in

2.2. Conducting Searches in Diverse Databases
This review article used Scopus, ScienceDirect (as a primary database), and Google
Scholar (as a secondary database). To acquire historical data for comparative analysis, the
search terms “museum presentation”, “digital storytelling”, “older adults”, and “disabled
people” were employed between 2000 and 2023. In an effort to locate information regarding
missing data and case studies from primary databases, researchers utilized Google Scholar
as a gray area (not indexed in main databases but potentially relevant to the research
topic) to conduct an investigation. Next, researchers searched Google Scholar for the top
100 articles through a review of titles and abstracts, from which 50 studies were selected.
2.3. Importing Data into Bibliographic Applications
In EndNote 20, the search results from all three databases were imported. This was
achieved by selecting “Import into duplicate library” from the menu to eliminate duplicated
articles. No duplicated papers were found, leaving 132 articles in total.
2.4. Articles Considered Relevant or Irrelevant
This phase involved three primary stages: a review of all 132 titles and abstracts,
followed by the elimination of 20 titles. Subsequently, 112 pertinent articles underwent a
thorough examination, resulting in the elimination of 6 titles. Ultimately, 106 articles were
selected for inclusion.
3. Results
By employing a theory-based review approach [31], this review examined the signifi-
cance of particular theories in three areas covering inclusive design for museum presenta-
tions, technology in digital storytelling for museum presentations, and digital storytelling
for museum presentation guidelines. This category of review article contributes to the
advancement of the literature by synthesizing and empirically applying a particular under-
lying theory [31].
Next, content analysis was employed to examine all 106 studies. This process entailed
thematic coding, wherein the meaning of the entire sentence or paragraph was categorized
as opposed to the individual texts themselves. The outcomes of the reliability assessment
were reevaluated and categorized by a team of three researchers who deliberated on the
ultimate coding. Briefly, the following three themes exist:
•
Theme 1: Inclusive design for museum presentations (presented in Section 3.1)
•
Theme 2: Trends of technology in digital storytelling for museum presentations (pre-
sented in Section 3.2)
•
Theme 3: Digital storytelling for museum presentation guidelines (presented in
Section 3.3)
3.1. Theme 1: Inclusive Design for Museum Presentations
The needs of museum visitors are diverse, encompassing both obstacles and incen-
tives that motivate their participation in exhibitions. Therefore, to develop effective de-
sign and marketing strategies, designers must understand and strive to eliminate these
obstacles [1,14,24]. In an effort to expand and enhance the potential clientele for museum
presentations, this research employs inclusive design theory to identify the needs of visitors
in digital storytelling presentations in museums, focusing on two specific groups.
Older adults: The majority of the tourism sector, including museums, tends to overlook
older adults, treating them similarly to other visitors [6,7,10]. Despite the global aging
trend, with improved health, increased wealth, and longer life expectancy, this age cohort
is considered a significant consumer demographic [6]. Moreover, older adults in this group
have ample funds and time to invest in facilities and services that can assist them, such as
wheelchair ramps or medical services [32].
People with mobility disabilities: Globally, the number of individuals with disabilities
is expanding rapidly. WHO [27] reports indicate that 15% of the global population, or more

Heritage 2024, 7
1897
than one billion individuals, are presently affected by at least one type of disability. This
quantity is increasing rapidly due to the aging population. The United Nations adopted the
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, guaranteeing comprehensive
integration for this demographic. This requires increasing their engagement levels in the
public domain, and accessible tourism, including inclusive museums, is on the rise. A
growing number of hotels, restaurants, museums, and attractions are announcing their
accessibility to individuals with disabilities [33,34].
According to Ozturk et al. [12], individuals with physical disabilities tend to revisit
locations that accommodate their accessibility needs, potentially generating greater rev-
enue for the tourism sector through market liberalization. This notion aligns with Shaw-
Lawrence’s assertion that “countries seeking to increase their incoming travel markets must
possess the requisite infrastructure and knowledge to cater to the unique requirements of
tourists with disabilities” [8] (p. 8).
Moreover, several studies propose various applications of inclusive design adopted
in museums:
•
Accessibility for all museum visitors: Inclusive design principles ensure that museums
are universally accessible, regardless of ability or disability [35–37].
•
Enhanced learning experiences: Inclusive design enhances the educational impact
of museums by catering to a wide range of learning styles and sensory preferences,
thereby providing improved learning experiences [24,38].
•
Cultural inclusivity: Inclusive design assists museums in representing and valuing
the diverse cultures and backgrounds of their visitors [24,35,39].
•
Social equity and justice: Inclusive museums advocate for social equity by ensuring
equal access to cultural and educational resources for all visitors, including individuals
with disabilities [40,41].
•
Community engagement and collaboration: Inclusive design often requires partner-
ships with diverse communities, fostering enhanced community connections and
active participation [42–44].
•
Enhanced public image and increasing attendance: Museums adopting inclusive
design appeal to a broader demographic, thereby improving public perception and
attracting a greater number of visitors [45,46].
•
Sustainability: The implementation of inclusive design principles ensures the contin-
ued relevance and accessibility of museums for future generations, contributing to
their sustainability [44,47,48].
3.2. Theme 2: Trends of Technology in Digital Storytelling for Museum Presentations from 2010
to Now
3.2.1. User Experience (UX)
UX plays a crucial role in the design, evaluation, and development of various applica-
tions and technological devices today [49–52]. UX could be applied with digital storytelling
on advanced interaction technology (e.g., AR, VR, immersive, muiltimedia interfaces,
wearable technologies) [53,54]. For instance, the “CHESS” project, Acropolis Museum’s
application that could customize museum information in order to generate individualized
narratives, begins with a comprehensive examination of the user’s profile, demographics,
interests, cognitive or conceptual change, value perception, and inspiration, presenting
suitable information and interfaces matched to the user’s interests and profiles.
User experience (UX) encompasses a wide array of ever-changing concepts, such
as aesthetic, hedonic, emotional, and experiential variables. Furthermore, the analysis
is excessively flexible, encompassing everything from a solitary facet of an end-user’s
engagement with a standalone application to the entirety of multiple end-users’ interactions
with the organization and its integration of services originating from various disciplines [53].
Conducting prior research on museum visitors, including their origins, technological and
cultural literacy, age group, and preference for guided or unguided tours, is critical for

Heritage 2024, 7
1898
developing content and experiences that effectively cater to the needs of a diverse museum
audience [50].
Applying for older adults and mobility-impaired people requires taking note of how
several studies [50,55–57] suggest that UX in museums encompasses all user actions and
reactions before, during, and after visiting the museums, as follows:
•
Before visiting: presenting accessibility information, wheelchair accessibility, re-
strooms, and facilities on the museum’s website.
•
During visiting: presenting information about navigation, rest areas, and multi-sensory
exhibitions, as well as providing easy-to-understand materials, large print brochures,
and audio guides.
•
After visiting: offering feedback channels through online surveys and reviews to
enhance the user experience in the future.
3.2.2. Customization Information
In the past, interactive museum narratives aimed to present content on a device as a
single piece for all users. Currently, cultural heritage museums prioritize personalization,
allowing users to provide feedback, rate, or respond to inquiries about their interests.
This enables tailored information presentation to match individual preferences, ensuring a
seamless museum visit [51].
For instance, the “CHESS” project focuses on two key aspects to enhance museum
visits. It emphasizes customization of visitors’ information and provides users with an
exploratory and awe-inspiring experience. Similarly, “Show Taiwan”, a multimedia-
integrated location-based guide application comparable to museum tours, encourages
user-generated content, fostering idea exchange among educators and learners. A study
suggests that this method significantly increases users’ interest in cultural narratives [58].
The “STEDR“ project, providing users with the capability to customize their profile and
location via augmented reality, caters to diverse user interests, recognizing the importance
of convenience in accessing, searching, filtering, and customizing information. Social media
sharing is crucial, allowing users to share their experiences or information online, moving
away from a one-size-fits-all content approach [49].
Applying for older adults and mobility-impaired people occurs in the context of
disabled individuals, where museums like the Victoria and Albert Museum in London
and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston have developed programs to accommodate and
focus on visitors with disabilities, offering specialized programming for those with mobility
impairments, blindness, deafness, or learning disabilities [59].
The personalized accessibility map is an assisted wayfinding information approach
suggested by Karimi et al. [60] for three groups: those with limited mobility, those with
visual impairment, and those with hearing impairment. This map provides individual-
ized details regarding wheelchair parking, the number of stair steps, slopes, grab bars,
wheelchair lifts, low counters, and restrooms.
Yildiz [61] notes that the accessibility menu on the website of the Ludwig Museum in
Budapest, Hungary, which debuted in 2005, provides details regarding exhibition accessibil-
ity as well as information concerning the museum’s accommodations for individuals with
disabilities and physical limitations. Additionally, the museum as a whole and nearly all of
its exhibits accommodate senior citizens and wheelchair users. The building’s entrance is
designed to be universally accessible, and the information desk’s color scheme enhances
its visibility. In addition to providing sufficient space for sitting and resting, the lobby
also features locker boxes. Vertical connections, including stairs, elevators, and ramps, are
well-maintained and easily accessible. Accessible restrooms are situated on each floor of
the structure.
The Mumok, which commenced operations in Vienna, Austria, in 2001, maintains
an accessible website that details facilities, elevators, entrances, and exhibitions, as well
as information on physical abilities and ages. A schematic accessibility map that is both
straightforward and simple to use facilitates navigation within the building [61,62].

Heritage 2024, 7
1899
The DOX Centre for Contemporary Art in Prague, Czech Republic, offers specialized
information on its website, such as details about the ramps in the museum that can accom-
modate all attendees and be utilized as exhibition spaces. The entrance (a sliding automatic
door) is inclusive and accessible. The varying heights of the information desk appeal to
a variety of users, and wide elevators feature seating for individuals with limited mobil-
ity. The size of the exhibition units is specifically designed to accommodate wheelchair
users [61,63].
3.2.3. Mobile Device Technologies
Advancements in sensor technology of mobile devices have significantly influenced
museum applications. Sensors can now capture information like compass readings, device
motion, and GPS location, thus enhancing UX [64]. Projects like “CHESS”, “STEDR”,
“Show Taiwan”, and “The Westwood Experience” use mobile device sensor technology for
user identification and map displays.
The evolution of technology has introduced 4D visualization as an alternative to
3D, incorporating a temporal element into visualization. This is exemplified by “The
Westwood Experience”, which uses mixed reality (MR) to connect the past and present. The
narrative, introduced by the mayor of Westwood during a 1949 community tour, showcases
inaccessible heritage sites through a temporal lens [52].
Advanced mobile devices can integrate real-time location data with traditional media,
facilitated by augmented reality (AR). AR projects narratives onto physical locations via a
mobile device’s display and camera. MR effects, combining video, audio, and images in
authentic settings, virtually convey narratives of fictional or historical worlds, connecting
applications to the real world [52]. “Show Taiwan” enhances the location-based guide
process by integrating multimedia elements activated by users’ motion in their physical
surroundings. “The Westwood Experience”, “CHESS”, and “STEDR” implement MR and
AR to construct sequential narratives in physical location-based environments [49,51].
Applying for older adults and mobility-impaired people in the museum context
involves several institutions, including The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in
Sarasota, Florida, The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and The Melbourne
Museum in Australia, that have specialized programming for individuals with disabilities.
For instance, orientation materials for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
and their family members, including guided checklists, sensory maps, and social narratives,
are provided through mobile phone applications [65].
Furthermore, according to Kruczek et al. [33], the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated
the potential of mobile phone technologies to enhance the accessibility of tourist desti-
nations, particularly museums, for individuals with sensory impairments. Technology
has been used in various ways to enhance accessibility, including the provision of online
communication tools, smartphones equipped with audio guides, and the capability to
directly translate text into sign language [66,67].
Ribeiro et al. [68] also suggest that currently a wide range of mobile applications exist,
providing information assistance to users with mobility impairments or facilitating the
collaborative development of accessibility maps to supplement conventional maps with
pertinent accessibility data [69,70]. Typically, these applications furnish data related to
locations that offer accessible amenities as well as those that do not.
In the context of museums, mobile applications have been created to assist visitors
with various disabilities, including mobility impairments, by providing features such
as audio descriptions, GPS navigation, large text options, and voice commands [68,71].
Ribeiro et al. [68] also suggest that AXSMap implements the storage and dissemination of
data related to wheelchair-accessible amenities in public locations. AXSMap populates its
database with information from the Google Places database and encompasses numerous
global locations, although its primary emphasis is on North America.
According to Ribeiro et al. [68], mobile application technologies designed to assist
seniors and people with disabilities should incorporate accessibility features. These fea-

Heritage 2024, 7
1900
tures can include automatic reading capabilities, the ability to adjust font size and image
dimensions, customized color schemes, and an accessibility map. Furthermore, Roussou
and Katifori [57] argue that these two groups require location awareness via the Global
Positioning System (GPS). To facilitate visitors’ movements and guide them to intended
areas, museum staff or their family must also be aware of their location in the physical
space. Therefore, navigation aids and subsystems for location and orientation detection
are necessary.
3.2.4. Concise Content
In the past, digital storytelling could be defined as anything beyond a simple image
accompanied by narrative voices, texts, or audio with sounds [72]. However, advancements
in technology, particularly those found on mobile devices, have evolved at a faster rate
than content or narratives [49]. This is evident in the complex and sophisticated methods of
blending audio, text, video, and interactivity. Consequently, certain projects emphasize only
the most recent technologies. Furthermore, interactive technologies can be prohibitively
expensive and it may be better to prioritize the development of high-quality narratives and
content that are adaptable across multiple technological platforms. Therefore, to establish
guidelines for producing high-quality content and narratives, it is critical to prioritize user
requirements and the content creation process [49].
Numerous studies have also recommended that, rather than emphasizing complex
and high-tech methods (such as puzzle hunts, events, or games), narratives at museums
should be kept extremely simple. A straightforward, simple, and uncomplicated narrative
structure is sufficient for users [49,51,52].
Applying for older adults and mobility-impaired people in the case of digital sto-
rytelling in museums, Fletcher et al. [65] point out that for disabled people and seniors,
sometimes simple technology and information is suitable for them. For example, a sensory
map serves as an informational layout of the museum’s gallery spaces that assists visitors
in acclimating by emphasizing the presence of other visitors, noise, and light. A social
narrative comprises optimistic first-person statements that an individual with ASD would
either read aloud or to themselves as a means of anticipating subsequent events [73].
Kasemsarn and Nickpour [14] posit that digital storytelling, content, and information
for the elderly and individuals with mobility impairments should be succinct, straight-
forward, unadorned, and devoid of hyperbole. Moreover, technological enhancements
should be kept to a minimum and serve to accentuate the story’s central concept. Due
to its condensed nature, digital storytelling motivates the narrator to omit superfluous
information and prioritize a straightforward narrative that conveys a clear message.
3.2.5. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
The prevalence of VR and AR technologies in museums has increased, providing
accessible immersive experiences for individuals with mobility limitations or those who
are unable to visit the museum in person. Certain museums have initiated the provision
of VR tours, enabling individuals with mobility limitations or older adults to experience
exhibits from the convenience of their residences or a designated seating area within the
museum. VR is suitable for all generations because of its user-friendly nature and ability to
transport individuals to remote historical or modern locations [1,33,74].
Furthermore, there is a noticeable increase in the enthusiasm and drive of older
individuals to acquire knowledge and engage with ICT products [75]. In recent times,
this has prompted scholars to direct their attention toward mobile applications and the
implementation of AR, in addition to seniors and ICTs [75]. Certain research endeavors have
been dedicated to exploring novel approaches that can assist and enhance the self-esteem
of elderly individuals who lack familiarity with digital technologies. The ultimate goal is
to improve their social inclusion, independence, and the accessibility and affordability of
relevant technologies.

Heritage 2024, 7
1901
Moreover, with respect to AR, it refers to multimedia content—such as animation,
video, websites, or 3D—that combines computer-generated images with video footage
captured at an actual location using a video camera. AR is considered a fusion of the
physical and digital realms [76]. According to Guimares et al. [77], a digital storytelling
approach may be applied to AR in a number of categories: (1) natural heritage, (2) historical
and archaeological sites, and (3) garden maintenance.
Applying for older adults and mobility-impaired people, the guideline for virtual
reality (VR) in museums proposed by Vishwanath [78] is implemented at the Design
Museum Helsinki in Finland and addresses the accessibility, inclusivity, and engagement
of a diverse array of age groups, with a particular focus on senior citizens.
This VR experience comprises two scenes. The first involves a five-second looping
video tutorial. In it, users select their preferred language and generation group (Silent
Generation, Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennial, and Gen Z). Users then proceed to the main
scene, which consists of the following: (1) listening to autobiographical stories (approxi-
mately 25–40 s) about a contributed artifact, (2) engaging in virtual artifact immersion as
the virtual environment undergoes a substantial enlargement (approximately 100 times the
size of the artifact) to evoke the sensation of being “immersed” within it, and (3) collecting
artifacts by amassing personal collections of virtual artifacts.
Nishchyk et al. [79] note that the design and development of augmented reality (AR)
for the elderly has been the subject of few studies. Liang [80], for instance, presents design
principles for AR with an emphasis on elderly users. The principles are, in general, as
follows: (1) “hidden reality design principle”—elements generated by a virtual computer
should not obscure practical real-world information; (2) “modality focus augmentation
principle”—depending on the context, computer-generated elements ought to be pre-
sented in various modalities; (3) “instantaneous augmentation design principle”—in the
event of a delay in the generation of virtual content, the user should be notified of the
delay; (4) “layer-focus augmentation design principle”—according to the user’s require-
ments, when more than one piece of virtual content is presented, it should be grouped;
and (5) “accurate augmentation principle”—the augmentation should be pertinent and
consistent with the actual content, taking into account the expectations of the users.
3.2.6. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Museums have begun implementing the use of AI and robotic guides to provide
individualized tours tailored to the needs of seniors and people with disabilities. In
the context of AI, particularly eXplainable AI (XAI), the integration of XAI and HCI
facilitates the development of more engaging interfaces that dynamically adjust to the
specific needs and preferences of the target audience. Adapting to the visitor’s pace and
interests, it can respond to inquiries in multiple languages [81]. Additionally, it employs
personalized mechanisms determined by the visitor’s curiosity, learning progress, and
automatic curriculum learning [82].
Dal Falco and Stavros [83] highlight the potential of contemporary technologies to be
implemented in museums. For instance, certain rudimentary natural language conversation
models can respond to inquiries from online visitors. The responses are selected from a
predetermined set of potential answers. Prior studies and implementations have also been
fruitful for works of a similar nature that integrate interactive storytelling and basic natural
language conversation techniques [84].
When applying for older adults and mobility-impaired people, however, studies
have identified only a handful of instances in which AI was implemented in museums to
promote accessibility and inclusivity. The ArtiMuse project, for instance, seeks to transmit
to future generations the uncommon manual expertise and knowledge associated with
traditional craftsmanship, specifically the wheel-throwing pottery technique [85]. It was
developed to enable both the modeling and recognition of expert technical gestures, i.e., to
determine whether website visitors accurately imitate the gestures described on the page.

Heritage 2024, 7
1902
Scholarly investigations propose the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), a
collection of machine learning methodologies that generate justifications or explanations
to elucidate or simplify the operation of a system. By implementing this in the context
of museums, XAI aims to increase the transparency of cutting-edge models and support
AI-based outcomes via a logical explanation, i.e., one that is intended for non-technical
users. Its primary functions for the elderly and those with limited mobility, both on site and
online, are as follows: (1) generate models that are easier to comprehend while maintaining
a high level of performance, and (2) empower these populations to recognize, rely on, and
oversee the emergence of artificially intelligent partners [86,87].
3.2.7. Internet of Things (IoT) for Enhanced Accessibility
Intelligent museum environments have been developed using IoT technology. In
order to enhance accessibility and direct visitors with mobility issues along less congested
pathways, sensors and connected devices have the capability to modify lighting conditions
and sound levels, deliver personalized information, and aid in navigation [88,89].
Aman et al. [90] provide an additional illustration of an IoT-based museum tour guide
system that is cognizant of its location. This system can identify the user’s gaze on specific
images and, using this information to trigger communication with a central processing
unit, display explanatory content on interactive displays mounted on the museum walls.
When applying for older adults and mobility-impaired people, each individual mu-
seum visitor possesses a unique set of interests. Typical exhibits include a guiding system,
a traditional multilingual tour guide, specialized sections for explanations by experts,
computers, and handheld devices [90]. In the context of portable devices serving as guiding
systems, certain museums offer audio devices that can be used to access exhibit explana-
tions via a designated code number. For example, Kuusik et al. [91] put forth the “Smart
Museum” system, which enables visitors to customize their visit and obtain information re-
garding the museum’s exhibits by using RFID-localized PDAs [88,89,92]. Almeida et al. [93]
discuss the potential application of ICTs that facilitate the Internet of Things (IoT) in the
surveillance of elderly behaviors to support the provision of corrective interventions. Such
projects employ a variety of technologies to monitor the behavior of the elderly, including
AR, vision systems, wearable devices, and portable interactive devices, in addition to
wireless sensor networks.
As noted by Chianese and Piccialli [94], the IoT implemented in museums can be di-
vided into three categories: (1) the sensing layer, responsible for acquiring and transferring
data, as well as facilitating collaboration among nodes in local and short-range networks;
(2) the network layer, the purpose of which is to transfer data across various networks
and applications; and (3) the application layer, where IoT applications and middleware
functionalities are implemented. These enable seniors and individuals with disabilities
to interact with environments and other objects and to receive relevant information via
multimedia facilities.
3.2.8. Social Robots in Museums
According to several studies, robot guides typically serve primary purposes. Initially,
museum guests would be identified and greeted via body or facial detection. For instance,
the robot would recognize a visitor if they maintained eye contact for a minimum of
five seconds and would use motion sensors to identify adjacent visitors before extending
an invitation for interaction. The second function was to engage in conversation with
the visitor and demonstrate the exhibits through natural and human-like body language,
including questioning and providing verbal descriptions, adjusting posture, gesturing,
pointing, and adjusting facial expressions. In conclusion, the robotic systems concluded the
exchange by extending farewells or wishing the visitors a pleasant sojourn [95–97].
Applying for older adults and mobility-impaired people, this sees how the develop-
ment of social robots for public spaces, such as museums, to assist the elderly or those with
limited mobility, is becoming widespread [96]. The classification of robots as social robots

Heritage 2024, 7
1903
is based on their ability to interact with and assist humans. This makes them well-suited
for museum environments, as they can greet, educate, or guide visitors. For example,
visitors to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History were assisted by a
comparable robot named Minerva [98]. Throughout its two-week field trial, the robot
engaged in interactions with over 50,000 visitors. This facially articulated robot can convey
emotions through variations in facial expressions and vocal intonation. When queried,
36.9% of 63 individuals believed Minerva to possess human-like intelligence [96].
All eight factors in Theme 2 are summarized and presented in Table 2 below.

3.3. Theme 3: Digital Storytelling for Museum Presentation Guidelines
Visitors to museums lack the incentive to engage with the narrative presented in the
exhibitions [14,99]. These issues present a favorable chance to enhance storytelling to boost
visitors’ motivation. To achieve this objective, this study proposes digital storytelling, a
technique commonly used in designing digital systems to present various types of stories,
narratives, films, and novels [17,18,26,100,101]. In this paper, digital storytelling is defined
as a medium that uses personal digital technology to integrate multiple forms of media
into a cohesive narrative [18].
When using digital storytelling, a range of strategies, including plots, characters,
conflict, humor, and competition, is employed to endorse and market products or ser-
vices without resorting to aggressive advertising techniques [17,102,103]. Furthermore,
numerous cultural and heritage sites across the globe have been extensively digitized
as virtual museums or applications featuring digital storytelling. This has the effect of
bringing challenging narratives or topics to life and establishing a stronger connection with
viewers [101,104,105].
However, as mentioned in the introduction, there is currently a limited specific guide-
line for the creation of digital storytelling that caters to seniors and mobility-impaired
people in the field of museum presentations, who are not the primary target audience. The
majority of guidelines pertaining to digital storytelling primarily emphasize its application
in educational settings within classrooms and game development.
A number of guidelines have been established by experts on the creation of digital
storytelling presentations. They are grouped into four main purposes: (1) general pur-

Heritage 2024, 7
1905
pose [20–22]; (2) educational purpose [18,106]; (3) interactive multimedia purpose, which
could be applied into museum presentations [14,17,23–26]; and (4) for older adults and
disabled people [14,23]. However, for older adults and people with disabilities as target
groups, there are only two studies focusing on these target audiences.
These guidelines have been meticulously crafted to assist storytellers in the develop-
ment of digital narratives that serve various objectives and incorporate distinct components,
as summarized and presented in Table 3.

3.3.1. Digital Storytelling Guidelines for General Purpose
Regarding Lambert and Hessler’s guideline [20], Lambert was the initial individual
to extend support to Atchley, who in the late 1980s pioneered the integration of digital
media and oral storytelling as a media artist. Lambert, the founder of the Centre for Digital
Storytelling in the United States, organized workshops to assist individuals in using digital
techniques to tell their own stories. Lambert and Hessler [20] developed a set of seven
principles, which are presented in Table 3 and detailed in Table 4. These principles serve as

Heritage 2024, 7
1906
a guide for storytellers as they construct their works. This guideline addresses the practice
of narrating personal stories and non-interactive digital narratives.
Table 4. Digital storytelling for general purposes from three experts [20–22].
Elements
Explanation
Point of view
•
What is the central argument of the narrative and what is the author’s point of view? [20].
•
It is recommended that every narrative be presented in the first person, narrated in one’s
own voice, drawing from personal and emotional experience of the occurrence [21].
•
The narrator is encouraged to imbue the story with significance by demonstrating how the
characters or occurrences in the narrative have affected their own life [22].
Concept
•
A pivotal inquiry that sustains the audience’s interest and is resolved toward the
conclusion of the narrative [20].
•
Disclosing the lesson learned, each narrative must have a concluding point that is
revealed [21].
•
It is anticipated that digital story creators will develop their narrative to a certain extent by
composing and even recording their script prior to commencing any video editing, image
digitization, or sound effect importation [22].
Emotional content
•
Profound and emotionally resonant matters that establish a profound connection between
the audience and the narrative [20].
•
Constructing imaginative tension, effectively using tension and pacing to advance the plot
while maintaining the audience’s interest until the very end [21].
•
Excellent narratives comprise critical components, including conflict, transformation, and
resolution [22].
Showing not telling
•
Demonstrating rather than telling the use of vivid details to convey emotions and
information that are not explicitly articulated within the narrative [21].
Voice
•
A method of personalizing the narrative to aid the audience in comprehending the
setting [20].
Soundtrack
•
Additional sounds or music that support and embellish the narrative [20].
Economy
•
Employing a sensible amount of material to convey the plot without inundating the
audience [20].
•
Condensing the narrative, while maintaining the core of the story, employing minimal
language and visuals to convey your argument [21].
•
This requires meticulous editing and an extremely narrow focus [22].
•
Produce a narrative using minimal technology and resources [22].
Pacing
•
The story’s progression rate, which indicates how slowly or quickly it flows [20].
Developing craftsmanship
•
Excellent craftsmanship combines media elements ingeniously to communicate
substantial meaning [21].
•
Participants in the workshop provide and obtain feedback regarding their narratives and
scripts [22].
In her book Digitales: The Art of Telling Digital Stories (2004), Porter [21] outlines her set
of principles as six components of digital storytelling, as presented in Table 3. She drew
inspiration from Lambert’s original digital storytelling guideline to construct narratives
through the lens of the storyteller’s perspective and personal experience, as opposed to
centering on an external narrative unrelated to the storyteller, as detailed and grouped in
Table 4.
Salpeter [22] proposed six elements for developing digital storytelling projects from
her observations of such projects. Similar to Lambert’s principle, this guideline emphasizes
that tales are based on the personal experience of the narrator, as presented in Table 4.

3.3.2. Digital Storytelling Guidelines for Educational Purposes
Robin’s guideline [106] was published in the book Digital Storytelling: A Powerful
Technology Tool for the Twenty-First Century Classroom. The objective of this guideline was to
assess the quality of student work produced at Houston University [106], as presented in
Table 3 and detailed in Table 5.
Table 5. Digital storytelling for educational purposes from two experts (Robin, 2008; Ohler, 2013).
Elements
Explanation
The purpose
•
Early establishment of a purpose and consistent maintenance of focus are key
qualities [106].
Point of view
•
The point of view is effectively developed and enhances the story’s overall
significance [106].
•
The scope of possible points of view in digital stories is extensive and is limited only
by the perspective that the author wishes to impose [18].
A dramatic question
•
A profound and significant dramatic inquiry is posed and resolved in the narrative’s
framework [106].
•
A storyteller with sufficient dexterity to captivate the audience (either emotionally or
objectively) [18].
Content
•
The content establishes a unique ambiance or tone that corresponds with various
segments of the narrative. The images have the potential to convey metaphors and/or
symbolism [106].
Voice
•
The voice remains audible and clear throughout the entire presentation [106].
•
Tones may alter the genre or tone of a narrative [18].
Pacing
•
The tempo (voice punctuation and rhythm) complements the plot and enables the
audience to “get into” the story [106].
•
The storyteller places the proper amount of emphasis on the narrative (Ohler, 2013).
Soundtrack
•
Music evokes a profound emotional reaction that complements the narrative
effectively. Complementary visuals to the music [106].
•
Use of music in a suitably supportive capacity [18].
Media
•
Images establish a unique ambiance or tone that corresponds with various segments of
the narrative. The images have the potential to convey metaphors and/or
symbolism [106].
•
When determining which visual image to use, consider the amount of time and
technology required [18].
Economy
•
Throughout, the narrative contains precisely the right amount of detail. It appears
neither excessively short nor long [106].
•
Restrict input and story length and enforce economy [18].
Good grammar and language usage
•
The use of proper grammar and usage (appropriate for the selected dialect) enhanced
the text’s clarity, style, and character development [106].
Creativity and originality
•
It is imperative for educators to establish explicit criteria and mandate a specific
proportion of media usage, given that digital tools may inspire students to construct
imaginative narratives but do not ensure novelty [18,106].
According to Ohler [18], his primary emphasis is on the implementation of digital sto-
rytelling within educational settings. Based on his practical involvement in implementing
digital storytelling with both educators and learners, he formulated the eight components
outlined in Table 3. Ohler explains in his book that he adapted Lambert’s guideline for
educational purposes. However, unlike Lambert, Ohler does not emphasize the first-person
point of view. Ohler [18] argues that instructors ought not to limit the manner in which

Heritage 2024, 7
1908
they present to a single pattern. Instead, they should illustrate points of view that are
determined by the students themselves.
3.3.3. Digital Storytelling Guidelines for Interactive Multimedia Purposes
Regarding Paul and Fiebich’s guideline [25], they investigated numerous digital
storytelling initiatives. The research was conducted at The Media Centre and the School of
Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Minnesota. This primary emphasis
was on journalistic storytelling and interactivity. They further characterize it as interactive
multimedia for journalism. Five components for the development of digital narratives are
presented in Table 3 and detailed in Table 6.
Table 6. Digital storytelling for interactive multimedia purposes from five experts [14,17,23–26].

•
Music or sound effects that serve to augment and supplement the narrative [14,24].
•
What is your intended approach to incorporating sound into your work? [17].
•
The narrator employs an assortment of musical compositions to establish distinct
ambiances during the digital narrative while sound effects are omitted. Various
emotions were “reflected and expressed” through music in the narrative [23].

•
Which visual methods do you intend to employ, such as animation, graphics, and
video? [17].
•
The narrator may have employed both explicit and implicit uses of imagery to convey
the story. Some photographs were used throughout, and they all had symbolic or
metaphorical significance [23].
•
Social media storytelling increasingly incorporates visual elements, such as graphics,
videos, music, and new media [23].
•
Immersion level: the extent to which the user is engrossed in the narrative [26].

Background
•
What is the world and the setting of the story? [14,17,24].
•
Does the setting seem realistic or fantastical? [17].
For Schafer’s guideline [26], as her doctoral dissertation, Schafer introduced the “di-
mension star model”, a twelve-point guideline for digital storytelling that she subsequently
published in the textbook Investigations on Digital Storytelling—The Development of a Reference
Model [26]. As shown in Table 3, this guideline focuses primarily on interactive digital
storytelling.
Next, the objective of Hausknecht’s digital storytelling guideline [23] for older adults
is to discover novel methods of communication with this demographic. This research
investigated how seniors incorporated multimedia into their narratives. Additionally, this
guideline emphasizes a technological society replete with multimedia and new media.
This is due to the fact that older adults are increasingly using social media and other
technological platforms to communicate, as presented in Table 3 and detailed in Table 6.
Miller’s guideline [17] provides a comprehensive guide to interactive entertainment.
The guideline and this book exclusively highlight interactive media, including but not
limited to mobile devices, websites, video games, and interactive television. Furthermore,
Miller [17] conducts a comparative analysis of traditional and contemporary (interactive
or online) storytelling tools, providing guidance on how to modify this principle for
application in each medium, as presented in Tables 3 and 6.
In the case of the inclusive digital storytelling guideline [14,24], they found that most
digital storytelling guidelines focus primarily on general media for general audiences
and not museums. Furthermore, most studies focus on the application of cutting-edge
presentation technologies rather than the development of narrative structures. In addition,
the majority of research does not target youth, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.
Consequently, this guideline, applied with inclusive design principles and created by
interviewing target audiences and experts, is designed for different demographics—namely,
young people, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities—and employs strategies to
pique their interest in museum exhibits, as presented in Tables 3 and 6.

Heritage 2024, 7
1910
3.3.4. Digital Storytelling Guidelines for Older Adults and People with Disabilities
Regarding the several guidelines presented, there are only two studies [14,23] focusing
on older adults and people with disabilities as target audiences.
In case of the inclusive digital storytelling guideline [14], the aim is to use inclusive
design principles to understand the barriers faced by these two study groups and to deter-
mine the accommodations they require. Both of these two groups prefer to see the same
characteristics as themselves (e.g., disabled people, seniors) as presenters. Seniors prefer
content about religion, family vacation, and physical health or quality of life, as well as
nostalgia stories about the past. In the case of story structure, they prefer straightforward,
conventional, and conservative aesthetics with direct information, while no gimmicks,
tricks, or hidden plots are necessary. Designers have to present brief segments of infor-
mation. For this group, voice and soundtrack are essential. Lastly, this group prefers all
settings (locations, characters) to be authentic (not cartoon or 3D) and for constructed
historical settings to evoke sentiments of nostalgia. For disabled people, they prefer content
about religion, accessibility, and transportation. In the case of story structure, this group
prefers stable, fundamental, and conservative structures with one point of climax and
dislikes new and rapid structures. Brief information, voice, and soundtrack are essential.
In the case of Hausknecht’s digital storytelling guideline [23] for older adults, this
guideline emphasizes a technological approach with multimedia and new media. This is
due to the fact that older adults are increasingly using social media and other technological
platforms to communicate as follows:
(1) Types of stories: stories encompass both generalizability and specificity, such
as significant individuals (memorial stories), events (adventure stories, accomplishment
stories), locations (recovery stories, love stories), and discoveries (personal journeys).
(2) Imagery process and choice: the narrator may have employed both explicit and implicit
uses of imagery to convey the story. Some photographs were used throughout, and
they all had symbolic or metaphorical significance. (3) Music and sound: the narrator
employed an assortment of musical compositions to establish distinct ambiances during
the digital narrative while sound effects were omitted. Various emotions were “reflected
and expressed” through music in the narrative. (4) Multimedia: social media storytelling
increasingly incorporates visual elements, such as graphics, videos, music, and new media.
4. Conclusions
Digital storytelling guidelines, technologies, and resources that specifically address the
needs of the elderly and individuals with mobility impairments in the context of museum
exhibitions and presentations are scarce. The researchers read each article in its entirety
and, using content analysis, classified the papers into three primary categories: (1) inclusive
design for museum presentation, (2) technology trends in digital storytelling for museum
presentations, and (3) museum presentation guidelines for digital storytelling.
Based on this, the following research question was considered: “How can a museum
develop digital storytelling presentations with suitable technology to accommodate older
adults, aged 60 or more, and people who have mobility impairments in functions related
to the lower body extremities (mobility), such as wheelchair users and those requiring
walking aids?”
First, although museums are beginning to acknowledge the unique requirements of
visitors with mobility impairments and the aging global population, a pervasive oversight
persists. Nevertheless, the positive consequences that museums can anticipate from imple-
menting inclusive design principles are outlined in this article. These include increased
accessibility, enhanced learning experiences, greater cultural inclusivity and social equity,
and more community engagement. By adhering to these practices, museums not only
accommodate the unique requirements of older individuals and those with limited mo-
bility but also make a positive contribution toward the overarching objective of fostering
more inclusive and hospitable environments. For museum designers to comprehend these
heterogeneous groups and implement inclusive design principles, they must be aware of

Heritage 2024, 7
1911
both the barriers that make visiting museums a challenge and the drivers that attract these
individuals to museums. Consequently, barriers could be eradicated, and visitors from
these groups could receive more effective assistance.
Second, this review elucidates notable technological developments that have the
potential to augment the accessibility of museums for elderly patrons and those with limited
mobility. User experience, for instance, requires that designers comprehend and assess user
profiles, demographics, interests, and needs through research and presentations regarding
accessibility before, during, and after the visit. Accordingly, customization information
must be provided that includes only pertinent details regarding accessible facilities (e.g.,
wheelchair parking, accessibility maps, and inclined surfaces). It is essential to utilize
cutting-edge mobile device technologies, including automatic reading, location awareness
via GPS, and accessibility maps. Additionally, individuals with mobility impairments
could be assisted with online museum presentations using VR, and AR could be combined
with multimedia to pique their interest. Online and in-person AI could be implemented
to provide exhibition guidance and explanations, and the IoT, including wearable and
portable interactive devices, has the potential to transform an exhibition into a “smart and
accessible museum” system. This would allow visitors to personalize their experience
while gaining multimedia-based information about the exhibits.
Finally, in the realm of museum presentation guidelines for digital storytelling, pre-
senters who possess similar qualities to those of the visitors are favored. Religious topics,
family vacations, physical health or quality of life, anecdotes from the past, memorial
tales, and sentimentality are preferred by seniors. For individuals with limited mobility,
prioritizing content regarding accessibility is crucial. These groups require information
that is direct, conventional, and concise. A soundtrack and voice must also be provided for
both groups. These individuals value feelings of nostalgia and prefer settings (e.g., loca-
tions and characters) to be genuine rather than cartoonish or two-dimensional. Eventually,
multimedia and social media storytelling for the elderly could include components such as
graphics, videos, music, and new media.
In conclusion, the significance of an inclusive design and digital storytelling approach
to museum presentations and the inclusion of underrepresented target groups is empha-
sized. By taking into consideration the unique requirements, barriers, motivating factors,
supported technologies and presentation guidelines of older individuals and those with
limited mobility, museums have the potential to not only improve the accessibility and
satisfaction of their displays for these demographics but also establish a paradigm for
inclusiveness and active participation in cultural environments that benefits all.
4.1. Practical Implications of This Review Article
This article has undergone a comprehensive review process and has been condensed to
provide insights pertaining to the identified research issue. If researchers, designers, muse-
ums, storytellers, and stakeholders wish to increase diversity, accessibility, and motivation
in museums for these two groups through the use of technology and digital storytelling,
literature reviews and examples in this article could be applied in three ways: (1) In-person
presentations at the museums (e.g., AR, VR, or interactive presentations at the kiosks of
museums); (2) Virtual online presentations (e.g., VR with online museums, GPS navigation,
voice commands, AI with multiple languages); and (3) Short presentations (e.g., advertise-
ments, social media videos, or brief narratives) designed to entice these two target group
visitors to visit.
Moreover, it is our suggestion that museums adopt the following: (1) Establish inclu-
sive design principles as a fundamental component of museum planning and development;
(2) Utilize emerging technologies to generate individualized and accessible experiences
that accommodate the distinct requirements and preferences of every visitor; (3) Formulate
and execute precise and targeted digital storytelling protocols that cater specifically to the
requirements of older adults and individuals with mobility impairments.

4.2. Limitations of This Article
As a result of the scarcity of relevant studies in the primary databases (e.g., Scopus
and ScienceDirect), this review article employs Google Scholar as an intermediary platform
to locate pertinent information and conference and journal case studies. Google Scholar
uses a search engine equipped with “crawler robots” to locate pertinent web pages and has
frequently faced criticism due to its lack of disclosure regarding its search algorithms, its
untraceable approach to sorting search results, and the incorporation of content from non-
scholarly sources into its search results. This implies that outcomes may vary depending
on whether identical and repeated searches are conducted.
