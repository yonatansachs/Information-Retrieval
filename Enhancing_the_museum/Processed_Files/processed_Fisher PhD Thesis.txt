choice
colour
schemes
multi
sensory
ellie

heavy
nice
just
make

like
balance
overwhelming
think
well
maybe
thinking
people
like

quite
possibly
just
universal
issue
yeah
needs
addressing
ashley
fisher
really
always
different
reasons
one
interfered
dyslexia
difficult
able
read
general
little
lights

sort
two
different
conditions
exactly
yeah

probably
lighting
thing
going
long
lasting
impact
migraine
trigger
something
might
necessarily

like
ambient
issue

just
terms
physical
aspect
like
getting
stairs

find
kind
guess
museum
walking
pattern
like

little
bit
stop

harder
deal
impact
feel

wouldn
big
impact
like
five
minutes
stopping
10
strange

something
like
ellie
yeah
think
think
kind
movement
get
used
used
like
constant
movement
can
kind
account
whereas
stop

guess
like
shifting
weight
stuff
without
necessarily
realising

stance
going
disabled
person
every

unequivocal
re
like
definitely
person
disability
re
first
person
given
kind
haven
really
really
thought
find
really

like
official

people
referred
personal
ashley
fisher
really
absolutely
follow
person
wants
identify
absolutely
just
since
writing
disability
yeah
gut
instinct
person
disabilities
participants
writing
one
thesis
advisory
panel
members
said
well
shouldn
really
saying
disabled
person
know
government
stance
re
supposed
officially
just
still
didn
sit
right
glad
can
keep
calling
guys
people
disability
yes
clearly
prefer
yeah
questions
okay
questions
anything
just
want
chat
ellie
specifically
treasurer
house
think
except
suppose

can
go
like
ve
got
much
impression
like
whether
national
trust
re
trying
much
terms
improving
accessibility
439
ashley

can
actually

treasurers
house
specifically
interested
helping

can
whole
lot
physically

lots
lots

exactly
case
study

grade
two
grade

particular
know
wasn
really
able
engage
well
material
great
know
staff
always
want

interact
still
meaningful
experience
coming
ask
questions
get
quite
lot

positive
fact
kind
personal
panel
use
overlay
like
example
certain
museums
heritage
sites
just
big
panels
yeah
obviously
everybody
else
kind
around
re
looking
don
really
want
kind
sticking
overlay
panel
everybody
else
looking
definite
big
advantage
yeah
kind
horrible
situation
kind
like
silver
lining
ashley
fisher
right
said
probably
wouldn
visit
museum
jessica
yeah
think
quite
typical
experience
felt
went
probably
wouldn
able
meaningful
experience
wouldn
probably
wouldn
visit
interested
kind
finding
information
probably
research
kind
maybe
watch
videos
listen
podcasts
something
like
rather
actually
visiting
museum
okay
477
ashley
fisher
museum
remind
museums
visited
jessica
um
kind
similar
gawthorpe
hall
burnely
near
similar
terms
lighting
opposite
house
actually
lifted
lighting
much
restricted
kind
preserved
lived
yeah
basically
similar
kind
kind
visit
ve
done
jessica
previously
burnley
ashley
fisher
think
general
issue
like
manor
homes
heritage
sites
like
yeah
jessica
think
know
re
quite
similar
know
kind
like
castle
howard
another
kind
one
come
mind
re
trying
protect
found
really
much
way
kind
know
adding
know
modern
features
like
lighting
perhaps
panels
know
kind
fly
video
stuff
like
re
really
able
kind
put
much
lack
kind
modern
technology
additions
might
find
museum
example
built
museum
ashley
fisher
stellar
museum
experiences
stand
mind
places
ve
past
jessica
favorite
places
york
minster
undercroft
yes
okay
really
enjoy
even
though
obviously
natural
light
quite
lot
artificial
light
find
work
quite
well
disability
quite
lot
kind
different
interactions
videos
kind
like
build
arch
useless
guess
re
actually
able
kind
engage
see
actual
kind
like
roman
road
walls
stuff
like
like
kind
like
compare
everything
probably
one
favorite
places
go
another
good
place
ve
recently
north
macedonia
places
really
went
holocaust
museum
spectacular
really
really
modern
lot
money
put
know
just
great
array
different
kinds
interactive
panels
video
headphones
kind
know
interact
quite
emotional
kind
went
like
carriages
stuff
like
really
immersive
feel
wasn
wasn
just
kind
standing
around
reading
lot
interaction
something
really
enjoy
things
just
going
around
reading
find
difficult
kind
read
interactive
panels
kind
able
kind
different
way
sure
quite
nice
another
example
srings
mind
liverpool
maritime
museum
slavery
exhibition
exactly
immersive
interactive
weren
just
kind
stood
around
reading
panels
much
engaged
lots
videos
audio
files
stuff
like
478
ashley
fisher
one
things
seeing
sort
common
throughout
lots
different
ways
re
presenting
information
yeah
jessica
exactly
just
one
standardized
way
just
kind
interactive
panels
objects
see
kind
know
immersive
know
find
kind
learn
kind
listening
kind
seeing
kind
like
interacting
stuff
like
rather
just
reading
rather
listen
things
learn
way
rather
just
reading
piece
paper
ashley
fisher
yeah
think
different
expectations
put
paying
versus
non
paying
museums
jessica
oh
interesting
guess
terms
know
funding
side
yeah
re
paying
something
expect
good
almost
yeah
know
re
re
paying
service
well
free
kind
museum
know
expectations
lot
lower
re
paying
service
re
almost
don
mind
much
engaging
experience
sure
re
paying
going
museum
paying
10
pounds
get
realized
unable
engage
anything
haven
know
really
catered
disability
yes
going
like
well
just
pay
10
pounds
kind
come
really
know
meaningful
experience
know
paying
least
able
maybe
audio
guide
use
paying
like
go
somewhere
free
bothered
able
meaningful
experience
kind
leave
short
amount
time
haven
paid
kind
thing
right
ashley
fisher
think
treasures
house
value
money
basically
jessica
um
think
paid
probably
know
know
didn
mean
meaningful
experience
kind
paying
service
might
expect
perhaps
audio
guide
online
resources
can
use
around
museum
able
meaningful
experience
rather
just
kind
reading
interactive
panels
yeah
think
side
things
probably
wouldn
inclined
go
definitely
knew
pay
yeah
knew
meaningful
experience
ashley
fisher
yeah
sure
taken
trip
bad
day
changed
anything
bad
day
like
jessica
mean
bad
day
479
ashley
fisher
um
well
people
like
arthritis
flare
ups
think
dark
day
jessica
yeah
like
dark
day
perhaps
bit
headache
day
example
think
repeat
question
sorry
yes
ashley
fisher
taking
trip
bad
day
changed
anything
jessica
think
probably
think
experience
outcome
still
didn
meaningful
experience
think
nothing
really
affect
think
even
know
bright
summer
day
kind
know
bit
life
think
light
still
enough
yeah
maybe
example
headache
finding
difficult
read
normally
might
inclined
just
bother
reading
anything
yeah
overall
say
whole
doesn
really
make
much
difference
general
didn
really
meaningful
experience
ashley
fisher
general
disappointing
experience
jessica
yes
ashley
fisher
okay
fair
enough
now
probably
invasive
question
consider
disabled
jessica
um
ashley
fisher
right
wrong
way
genuinely
curious
jessica
think
sit
kind
look
say
know
disability
spectrum
know
know
mild
know
lot
people
know
worse
irlen
syndrome
people
worse
dyslexia
feel
like
spectrum
kind
feel
like
don
right
say
disability
definitely
know
example
writing
essays
msterss
know
needed
disability
help
like
needed
often
case
class
disability
kind
compare
peers
class
much
see
disability
yeah
kind
wider
world
mean
job
applications
don
put
disability
didn
feel
like
affect
job
much
feel
like
relevant
job
now
definitely
relevant
like
word
document
like
background
overlay

fair
enough
say
person
disability

person
person

visible
disability
yeah
research
becoming

yeah
never
kind
make
yeah
never
say
disabled
said
just
disability
ashley
fisher
obviously
research
whatsoever
finding
interesting
yeah
jessica
disabled
like
like
overt
term
like
characterizating
play
person
disability

insinuating
lot
layers

showed
different
accidents
people

like
children
things
children

ashley
fisher
think
difference
experience
paying
museums
versus
non
paying
museums
obviously
paying
museum
508
kasi
gonna
ask
one
teagan
think
expect
slightly
pay
amount
pay
scales
wouldn
say
terribly
much
think
partially
re
place
museums
charge
ashley
fisher
yeah
gonna
say
might
cultural
thing
british
people
lot
feelings
paying
museums
can
think
free
museums
ever
went
back
states
includes
tiny
little
county
museum
two
rooms
kasi
charge
singer
museum
think
room
teagan
yeah
ashley
fisher
gone
bad
day
eds
think
changed
things
kasi
sat
lot
frequently
lot
often
probably
wouldn
looked
much
stuff
wasn
chairs
ve
days
ve
gone
museums
just
teagan
mean
tell
tell
tired
end
like
wasn
necessarily
joint
pain
although
joint
pain
starting
uptick
just
daughter
requiring
held
time
think
bottom
tooth
coming
yeah
starting
get
really
really
exhausted
towards
end
just
sat
annora
let
play
blocks
books
also
went
shoe
just
died
moment
kasi
nap
happened
teagan
sense
thought
placed
perfectly
got
getting
tired
just
things
sitting
re
also
kids
differently
although
granted
house
shoe
used
shoe
used
anyone
ashley
fisher
sure
509
kasi
know
less
likely
read
tired
mentally
exhausting
physically
exhausted
fine
ll
just
look
just
cool
thing
look
think
asked
something
read
ashley
fisher
quite
times
especially
victorians
re
asking
going
listening
back
literally
lady
said
ask
questions
kept
saying
approachable
yet
never
approached
kasi
approached
asked
question
teagan
think
kasi
personality
will
literally
start
asking
questions
whoever
standing
just
whoever
literally
right
next
curiosity
strong
enough
actually
go
ask
ask
someone
left
particular
area
ashley
fisher
like
said
correct
wrong
might
adhd
kasi
yeah
yeah
probably
part
ashley
fisher
yeah
probably
just
experience
kids
adhd
ask
question
don
ask
don
answer
within
half
second
don
care
anymore
ashley
fisher
great
transition
probably
invasive
question
entire
process
consider
disabled
want
reiterate
can
tell
don
answering
question
teagan
consider
someone
disability
disabled
mainly
mind
severe
enough
warrant
needing
buy
seats
keys
disabled
toilets
constantly
needing
mobility
aid
constantly
make
significant
changes
work
accommodations
stuff
like
affect
point
say
disability
kasi
agree
just
specifically
wouldn
even
really
say
physically
disabled
mind
mean
mean
get
tired
can
certain
things
long
like
don
need
disabled
toilet
don
need
wheelchair
don
directly
need
things
feel
like
belongs
someone
else
don
know
thing
say
510
actively
impacts
lot
dyslexia
usually
can
get
fine
someone
knowing
like
don
need
special
help
don
really
need
special
accommodations
teagan
definitely
needed
uni
academia
kasi
comes
work
usually
just
boss
understanding
bit
slower
comes
reading
things
will
usually
kind
spelling
errors
bad
teagan
actually
exact
conversation
brennen
long
ago
yeah
suspicion
partially
conditioning
ve
received
stereotype
someone
disability
think
kasi
accept
fact
point
lives
will
disabled
re
older
strong
possibility
will
need
wheelchair
get
around
kind
stuff
kasi
happen
hopefully
significant
amount
time
80s
teagan
able
mother
good
example
now
mother
take
care
body
ballerina
dancer
quite
long
time
polynesian
dancer
always
quite
fit
father
basically
paid
fix
body
many
times
can
think
one
vacation
anything
ever
took
mom
wasn
pain
always
kind
undercurrent
take
kind
painkiller
making
paint
noise
oh
fine
let
carry
just
gonna
sit
bit
guys
come
back
find
don
worry
go
fun
type
stuff
kasi
yeah
mean
think
part
definitely
ve
accepted
probably
best
ever
going
feel
mind
probably
probably
physically
fit
don
think
kind
pains
ever
going
away
don
think
dyslexia
ever
ever
going
go
away
don
think
know
future
definitely
going
regression
makes
sad
wouldn
say
point
unlucky
makes
sense
don
know
also
think
probably
mind
stigmatised
wouldn
call
disabled
severely
mentally
physically
disabled
like
can
get
roller
coasters
can
graduate
college
just
ashley
fisher
think
somehow
linked
independence
kasi
well
think
disabled
people
can
independent
think
someone
wheelchair
depending
severe
independent
partially
mind
much
freedom
like
relying
someone
else
can
walk
upstairs
can
go
kinds
things
need
use
one
511
lift
things
can
walk
stairs
like
someone
can
independent
can
use
lift
thing
can
go
stairs
teagan
yeah
ashley
fisher
interesting
teagan
think
also
fact
kind
hard
judge
everything
becomes
new
normal
soon
get
used
long
enough
someone
may
think
weren
chronic
pain
make
disabled
kasi
chronic
pain
yet
even
like
annora
uptick
amount
pain
chronic
pain
like
scale
one
10
went
one
new
normal
new
constant
wouldn
say
made
disabled
even
though
will
able
say
yes
obvious
uptick
kasi
think
really
interesting
especially
hidden
disabilities
trying
think
like
friend
say
something
like
sort
think
like
whatever
pain
right
now
yeah
re
like
oh
didn
realise
ve
never
pain
complain
gets
point
hard
deal
like
wake
pain
go
sleep
pain
right
good
little
middle
night
pain
sit
pay
night
pain
ashley
fisher
pain
kasi
think
like
taking
said
norm
pain
doesn
make
want
things
doesn
make
able
things
gets
gets
worse
don
know
guess
kind
feeling
can
push
keep
going
like
reading
really
hard
can
push
going
take
longer
gonna
mess
someone
going
get
angry
can
eventually
everyone
can
think
barrier
difference
disability
versus
disabled
ashley
fisher
yeah
teagan
like
sometimes
husband
able
bodied
man
occasionally
pains
legs
refuses
go
doctor
different
issue
doesn
quite
understand
though
want
travelling
kind
stuff
now
sees
like
teagan
may
able
save
money
future
kind
stuff
like
yeah
fine
want
put
something
may
able
future
512
kasi
think
mom
good
example
teagan
mother
good
realistic
expectation
may
end
one
reasons
ve
proactive
terms
physiotherapy
trying
prevent
uptake
annora
way
can
try
manage
kasi
yeah
cuz
like
think
happens
mom
happen
physically
active
kid
college
kind
kicked
mom
kind
just
hit
wall
like
brick
wall
just
pretty
much
dead
stop
fall
teagan
quite
denial
quite
take
kasi
many
