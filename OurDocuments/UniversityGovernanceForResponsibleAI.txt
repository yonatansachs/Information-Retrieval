ABSTRACT
With the democratization of access to artificial intelligence via large language models,
such as ChatGPT, questions about AI ethics in education are at the forefront of educational
policymaking. How do we teach students to engage with AI ethically in coursework, research,
and careers? What uses of AI constitute violations of academic integrity? What norms need to be
established about AI in higher education? This research evaluates official strategy and policy
documents from a wide array of research and liberal arts schools in the U.S. via a combination of
thematic and structured content analysis, to surface policy and ethics concerns and the
institutional structures that shape restrictions, rights, and interventions, following assessment of
interrupter reliability. Results highlight the concerns of universities and emerging approaches to
intervene with respect to the appropriate use of AI in education. Policy recommendations are
made based on the emerging strategies and norms identified via analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed nearly every aspect of
our society, including higher education. The rapid deployment of AI into higher education has
changed the educational experience for students, faculty, and administrators (Chan, 2023). AI
technologies have been applied in various educational settings to increase efficiency in
administrative processes, improve personalized teaching and learning, and support research
activities. Using AI in these different educational settings indicates its ability to potentially
transform education in significant ways. Despite its powerful and profound impact on higher
education, there has been a growing concern in the academia about the use of AI, with the
emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Bing, and Geminia. There are
also questions about AI ethics in education as access to AI via large language models has
increased significantly in the last few years (Sam & Olbrich, 2023). With the increase in access to
AI, universities now have to consider how to teach students to engage with AI ethically in
coursework, research, and careers. The universities also need to decide what uses of AI constitute
violations of academic integrity and what norms need to be established about AI. These questions
sparked debate about the principles and values that should guide the development and use of AI,
which led many higher education institutions to draft AI policy and guidelines for responsible use
of AI. Hence, in this paper, we examined emerging AI policies and guidelines from the U.S.
colleges and universities via a combination of thematic and structured content analysis to identify
policy and ethical concerns, as well as the institutional structures that shape restrictions, rights,
and interventions, following assessment of interrupter reliability.
BACKGROUND
With the increase in access to AI, governments worldwide have been developing national
policies and strategies to offer clearer guidelines on AI usage, aiming to maximize its benefits
while minimizing associated risks. These governments have been trying to address key issues
such as AI discrimination and bias, privacy breaches, human rights violations, and the malicious
use of AI (Greiman, 2021; Hogenhout, 2021; Schiff, 2021). Most national policies on AI
prioritized the discussion of ethics to promote responsible and appropriate management of AI
technologies, focusing on determining what is morally acceptable or unacceptable (Hogenhout,
2021). Many of these national AI policies have referred to Floridi (2021)â€™s framework for the
ethical use of AI, which emphasized five core principles: beneficence, non-maleficence,
autonomy, justice, and explicability. Additionally, Dexe and Franke (2020) reviewed AI strategy
documents from Nordic countries and identified various ethical principles as the implicit
foundation for policy development. Their study also provides insights into the unique approaches
and priorities of Nordic AI policies, which explores their efforts to balance innovation with
ethical considerations in the AI landscape.
Scholars have also started examining the content of AI ethics documents in public,
private, and non-governmental sectors. For instance, Jobin et al. (2019) identified several themes
in a set of 84 documents: transparency, justice, fairness, nonmaleficence, responsibility, and
privacy. Similarly, Schiff et al. (2021) assessed more than 100 documents from public, private,
and non-governmental sectors through the analysis of 25 ethical topics that they developed
through coding. The study highlighted the different ethical considerations that arise in the

development, adoption, and governance of AI technologies across different sectors. In addition,
Floridi and Cowls (2019) argued that the 47 AI ethics principles they reviewed align with
traditional bioethics principles like beneficence, and justice, along with a new principle of
explicability. Overall, previous studies on AI ethics have predominantly focused on assessing the
extent to which a global consensus on AI ethics is emerging.
Recently, AI has also emerged as a transformative force in higher education, prompting
universities around the world to establish policies, ethics frameworks, and guidelines to govern
its development and deployment. In recent years, scholarly discourse has extensively addressed
key issues and trends in the evolving landscape of AI policy and ethics in higher education. To
address the ethical questions posed by AI in higher education, previous studies recommended the
incorporation of AI ethics into curriculum. Borenstein and Howard (2021) emphasized the
growing significance of AI ethics education in response to emerging challenges in AI
technologies. This study highlighted the significance of integrating AI ethics more
comprehensively and systematically into the curriculum and provided a series of suggestions
regarding AI ethics pedagogy. The authors also suggest the need to address ethical concerns such
as bias, privacy, accountability, and transparency in AI systems. Another research conducted by
Chan (2023) introduced an AI Ecological Education Policy Framework for university teaching
and learning. This framework was developed by exploring the perceptions and implications of
text generative AI technologies. By proposing the AI Ecological Education Policy Framework,
this study promotes a detailed comprehension of the implications of AI deployment within
academic environments and ensures that stakeholders in academic settings understand the
implications of integrating AI, enabling them to fulfill their responsibilities and respond
accordingly. Moreover, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization), a respected international organization in education, developed its guidelines and
recommendations grounded in extensive research and global expertise, ensuring relevance and
adaptability across various educational systems and cultural contexts (UNESCO 2021a;
UNESCO, 2021b). These guidelines and recommendations have offered a comprehensive
framework for integrating AI into education, addressing ethical, social, economic, and
technological dimensions crucial for developing effective policies. They have also provided a
structured foundation for addressing specific AI policy and ethics issues in university teaching
and learning.
Other studies related to AI policy and ethics in higher education have discussed the
relationship between academic integrity and AI Large Language Models (LLMSs). Perkins
(2023) discussed the academic integrity considerations of using AI LLMs in formal assessment.
This study explored the potential benefits of AI LLMs in education to support various aspects of
student education, including writing instruction, co-creation with AI, aiding English as a Foreign
Language (EFL) learners, and enhancing Automated Writing Evaluations (AWE). However, the
paper also highlights concerns regarding the ability of AI LLMs to generate original, coherent
text that can evade detection by current technological methods and trained academic staff, which
poses significant academic integrity challenges. This research concluded that whether student use
of AI tools constitutes plagiarism or academic misconduct depends on whether the student
discloses their use and aligns with the academic integrity policies of universities, which must
adapt to accommodate the evolving role of these tools in education. In addition, Kumar et al.
(2023) highlighted the ongoing evolution of LLMs and algorithmic writing, which is expected to
shape the understanding and conceptualization of academic integrity. This study specifically
explored how LLMs like ChatGPT, affects academic integrity. Authors suggests that educators

will need to adapt their approach in this new environment in three stages: awareness, detection
and support, and integration of technologically assisted writing into pedagogy, with
recommendations provided for pedagogy and policy adaptation accordingly.
Furthermore, the use of AI technologies has raised different issues of concern in higher
education (Chan & Tsi, 2023; Chan & Zhou, 2023). The primary concerns revolve around
questions such as how AI might reshape the design of assessment and curriculum, ensuring that
everyone has fair access to these new technologies, redefining the role of teachers, and
addressing the lack of technological support in developing countries (Popenici & Kerr, 2017;
Swiecki et al., 2022; UNESCO, 2021a). With these concerns, AI policies in education are
directed towards addressing several key issues: maintaining the fundamental values of traditional
teaching methods, including teacher-student and student-student relationships (Luan et al., 2020;
UNESCO, 2021b); ensuring inclusivity and equity in the adoption of AI technologies (Tanveer et
al., 2020; UNESCO, 2021a); supporting the professional development of educators to enhance
their skills and adapt their roles (OcaÃ±a-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021).
Despite recognizing numerous concerns within educational environment, policies
regarding AI in education tend to be broad and implicit due to the lack of concrete evidence of
AI technology implementation (UNESCO, 2021a; Schiff, 2022; Chan, 2023). Schiff's (2022)
analysis of 24 AI policy strategies focusing on education's role in global AI policy discussions,
policymakers predominantly perceived education as a means to facilitate workforce development
and train AI specialists. The study highlighted a notable absence of discussions on AI's actual
integration into education policy, emphasizing instead its instrumental role in preparing a
workforce adept in AI. Schiff concluded that if this policy trend continues, policymakers might
overlook the transformative capabilities of AI in education and inadequately allocate resources,
oversight, and attention to address the ethical implications of AI integration in educational
settings. The current literature also lacks adequate attention to AI scholarship and education
governance, and there's limited public understanding of AI policy implications (Feldstein, 2019;
Gellai, 2022). While efforts are needed to develop more comprehensive and targeted policy
frameworks for AI in education, ethics emerges as a crucial starting point for further discourse,
with researchers urged to engage policymakers by focusing on ethical considerations in AI
education (Sam & Olbrich, 2023; Schiff, 2022).
METHODS
To investigate how the U.S. universities are responding to emerging challenges around
AI in higher education, official documentation regarding college and university strategies and
policies were collected from all universities in the 2024 US News ranking of top 100 research
institutions and top 100 universities for undergraduate teaching. Note that 24 universities
appeared on both lists; thus, a total of 176 universities were considered.
After assembling this data set, policies and strategy documents were thematically coded.
This iterative process began with a subset of 10 random policies to surface concepts. Both
investigators worked together to compare and consolidate codes, then cluster them categorically.
When definitions were agreed upon, interrater reliability testing was conducted. This process
took two rounds to reach good or excellent agreement for all codes, after refining the codebook;
the final Krippendorf scores ranged from 0.765 to 1.0. The lowest agreement was present for
sparse codes. Table 1 presents the thematic codes, organized categorically, employed to assess

ethical and policy concerns surfaced in this research. Note that the category of institutions,
including codes differentiating between strategies, norms, and rules, were applied in a structural
sense, drawing on the validated institutional grammar (Crawford & Ostrom, 1995) associated
with the knowledge commons (e.g., Sanfilippo, Frischmann, & Strandburg, 2021) and
institutional analysis and development (e.g., Ostrom, 1990) frameworks.

CONCLUSION
This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the emerging policies and strategies
for governing AI at the U.S. universities. To examine how universities are addressing emerging
challenges related to AI in higher education, we evaluate official university strategy and policy
documents from a wide array of research and liberal arts schools across the U.S. The
combination of thematic and structured content analysis has been conducted to surface policy
and ethics concerns and the institutional structures that shape restrictions, rights, and
interventions, following assessment of interrupter reliability.
This study provides a foundation for understanding the diverse approaches to AI
governance within US higher education. By identifying key similarities and differences between
R1, undergraduate teaching, and universities that are classified as both R1 and undergraduate
teaching institutions, this research offers insights into policy and ethics concerns in the U.S.
universities. The study also contributes to academic literature by offering empirical evidence and
analysis regarding the emerging strategies and enforcement mechanisms for governing AI at the
U.S. universities. In addition, this research aims to inform policymakers, educators, and
stakeholders about effective practices and potential areas for improvement in AI governance
within higher education institutions. Future research should delve deeper into the specific
content of AI policies, examining how these policies are implemented and enforced.
Additionally, exploring the impact of AI policies on students, faculty, and staff would provide
valuable insights into the effectiveness of these frameworks.
