Locating people by capturing multiple optical markers with a mobile device

Indoor localization is still a challenge
today. Conventional methods based on
satellite navigation, like GPS, can only
be used outdoors. On the other hand,
radio signal architectures, like WiFi or
NFC, require high cost infrastructure
to be installed inside the building. In
collaboration with Ixellence GmbH,
the research group for telematics of the
University of Applied Science Wildau
is developing a new inexpensive solu-
tion based on the camera of a mobile
device. This approach only requires
