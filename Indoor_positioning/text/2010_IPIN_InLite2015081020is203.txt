Abstract — A new Indoor Navigation System (InLite) has
been developed by Astrium Satellites GmbH which allows positioning of users inside large multi-level buildings with
an accuracy of two meters without any aiding tools like inertial measurement units or other infrastructure inside
the building. The Architecture is presented, and
measurement results are discussed.

The UR consists of a powerful embedded PC, a ranging
signal receiver, a WLAN data link modem and a
barometer. The ranging signal receiver itself consists of a
RF-Frontend, which includes a 50MHz band pass filter, a
down-conversion stage and an anti-alias low pass filter.
The down-converted baseband will then be sampled by an
analogue/digital converter. The embedded PC collects the
samples via an USB bus. The UR barometer is connected
to the PC and provides height information of the user. The
WLAN data link modem is used to send the XYZ-
coordinates to the MCS.

TC coordinates. The accurate absolute positions of each
TC, related to a WGS84 coordinate system is obtained by
using SAPOS services, otherwise a stand alone solution
can have an uncertainty of about 10 meters. A further task
of the MCS is to provide a communication link with the
UR. As soon as the TC coordinates are calculated, they
are transferred to the UR software. This process starts
automatically, as soon as the UR is connected to the server
(MCS).
The height calculation is enhanced via differential
calculations with respect to the outdoor reference
barometer mounted in one TC #4. The position calculation
in the UR can be started and stopped via remote desktop
connection from the MCS.
Once the UR has calculated the first positioning data,
the data stream will be sent via WLAN to the MCS and
will be visualized in a 3D model of the investigated
building.

rack. The TC power supply is performed by using four
LiPo accumulators with a voltage of 14.8V and 10
Ampere hours (Ah). This leads to availability of the
system of about 8 hours before recharging is necessary.

VII. USER RECEIVER
The InLite test User segment receives the transmitted
signal of all eight transmit stations. The core module is an
embedded PC, connected to an AD Converter. A data link
connection establishes an interface to the Master Control
Station, in order to send the calculated three dimensional
receiver coordinates. The AD Converter sends the data
samples via an USB-Interface to the embedded PC.
The Block diagram of the RF-Frontend is shown in Fig.9.
First we have a band pass filter with 60MHz bandwidth,
to suppress out of band interferers.
After filtering, the signal must be amplified, with a low
noise amplifier. The gain must be in an adequate range, to
avoid an overdriving of the following mixer.
The down converted signal must be band limited, to
avoid aliasing products in the connected AD-Converter.
The low pass filter has also the function of noise power
reduction. The 10MHz reference input must be tied to the
10MHz local oscillator output, to avoid beat frequencies.
Figure 6: View of the InLite transmit station
The output samples (each batch has a size of 16384
samples) of the AD converter arrive via an USB bus in
the embedded PC memory, for estimating the channel
impulse response, and the line of sight delays of each
involved transmitter. Fig. 10 shows the Astrium receiver.
