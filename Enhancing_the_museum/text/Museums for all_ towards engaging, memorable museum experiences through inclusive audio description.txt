“…I hope that audio description can be elevated from its current 
status as a segregated accommodation outside the general public’s 
awareness and launched into the new media – a literary/interpretative 
form with limitless possibilities.” – Georgina Kleege (1956 - )

Abstract 
Museums seek to offer their visitors a rich and rewarding experience that is accessible 
and inclusive. Many museums rely on vision as a means of access to collections. Yet 
having vision does not necessarily mean that visitors are able to engage with exhibits. 
Audio Description (AD) has traditionally been defined as an access tool for people who 
are blind or partially sighted (BPS), which seeks to make visual information accessible 
though spoken language. However, AD could simultaneously provide ‘guided looking’ 
for people with sight. This interdisciplinary thesis sets out the first empirical 
investigation of AD in museums and its potential as inclusive design. Study 1 examines 
current understandings of museum AD, through an international practitioner survey. It 
reveals disagreement regarding whether AD should aspire to be an objective visual-
verbal ‘translation’ or whether it should incorporate interpretative techniques in order to 
provide a rich experience. Study 2 explores the nature of the museum experience by 
analysing autobiographical memories for museum visits, demonstrating the importance 
of thoughts, feelings and personal context in museum memories and demonstrating an 
autobiographical memory coding model. Study 3 investigates the impact of AD on the 
experience, engagement and memorability of sighted participants, with AD resulting in 
richer memories compared to standard audio guides or minimal text interpretation. 
Study 4 compares sound enriched and standard AD on the experience, engagement and 
memorability of blind and sighted people, finding experience benefits for all and 
memorability benefits for BPS people. This research therefore concludes that AD 
should be taken out of its access ‘niche’ and considered as an inclusive interpretation 
tool to enhance engagement and access for all visitors. It argues further that the 
development of inclusive museum AD should be driven by a fuller understanding of the 
nature of the museum experience and its lasting impact.

Introduction to the thesis 
 
The overarching research question of this thesis is as follows: how might AD support 
access to an engaging museum experience for visitors with and without sight? The 
chapters of the thesis present the findings from a series of studies, each of which has its 
own individual research question or questions, and all of which inform on the central 
question specified above. The methodological framework used to approach this question 
is an empirical one, meaning that the findings are based on data that come from direct 
observations and/or measurements of the experiences of research participants.  
The research takes an interdisciplinary approach to the core research question, engaging 
with, and contributing to, three key disciplines: psychology, museum studies and audio-
visual translation (AVT). Within psychology, memory theory and cognition provide a 
crucial theoretical grounding for this work. This research is concerned with people, their 
experiences of objects and artworks and their experiences of museum visits, and the 
lasting impact that these experiences may have. From that perspective, the theories and 
tools in psychology that allow us to measure attitudes and recall are fundamental to the 
thesis. The use of psychological research methods is also what underpins the empirical 
framework. The contribution that the thesis makes to psychology is that it expands our 
understanding of human memory and of the nature of lived experiences with regards to 
culture. In that sense, the contribution is in applying psychological tools and theories to 
questions of real-world cultural experience.  
Within museum studies, and more specifically museum studies practice, the specific 
contribution of the thesis is in using theory and methods from cognitive psychology to 
develop our understanding of the assimilation of inclusive interpretation, and how it 
relates to the visitor experience. Cognitive psychology is concerned with understanding 
and measuring the ways in which people process information, involving perception, 
attention, language, thinking, consciousness and memory. It therefore provides an 
optimal theoretical framework from which to understand audiences and their 
experiences in museums. 
In AVT, this thesis extends the current understanding of AD, as it presents the first 
empirical work on AD in museums. Furthermore, the work broadens the way AD is 
conceptualised. It does this firstly by considering it in the context of inclusive design, 

2 
 
 
and secondly by bringing in insight from other disciplines (museum studies, 
psychology) that relate to the theory and practical measurement of the user experience. 
The individual chapters implement this multidisciplinary approach by reviewing 
literature from across the key disciplines discussed above (and others), according to the 
specific research question. Some historical perspectives are touched upon where 
relevant, but the chapters do not seek to trace the evolution of discourse in these fields, 
rather they aim to bring together multidisciplinary perspectives to build a research 
rationale.  
Whilst the specific methods used vary in the individual chapters, I use a mixed methods 
approach grounded in the empirical tradition, using quantitative and qualitative methods 
with human participants. Mixed methods research collects, analyses and integrates both 
qualitative and quantitative data (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011). The rationale for 
doing so is that it allows researchers to explore diverse perspectives and the design is 
appropriate for answering research questions that neither qualitative or quantitative 
methods could answer alone (Shorten & Smith, 2017).  
The quantitative data broadly consist of information such as rating scales and objective 
measures, but also includes data such as observed frequencies that have originated from 
free text responses from participants (for example, counts of the occurrence of particular 
information given by them). This kind of quantification of free-text uses coding models 
based on existing theoretical understanding developed from previous empirical research. 
What all of these quantitative measures have in common is the possibility for statistical 
inference tests to be applied to the resulting data, and for conclusions to be drawn 
regarding the likelihood of the findings occurring due to chance, or alternatively due to 
differences in the samples of participants, or in the experimental conditions such as 
different types of AD presented. In that sense, the conclusions from the quantitative data 
from a sample can be extrapolated to wider populations. 
The research also uses qualitative research methods. In some instances, thematic 
analysis is used, where it was appropriate to use analysis that was data rather than 
theory driven (Chapter 2). In other instances (Chapters 4 and 5), qualitative analysis 
took the form of analysing themes in free text responses from participants and observed 
frequencies of certain types of information (opinions, reactions).  This analysis was 
driven by theoretical understanding from the research literature. The strength of this 
mixed methods approach lies in the combination of the quantitative and qualitative 

3 
 
 
measures, and what each brings to the other. The quantitative data provide us with a 
level of confidence that the apparent patterns in the data have been subjected to rigorous 
testing, and that wider conclusions can usefully be drawn. However, what brings colour 
and richness to these data is the insight derived from the qualitative data. Both are 
needed in conjunction to give us the best insight into what it means to facilitate a 
museum experience through inclusive AD. 
Returning to the central research question of the thesis: how might AD support access to 
an engaging museum experience for visitors with and without sight? This is addressed 
through the contribution of a series of specific research questions that form the basis of 
the chapters. Within each of the chapters that present a study, the presentation of 
information follows the standard format of an empirical thesis, with an abstract, 
introduction, method, results and discussion. 
Finally, it is important to situate this thesis in terms of its understanding of the 
definition of ‘museum.’ The boundaries of such definitions are recognised to be 
constantly changing, with significant differences around in the world and between 
cultural contexts in terms of the understanding of what a museum is (Brown & 
Mairesse, 2018). In 2017, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) started the 
process of reviewing and revising their definition of the museum, initiating symposia 
that discussed the issue and engaged over five hundred people. This activity led to the 
proposal of a new definition, which sparked international debate and was hotly 
contested. At the time of writing, the vote on the new definition had been postponed, 
and the previous definition temporarily reinstated (ICOM, 2020). Thus, definition is by 
no means a straight forward process. 
Nevertheless, the ICOM review process revealed the social role of museums as a 
paramount concern (Brown & Mairesse, 2018). This thesis is concerned with the 
investigation of inclusive, engaging museum experiences. As such, the research is 
visitor-centric, and seeks to be in line with the increasing focus on social aspects of 
museology. The concept of the museum in this research, therefore, is not restricted to 
any specific type of institution, whether in terms of size, scope, collections, provision or 
any other aspect. Indeed, it could be argued that the research should be applicable to 
broader cultural and knowledge-based institutions such as historic houses, science 
centres and zoos. As such, the concept of ‘museum’ is broadly understood in 
accordance with the ICOM current definition, namely as an institution which ‘acquires, 

4 
 
 
conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of 
humanity and its environment for the purpose of education, study and enjoyment’ 
(ICOM, 2020).  However, it should also be broadened to include institutions that may 
have similar goals and objectives as museums, but which may not fit comfortably into 
all aspects of the above definition. Thus, the potential for AD to support access to 
engaging museum experiences can be considered in the context of any institution that 
deals with the communication of the ‘heritage of humanity’; in short, all institutions that 
seek to engage their visitors and provide a memorable experience through the telling of 
their stories.

Chapter 1: Introduction: a place for audio description 
in an inclusive museum? 
 
Abstract 
This chapter sets out the rationale to address the overarching research question of this 
thesis: how might AD support access to an engaging museum experience for visitors 
with and without sight? In order to do this, it brings together relevant insight from the 
theory and research literatures of psychology, museum studies and AVT. It discusses 
these inter-disciplinary perspectives to examine how access and inclusion can be 
understood in the museum context. If ‘access’ is access to a museum experience, then 
understanding the nature of this experience is crucial. It is also fundamental to explore 
how can engagement be understood in the museum context, and what are the potential 
barriers to engagement may be. The chapter examines the role of museum interpretation 
in responding to the challenges raised by these barriers and introduces the academic 
field and practice of museum AD. The chapter goes on to explore reasons why AD may 
be of benefit to all museum visitors, not exclusively those who are blind or partially 
sighted for whom it was originally intended. It presents relevant theory from 
psychology that addresses cognition in museums: imagery, multisensory processing, 
and memorability, and sets out reasons why these aspects of cognition are of relevance 
to a broader understanding of the visitor experience and to an exploration of AD 
specifically. Finally, the chapter discusses autobiographical memory theory from 
psychology and its relevance to museums. It presents the rationale for using memory 
theory to develop measures addressing the impact of museum experiences facilitated 
through AD. The chapter concludes by presenting the structure of the thesis and the 
specific research questions posed by each of the subsequent chapters.

What is access? 
In the late 18th century, museums for the general population developed as institutions 
where visitors came to look at artworks and objects in a reverential and authoritative 
environment (McClellan, 2008; Prior, 2003).In recent decades, a new understanding has 
developed amongst museum professionals and researchers about the function of 
museums in society, with the museum sector recognising the need to become more 
outward looking and audience focused (Sandell, 2003). Central to this new museology 
is the recognition that museums have the potential, and the ethical imperative, to 
become institutions that engender audience empowerment. At the individual level, this 
empowerment could take the form of increased creativity, enhanced self-esteem, 
confidence (Sandell, 2003) or wellbeing (Chatterjee & Noble, 2013; O’Brien, 2010). At 
the community level, this empowerment could take the form of social regeneration, 
enabling communities to grow in confidence and to take control over their lives and 
their environment (Sandell, 2003). Museums’ social inclusion agendas also seek to 
drive change at the societal level, targeting positive change in areas such as poor health, 
high crime, low educational attainment and unemployment (Sandell, 2003).  
However, what is essential to these ambitious aims for museums in the 21st century is 
access and inclusion. Without access and inclusion, individuals, communities and 
ultimately society will not be able to benefit from the progression that museums seek to 
make towards being audience-centric institutions. It is widely accepted that museums 
have an ethical as well as legal imperative to provide access and enable inclusion. The 
right to access, participate in and enjoy culture is a human right regardless of one’s 
physical, sensory or cognitive ability, as formalised by Article 27 of the Universal 
declaration of Human Rights, 1948, and international legislation (e.g. American with 
Disabilities Act, 1990; UK, Equality Act, 2010). What is less clear is what access means 
in the museum context. To what exactly, must museums provide access, and how 
should they do it? 
The expectation is that museums should be accessible to all visitors; intellectually, 
physically, socially, culturally and economically (Black, 2005). Access has traditionally 
focused on audience segments with sensory impairments, physical access needs such as 
wheelchair use, learning difficulties or conditions such as autism that may require 
careful management of the museum environment. One such access initiative is AD, 
which is provided for the use of BPS people in museums. AD is typically understood as 

7 
 
 
the provision of visual information in verbal language (Fryer, 2016; Synder, 2014), and 
thus framed, can be understood as a kind of physical access resource whereby the 
physicality of collections, i.e. the physical appearance of objects and artworks, is made 
accessible to BPS people. However, museums recognise that access can extend beyond 
the physical aspect, with museum research and practice focusing increasingly on the 
inclusion of diverse groups of visitors and non-visitors who may face various barriers 
(Dodd, Jocelyne & Sandell, 2001; Lang, Reeve, & Woollard, 2006; Leonard, 2010). If 
access means access to or inclusion in a broader experience of museum visiting, then 
what are the implications for an access initiative such as AD? If visitors are to have an 
equitable experience in the museum, then this necessarily requires a deeper 
understanding of what that experience is in order to provide that access. An examination 
of what is known about the museum experience is therefore pertinent to these questions, 
as is an exploration of how fields within cognitive psychology can illuminate both the 
nature of the experience, and approaches to its evaluation. 
The museum experience 
The museum experience, and in particular, sensory engagement with collections, has 
evolved and changed over time. The primacy of vision in relation to the other senses has 
also not been constant. Early collections, such as the wonder cabinets of the renaissance, 
were more about possession than display, and objects were not necessarily laid out for 
careful viewing (Greenblatt, 2018). Many people’s encounters with these collections 
were entirely textual, rather than directly visual, as they relied on reading written reports 
about them, which were circulated as ‘virtual equivalents’ of the objects themselves 
(Greenblatt, 2018, p.29). Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century encounters with 
collections are also thought to have been characterised by sensory engagement beyond 
the visual, with it not being unusual for people to smell, taste and touch objects as well 
as look at them (Classen, 2017; Leahy, 2016; Levent & Pascual-Leone, 2014).  
In the nineteenth century, the numbers of visitors to museums grew, and 
correspondingly so did concerns about damage to the collections (Classen, 2017). 
Touch was increasingly forbidden as part of a drive to subdue the behaviour of the 
‘masses’ in the museum (Classen, 2017). Vision became privileged over the other 
senses, and observation and representation became key ways in which the world and its 
reality were understood and ordered (Macdonald, 1998). The foregrounding of visual 
access meant increasing focus on the display and arrangement of objects, with no 

8 
 
 
attention paid to the needs of individual visitors. Rather, they were treated as a mass, 
and expected to learn through visual access to collections, in a form of museum 
pedagogy which was one-way transmission: visitors would be led through a structured 
visual environment by which they could understand the museum’s authoritative master 
narratives (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000). There was no consideration of individual visitor 
differences in the act of looking. 
In the museology of the twentieth century, the act of looking and its relationship with 
art has been interrogated (Berger, 1972). The notion of looking as a neutral act that is 
the same for all visitors has given way to a constructivist understanding of looking as a 
‘reading’ of collections which is highly contingent on the individual and their context 
(Hooper-Greenhill, 2000). In this sense, the emphasis in museums shifts from objects, 
as inherent holders of meaning, to visitors, as makers of meaning. Furthermore, for 
some museums and collections, the visuality of the object is relatively unimportant, and 
it is the story of how it came to be on display that can impact on the visitor. Greenblatt 
(2018) explains, for example, how the objects of the Jewish museum in Prague are 
unremarkable for their antiquity or their beauty, but their importance lies in their ability 
to provide access to people and memory. In this sense, aesthetic discrimination is not 
the point, and viewing takes second place to stories. 
This recognition and questioning of the primacy of vision has led to a different 
understanding of visitors and their experience in the museum. It is now recognised that 
an authoritative model of museum pedagogy does not allow for individual interpretative 
processes (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000). Furthermore, exhibition design that does not 
specify specific audiences and seek to understand their needs may exclude visitors or 
make people feel inadequate (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000). It is no longer acceptable for 
museums to expect visitors to assimilate narratives purely through visual access 
(Hooper-Greenhill, 2000.) This has led to increasing focus on other forms of sensory 
engagement with many multisensory approaches in modern museums (Classen, 2017; 
Levent & Pascual-Leone, 2014). However, multisensory experiences are still the 
exception rather than the norm, and the majority of museums still rely on vision as the 
primary way for visitors to experience collections (Levent & Pascual-Leone, 2014). 
Although opportunities for multisensory engagement are not mainstream (Levent & 
Pascual-Leone, 2014), museology’s understanding of sensory engagement in the 
museum has evolved, and looks set to continue to do so (Classen, 2017). Modern 

9 
 
 
interest in sensory engagement is also significant in that it foregrounds the visitor, their 
experience and their needs.   
Understanding the broader nature of the museum experience is indeed central to the new 
museology and its focus on visitors, and has therefore been driving empirical research 
in Visitor Studies in recent decades (Chan, 2009; Chiappa, Andreu, & Gallarza, 2014; 
Dierking & Falk, 1992; Packer, 2008; Schorch, 2013; Soren, 2009). Pine & Gilmore’s 
(2011) model of the experience economy provides a useful structure by which leisure 
experiences such as museum visits can be understood. The model sets out 4 realms of 
experience within the experience economy, namely education, entertainment, escapism 
and aesthetics.  Empirical findings have demonstrated the relevance of this model to the 
museum experience, such as Radder & Han’s (2015) study of data from visitors to 
South African heritage museums. This research confirmed the presence of three 
museum experience realms, ‘edutainment’ (education and entertainment combined), 
escapism and aesthetics. These three realms indicate the breadth and variety of the 
museum experience, with visitors coming to stimulate their curiosity, increase their 
knowledge, share social experiences with family and friends and have fun, interact with 
other visitors, have an unusual experience, situate themselves in another time or place, 
get away from sources of stress, and experience a pleasing physical environment 
(Radder & Han, 2015).  
Consistent with this is the recognition in the wider research literature that museums are 
experiential products, in the sense that their raison d’être is to facilitate experience 
(Doering, 1999), and that people therefore visit museums for many reasons.  Whilst 
some visitors may come in search of deep knowledge (Anderson, 2003) or to gain 
cultural capital (Prentice, 2001), many will view their time in museums primarily as a 
leisure activity (Doering, 1999; Foley & McPherson, 2010). Perceived benefits include 
escapism (Slater, 2007), having fun (Roppola, 2012) and achieving a sense of 
‘restoration’ whereby they feel a sense of recovery from the stresses of everyday life 
(Packer, 2008).  
Furthermore, ‘learning’ in museums is understood by researchers to be primarily 
experiential, with ‘learning experiences’ seen as valuable but hard to quantify, not least 
because they encompass the development of thinking skills as well as learning of ‘facts’ 
(Duke, 2010). Although learning in museums can be intentional, where people come in 
search of information, much ‘learning’ may be incidental: learning that just happens, 

10 
 
 
without too much awareness of it taking place (Kelly, 2002). Thus, models that inform 
on ‘learning’ in museums also inform on the nature of the experience. Falk & 
Dierking’s contextual model of learning (Falk & Dierking, 2000) suggests that there are 
three main contexts to a visit that are dynamic and changing over time: the personal, 
sociocultural and physical contexts. The personal context indicates that learning will 
occur according to an individual’s motivations and expectations, as well as their prior 
knowledge and experience (Falk & Dierking, 2000; Falk & Storksdieck, 2005). The 
sociocultural context emphasises the influence of interactions with others, and the 
physical context suggests that learning is a dialogue with the physical environment of 
the museum, with learning being contingent on how the visitor navigates and 
experiences the museum space (Falk & Dierking, 2000). All of these variables form part 
of the overall museum experience, and emphasise the experiential nature of ‘learning’. 
Therefore, ‘learning’ in museums can range from ‘highly complex conceptual 
understanding’ to ‘simple awareness of things’ (Anderson, Storksdieck & Spock, 2007, 
p.198). 
As museums become increasingly audience focused, this provides a corresponding 
opportunity for theory and methods from psychology to explore and understand 
behaviour and cognition in relation to the museum experience. One way in which 
researchers have explored the nature of the museum experience and its lasting impact is 
through examination of museum memories (Anderson, 2003; Anderson & Shimizu, 
2007; Dierking & Falk, 1992; Falk, 2013; Falk & Dierking, 1990, 1997; Medved, 
Cupchik, & Oatley, 2004; Medved & Oatley, 2000). Whilst it is recognised that what 
someone remembers from a museum visit is not exactly the same as what is learnt 
during the visit, the relationship between memory and learning has driven interest in 
examining museum memories, and it has been argued that understanding what someone 
remembers from their visit is critical to understanding the entire museum visitor 
experience (Falk, 2013).  
Museum memory studies have taken a variety of approaches from the disciplines of 
museum studies and cognitive psychology, drawing on both qualitative and quantitative 
methods. Quantitative methods are typically concerned with counting occurrences, 
volumes, or the size of the associations between variables, whereas qualitative research 
seeks to provide rich descriptive accounts of the phenomenon under investigation (Celo, 
Braakmann, & Benetka, 2008).  

11 
 
 
In the museum memory literature, there are a number of studies which have analysed 
the content of museum memories in order to examine which elements of a museum visit 
stay with the visitor over time (Anderson, 2003; Falk & Dierking, 1990, 1997; Medved 
& Oatley, 2000). Whilst the findings of these studies indicate what the long-term impact 
of a visit may be, there are various methodological limitations. Falk & Dierking’s 
(1990) study, for example, presents findings of the content of visitor memories, such as 
social interactions, objects or exhibits viewed, aspects of the physical environment of 
the museums, emotion, and thoughts. However, this small, exploratory study with 12 
museum professional participants, cannot, as recognised by the authors, present any 
generalisable findings, as the low participant numbers and the specificity of the sample 
mean the data cannot be meaningfully extrapolated to any wider population.  
Furthermore, the content elements were also determined by the researchers and directed 
the interviews, rather than allowing for free recall.  
This was also the case in a study looking at the long-term impact of school trips by the 
same authors (Falk & Dierking, 1997), where interviews with pre-determined prompts 
were used to draw out recall of feelings experienced at the time, the physical context of 
the museum and social experiences (Falk & Dierking, 1997).  Anderson’s (2003) study 
also addresses content of memories, with interviews structured around pre-determined 
themes such as events, occurrences and happenings, memory for what was seen in 
displays, memories for details of the physical setting, social interactions, sensory 
experiences and emotions, visitors’ recall of their agendas or socio-cultural identities at 
the time of visiting. Whilst these themes are more comprehensive in terms of 
understanding the breadth and details of the experience, the data were analysed 
qualitatively, thereby limiting a) the conclusions that could be drawn about the relative 
importance or weighting of these themes and b) the generalisability of the findings.  
Research exploring ‘learning’ in a science centre (Medved & Oatley, 2000) considered 
the relationship between memories for information and concepts learnt in the museum 
(semantic memories) and memories for interactions with an exhibit (episodic 
memories). Semantic memory refers to our general knowledge about the world, and 
episodic memories are memories for specific events (Tulving, 1972). Findings showed 
episodic memories of exhibit interactions to be relatively stable, but semantic memories 
for information and concepts to be subject to deterioration over a month in one third of 
the sample, suggesting that the impact of ‘learning’ in visitor was highly variable over 
time (Medved & Oatley, 2000). Whilst this research shows evidence of impact in the 

12 
 
 
form of stable memories of exhibits, it did not consider other aspects of the museum 
experience, such as social interactions or recall of the environment in the form of 
sensory impressions.  
Finally, Anderson & Shimizu, (2007) looked at long-term memories of an exhibition 
centre, and the behavioural and psychological factors that impacted on memory 
vividness, namely affect, agenda fulfilment and rehearsal, finding rehearsal (later 
discussion of the event with others) to be the most important. In this study, participant 
interviews captured a broad spectrum of details recalled about the experience, such as 
sensory information, emotions, events and thoughts. However, this detail was used to 
assign a vividness score in order to assess the richness of the memories, and the specific 
details of the content were then subsequently lost from the analysis.  
Overall, this body of research therefore shows the potential for research methods and 
theory from cognitive psychology to work with insight from museum studies, in order 
to evaluate the nature and impact of the museum experience through analysis of 
memorability. However, there is a need for deeper and more consistent research 
(Eardley, Mineiro, Neves & Ride, 2016) at the intersection between these two 
disciplines, in order to fully exploit the application of memory theory to our 
understanding of the museum experience. Nonetheless, the existing literature opens up 
the question of what the museum experience may be, and how psychological evaluation 
of it can be developed. It also serves to emphasise that if access to a museum means 
inclusion in a cultural experience, with all the diverse aspects of experience that this 
implies, then this raises the question of what true access to the museum experience may 
be; whether it is being able to access information about the physical nature of 
collections (visual information), or whether it should seek to encompass emotional, 
social and cognitive engagement.  On the premise that ‘access’ means access to an 
engaging experience, this chapter will now go to on examine the nature of engagement 
in museums. 
What is engagement in the museum? 
It has been suggested in the museum literature that engagement with art more broadly 
(Edmonds, Muller, & Connell, 2006) and in museums in particular (Taheri, Jafari, & 
O’Gorman, 2014) can be understood in multiple ways and resists straightforward 
definitions. Engagement with the arts has been discussed in the research literature as a 
state whereby visitors are engaged emotionally, cognitively and socially, enabling them 

13 
 
 
to make connections both within themselves and with the world (McCarthy, Ondaatje, 
Zakaras, & Brooks, 2004). The application of understanding from cognition allows for 
ways in which engagement can be characterised and measured.  
Engagement requires a state of focused attention in the visitor (McCarthy et al, 2004; 
Sandell, 2003) and indeed the construct of attention is one aspect of cognitive 
psychology that can be usefully applied to a consideration of the nature of engagement. 
This is as applicable to museums as it is to the arts more widely. Firstly, the key aspects 
of attention are the fact that it can be captured, visitors can decide where to focus their 
attention (which also implies they may need support in knowing how to direct it), and 
that attention capacity is limited. It is crucial for museums to find ways to enable 
visitors to direct their attention in ways that are profitable to them, as otherwise, 
engagement and learning cannot follow (Bitgood, 2013).  Furthermore, focused 
attention is believed to characterise the development of interest (Renninger & Hidi, 
2015). Attention capture is required to trigger situational interest; in other words, when 
people are new to content, and they do not yet have an interest in it, attention must be 
captured in order for interest to develop. Although interest and engagement are distinct 
constructs, interest can lead to meaningful engagement (Renninger & Hidi, 2015). 
Attention and interest will therefore characterise engagement with a museum’s 
collections and with specific exhibits. 
However, engagement could also be considered in a broader sense in the museum 
context, in terms of enjoyment, or emotional involvement in the overall experience of 
visiting the museum. This is where taking a broad understanding of the museum 
experience is essential, as aesthetic, emotional, intellectual, or social stimulation may all 
contribute to a sense of engagement. This stimulation may stem from the exhibits 
themselves, be facilitated by the environment that the museum provides, or may simply 
form part of the experience that the visitor has that day. All of these scenarios can 
contribute to what we can usefully consider engagement. For museums, understanding 
the full spectrum of engagement can help to develop an understanding of how to help 
create rewarding experiences for their visitors. In this thesis, a working definition of 
engagement in the museum is that it can be understood as a cognitive and emotional 
response in the visitor, either in response to specific stimuli within the museum such as 
exhibits, objects or artworks, but also potentially in response to the wider context of the 
visit – in other words, the event of the visit and all of the emotional, cognitive and social 
aspects of which it may consist. However, it may not always be straightforward for 

14 
 
 
visitors to experience engagement within the museum. Multiple barriers can result in 
different levels of engagement amongst different visitors. 
Barriers to engagement 
Various access initiatives have been developed for people with specific sensory 
impairments and physical or learning needs, but it is well recognised that museums are a 
physically demanding environment for all visitors.  Many museums are very large, with 
collections spread over multiple floors, they may be overcrowded, and therefore a 
difficult and tiring environment to navigate. These challenging environments have led 
to a research focus on the manifestation and causes of ‘museum fatigue’ (Bitgood, 
2009; Petrelli, Not, Zancanaro & Finn, 1999). 
Furthermore, museums typically present an array of visual stimuli which may 
overwhelm the visitor (Bitgood, 2013). This has led researchers to advocate reducing 
the number of exhibits that are visible at any one time, to encourage selection, and to 
urge a general ‘controlling of visual access’ in exhibition design (Bitgood, 2013, p.164). 
The overwhelming array of visual stimuli available in the museum tends to lead to what 
can be characterized as browsing behaviour, where people spend only a very short time 
in front of any one exhibit or artwork (Smith & Smith, 2001). Smith & Smith’s (2001) 
research in art museums has shown that, even where people have physically stopped at a 
work of art to look at it, the average time spent looking is only around 17 seconds. This 
suggests that for many visitors, a visit consists of many quick glances at artworks, rather 
than a lengthy contemplation of fewer pieces. The same authors recently repeated their 
study on viewing time, reporting a median view time of 21 seconds (Smith, Smith, & 
Tinio, 2017), again suggesting that visitors appear to ‘consume’ the works on display, 
rather than engaging deeply with them.  Thus, it is possible for an artwork to capture 
attention, and for visitors to briefly focus attention, but for that attention to occur with 
minimal engagement.  
Furthermore, differences between visitors influence how they direct their visual 
attention and therefore potentially the level of access that their vision gives them to 
collections. Eye tracking research, which tracks eye position and eye movement in 
response to a visual stimulus, has demonstrated different viewing patterns for art experts 
compared to novices who know very little about art (Koide, Kubo, Nishida, Shibata, & 
Ikeda, 2015; Vogt & Magnussen, 2007). Whereas the fixations of novices tend to centre 
on salient features, such as human faces, objects, or other recognisable features, visitors 

15 
 
 
with art expertise will spend less time on these features and more time examining 
structural or abstract features (Koide et al., 2015; Vogt & Magnussen, 2007). This 
indicates that there is diversity in how visitors are able to attend within the museum, 
according to their individual educational backgrounds and existing knowledge. This 
also implies diversity, therefore, in how well people will be able to access the museum 
and its collections.  
Although multisensory museum exhibits are increasingly receiving attention in both 
research and professional contexts (Schorch, Walton, Priest, & Paradies, 2015; Levent 
& Pascual-Leone, 2014), the majority of museum interpretation, at least for permanent 
collections, is still typically delivered through written information in the form of gallery 
text or artwork labels (Whitehead, 2011) and accompanies the act of looking at a work 
of art. This reliance on vision is obviously a major barrier for visitors with low or no 
vision, but it may also be limiting for fully sighted people. If it is difficult for some 
visitors to know how or where to direct their visual attention, and how to gainfully 
prolong the time they spend engaging with an object or artwork, then this implies 
potential difficulties for engagement. If visitors are to have the level of cognitive, 
emotional and social engagement that many museums seek (Schorch, 2014), then they 
may require support in accessing this level of engagement, and hence in accessing a rich 
museum experience. 
What is the role of museum interpretation in overcoming these barriers? 
Museum interpretation seeks to communicate what curators consider to be significant 
information about the artwork, the artist, or the cultural context in which it was 
produced (Serota, 1996) and its function is to support engagement with collections by 
helping visitors connect to meanings (Gross & Zimmerman, 2010). Interpretation is 
already inherent in the process of selecting works or objects to be displayed, in how 
they are presented, and often takes the form of text-based resources such as labels or 
guided information. Whereas historically interpretation may primarily have consisted of 
scholarly displays, today, museums recognise that it should aim to invite audience 
participation and arouse curiosity (Gross & Zimmerman, 2010). Ultimately, it should 
link tangible objects (that can be perceived) to intangible meanings, and help people to 
learn new things or to confirm things they already think they know (Bitgood, 2013), as 
well as developing thoughts and ideas (Gross & Zimmerman, 2010). For visitors to 
focus attention, and for their interest to be triggered, museum need to make 

16 
 
 
interpretation available which provides the optimal environment for a state of 
engagement to occur.  
The cognitive effort required to assimilate interpretation can, however, be significant, 
and exacerbated by the physical demands of the environment (Bitgood, 2009). For 
interpretation to facilitate the depth of processing that museums desire, its delivery must 
be carefully designed and managed, so that the effort required to focus attention is 
minimised and the rewards are great. In one study, for example, researchers found that 
dividing an interpretive label of 150 words into three short labels of 50 words each 
resulted in more than doubling the percentage of readers of the information (Bitgood & 
Patterson, 1993). One form of interpretation that does not expect visitors to rely entirely 
on vision is audio interpretation, in the form of audio guides. For visitors without 
specific access needs, audio guides are a potential form of interpretation, and are 
available in nearly all mid-size and large museums, either separately or built into the 
ticket price (Proctor & Tellis, 2003). For visitors who are blind or partially sighted, 
audio in the form of audio descriptive guides or AD delivered in a live tour is a crucial 
form of access.  
Audio in museums: Audio Description 
AD was introduced in the US in the 1980s, starting in theatre, for the purpose of 
translating visual elements into a verbal narrative for the benefit of BPS people. It has 
been in use in the UK since the late 1980s.The 1995 Disability Discrimination Act, 
since superseded by the Equality Act of 2010, has further formalised the growing 
industry of AD. The Equality Act of 2010 served to bring together a series of acts and 
regulations regarding anti-discrimination law and it now ensures that service providers, 
including museums, galleries and heritage sites, have a legal obligation to make 
‘reasonable adjustments’ for people with disabilities. The notion that access is a right, 
rather than a privilege, has led to growth in the applications of AD and its use is now 
established in TV, cinema, theatre, museums, galleries, architectural and heritage sites 
as well as in live events such as the inauguration of President Obama and the Olympic 
Games. Delivery of AD depends on the situation. It may be delivered live by an audio 
describer sitting in a theatre booth, or through a live tour in a museum. Recorded AD 
can be inserted into gaps in a film’s dialogue, or delivered in museums and galleries 
through headsets, in the same way as a traditional audio guide. In the UK, AD currently 
addresses the needs of a population of 360,000 people registered blind or partially 

17 
 
 
sighted (RNIB, 2017). Given the needs of an aging population, the applications and 
demand for AD seem set to increase. 
In academic research, AD is a multidisciplinary field, although research to date is 
relatively limited in scope. AD research has typically been undertaken within translation 
studies and psychology, with activity also in museum studies, cultural studies, film 
studies, linguistics and disability studies. AD teaching in universities is usually situated 
in translation studies postgraduate programmes, as a component of AVT. This applies 
primarily to AD for screen (film and TV). Within translation studies, AD is regarded as 
a form of intersemiotic translation, which takes a nonverbal visual source text and 
translates it into a target text of spoken language (Jiménez Hurtado & Soler Gallego, 
2015). As such, AD shares common ground with any standard inter-lingual translation, 
in that it cannot simply replace each visual element with a verbal one, but it must adhere 
to an internal logic in order to be a coherent text in its own right. In screen AD, issues of 
timing and coherence are primary (Braun, 2011), as AD must fit into the gaps between 
dialogue and sound effects. Screen AD research is also developing as an inter-
disciplinary field, with researchers working across AVT and cognitive psychology in 
order to explore the impact of AD variables on the user (Ramos, 2016; Fryer & 
Freeman, 2013; Fryer, Pring, & Freeman, 2013; Walczak & Fryer, 2017). Research has 
used the construct of ‘presence’ (feeling as though one is in the mediated environment) 
in order to examine the success of varying approaches in screen AD (Fryer & Freeman, 
2013; Walczak & Fryer, 2017). Other studies spanning AVT and psychology have used 
physiological measures of emotion such as heart rate measurement in order to examine 
the effects of neutral or emotional language in AD (Ramos, 2016). 
Museum AD forms only a peripheral element of university teaching, if it is included at 
all. In the museum context, formal training and teaching of AD practices is often 
situated within the museum itself, with external AD trainers brought in to train museum 
staff on how to write and deliver AD tours. This reflects the heavily practice-based 
nature of AD as a discipline. The number of studies on museum AD is correspondingly 
limited, and the studies that have been published are primarily from the discipline of 
AVT. 
Research on museum AD to date has typically focused on translation related issues. 
These include questions such as how AD can approach the ambiguity of iconography in 
artworks (de Coster & Muehleis, 2007), or what the features of AD language may be, 

18 
 
 
when analysed through linguistic corpus analysis (Jiménez Hurtado & Soler Gallego, 
2015, Perego, 2019). Questions have also been raised regarding whether museum AD is 
more usefully considered a process of transcreation, whereby an equivalent but yet new 
artform is created (Hutchinson & Eardley, 2018; Neves, 2012).  
To date, the discipline of museum AD has not yet profited from collaborative and cross-
disciplinary research from AVT and cognitive psychology in the way that screen 
research has done, and empirically driven reception studies in museum AD do not yet 
exist. Thus, no generalisable findings about the impact of AD on BPS museum visitors 
are currently available to guide its future development. Furthermore, questions 
regarding the level of access it should seek to provide, whether this should be physical 
access only or also emotional, cognitive and social access, remain as yet unanswered. 
Given the overall tradition of siting AD in a translation discipline, these questions stand 
to be complex and problematic, as in translation terms these various approaches would 
call into question the nature of the source ‘text’ (the object or artwork) and the function 
of the target text (the AD itself) – and then necessarily the relationship between the two. 
The lack of empirical research on museum AD means that currently very little is known 
about how AD is received and assimilated by museum visitors. This applies to both AD 
delivered live in the museum or recorded AD, which is delivered via a device. It is 
recognised that the device, and indeed all aspects of it with which the visitor interacts, 
will have an impact on the user experience. In this sense, removing the content, i.e. the 
AD, and studying it in isolation, does not directly reflect the real-world experience of 
listening to AD within a museum. However, considering the lack of empirical 
understanding of museum AD, it was deemed critical to begin by isolating AD and its 
variables in order to develop a thorough understanding of the nature of AD itself, thus 
enabling the assessment of AD as inclusive design. 
Audio in museums: Audio Guides 
It has been claimed that almost every major and mid-sized art museum in the world has 
an audio guide for its permanent collection (Proctor & Tellis, 2003), and audio guides, 
alongside live tours, are arguably the main form of interpretation for visitors that does 
not rely on reading and vision. However, the research literature on audio guides consists 
of a relatively small number of predominantly qualitative studies, generally with low 
numbers of participants (e.g. Grinter & Woodruff, 2002) and there is correspondingly 
limited understanding about their wider impact on the visitor experience.  

19 
 
 
Conventional audio tours provide interpretation in the form of short bursts of 
information, typically 180 seconds per ‘stop’ (Aoki et al., 2002), and they have been 
shown to impact positively on visitor behaviour. One larger scale empirical study, using 
quantitative as well as qualitative methods, compared the behaviours of 42 students, 
half of whom visited the museum with an audio guide and half with no supplementary 
materials (Sung, Chang, Lee, & Yu, 2008). Observational data showed that the students 
with the guide stayed longer at exhibits and displayed more inquisitive behaviours than 
those without. Researchers have also observed that audio guides can help to draw 
attention to aspects of a display or setting that may otherwise go unnoticed, with one 
study observing that visitors crossed a large room to examine a detailed carving on a 
fireplace that was mentioned on the guide (Woodruff, Aoki, Hurst, & Szymanski, 
2001). However, audio guides have also been subjected to various criticisms. They have 
traditionally required visitors to wear a headset, which some users find problematic, due 
to comfort and weight, (Grinter & Woodruff, 2002), and which can cause users to reject 
them quickly. The headsets are also said to impede the visitors’ interaction with 
companions and with the museum environment (Aoki et al, 2002). This has historically 
led to concerns that audio tours can lock visitors into isolated experiential ‘bubbles’ 
(Aoki et al, 2002).  
In short, audio guides can help visitors to engage in the museum, by helping to focus 
attention, but they have a fine balance to strike between three potentially competing 
elements; the information source, companions and the physical environment – the 
guide, the friend and the room (Woodruff et al., 2001). Commercial audio tours, 
according to researchers, have not yet been able to provide, simultaneously, individual 
content over audio control, the ability to converse with companions, and the ability to 
share content. Some innovative research projects have started to address this gap. One 
project developed audio that was played through speakers and could be shared between 
visitors, facilitating interaction, but it was recognised that this was problematic to use in 
a busy space (Woodruff et al., 2001). Further work has developed audio guides which 
employ technology that allows visitors to share audio with each other or to listen to their 
companion’s audio, whilst listening with one earpiece only, permitting a sense of 
inclusion in the external environment (Aoki et al., 2002). The study from Aoki and 
colleagues (2002) observed companions engaging in more ‘story-telling’ behaviour, 
reporting more feelings of ‘connection’ and showing increased awareness of the room 
and its contents. 

20 
 
 
In summary, whilst audio guides are valued by museums and visitors as an educational 
resource and have responded to new innovations in digital and audio technologies, 
unanswered questions remain regarding their impact on the visitor experience. This is 
due to the relatively select number of studies, which have tended to undertake 
qualitative interviews with a small number of participants (e.g. Aoki et al., 2002; 
Grinter et al., 2002; Woodruff et al., 2001). Another potential issue with audio guides, 
yet to be addressed by empirical research, is the possible impact of the cognitive load 
placed upon users as they are required to attend to auditory information (what the guide 
is telling them) and visual information (what they see around them). Whilst audio 
guides may refer to prominent visual aspects of the work they are addressing, they do 
not systematically guide the user’s eyes from one detail to the next. This means that 
they may actually divide attention and increase cognitive load by requiring the visitor to 
attend simultaneously to competing visual and auditory information. AD, in contrast, 
systematically describes visual information in order that a blind user may create mental 
images of the object in front of them. If a sighted visitor were to use AD, then it has the 
potential to guide their looking – meaning that whilst their eyes are looking at one 
aspect of a work, they are also simultaneously hearing auditory information about that 
same aspect (Eardley et al., 2017). That is one key difference between audio guides and 
AD in terms of the experience they could provide a sighted user.  
Could AD benefit sighted visitors?  
There are three key aspects of AD that could potentially benefit sighted users. Firstly, it 
could help visitors to select and focus their attention as a kind of ‘guided looking’ 
(Eardley et al., 2017). Secondly, the language and content used in its construction has 
particular features which may impact upon engagement. Thirdly, AD typically seeks to 
stimulate the listener’s imagination through reference to all the senses (not just the 
visual).  
‘Guided looking:’ When considering the potential benefits of AD for sighted people, 
AD becomes less about translation of the visual into the verbal, but rather a way of 
guiding visual attention, or providing ‘guiding looking’. This is a process that we use 
instinctively in many situations where people need extra guidance on how or where to 
look; for example, when describing something during a phone conversation or when 
discussing a picture book with a child. In education, teachers or parents will describe in 
order to guide attention to details that may otherwise be missed; museum and gallery 

21 
 
 
staff will do likewise to encourage a visitor to stop longer at an artwork and to deepen 
their appreciation of it. In short, verbal description is something that we all do in 
everyday life.  
As discussed above, museums present a myriad of visual stimuli leading to a potentially 
overwhelming visual environment and ‘browsing’ behaviour exhibited by visitors. AD, 
in contrast, could offer sighted visitors the opportunity to select fewer objects, and to 
focus their attention on them, potentially drawing their attention to visual information 
they might have missed, and offering a deeper level of engagement in terms of how they 
attend. AD could also use ‘guided looking’ as a way to support visitors in directing their 
vision, providing information to encourage fixations on features that might otherwise go 
unnoticed by the untrained eye, thereby mitigating against the differences in viewing 
observed between experts and non-experts in the eye-tracking literature which was 
discussed earlier. In short, AD could help visitors to attend differently in the museum, 
and for these different patterns of attention to facilitate greater engagement. 
AD language and content: AD could potentially benefit all visitors through the style and 
content of the language it employs. AD practitioners are encouraged to use vivid and 
evocative language (RNIB, 2010). Investigations into the memorability of texts have 
found that content rated more highly by participants for emotion and imagery is better 
recalled (Sadoski, & Quast, 1990) and that emotional words are better remembered than 
neutral ones (Kensinger & Corkin, 2003). AD can also seek to stimulate curiosity 
through the use of narrative and thinking prompts which may encourage visitors to want 
to learn more; techniques which are advocated in the preparation of written 
interpretation material (Bitgood, 2013) and which have been suggested in AD (Neves, 
2016). Curiosity has also been shown to enhance memory for novel information (Kang 
et al., 2009).   
Multisensory information in AD: AD training courses run by AD organisations such as 
VocalEyes (UK) draw upon the expertise of practitioners to train museum staff in how 
to develop AD for their visitors. One technique that is frequently taught is the use of 
multisensory information in AD, with the aim of providing a kind of sensory 
stimulation that does not just rely on the visual sense. For example, when describing an 
image of a fire, an audio describer may talk about the smell of the smoke (olfactory 
information), the crackle and hiss of the flames (auditory information), rather than 
exclusively describing the colour of the fire and the light that it emits (visual 

22 
 
 
information) (VocalEyes training, 2016). Such techniques create imagery in the mind of 
the listener, which is important, as this provides a richer experience (engaging multiple 
senses), and can lead to better recall of the experience later (Eardley & Pring, 2006). 
Furthermore, some researchers and practitioners have started to experiment with 
enriching AD with other perceptual stimuli, such as sound (Eardley et al., 2017; Neves, 
2012). Theory from cognitive psychology can usefully be applied to these questions and 
speculations about the benefits of AD for sighted visitors.  
Cognition in the museum: imagery, multisensory processing, and 
memorability  
What is imagery? Mental imagery is quasi-perceptual experience, which resembles 
perceptual experience but takes place without the external stimuli (Cattaneo et al., 2008; 
Kosslyn, Behrmann, & Jeannerod, 1995). Memories themselves are formed of highly 
detailed sensory-perceptual information, much of which is held in the form of images 
(Conway, 2001; Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000) and indeed research has shown that 
imagery is a general predictor of memory specificity (Williams, Healy, & Ellis, 1999). 
Imagery is often predominately understood in everyday life as visual, with references to 
seeing ‘with the mind’s eye’; and in research, the emphasis on the relationship between 
imagery and memory has been on visual imagery (Brewer, 1986). However, imagery 
occurs across modalities (Eardley & Pring, 2014; McNorgan, 2012; Richardson, 1969), 
for example as auditory imagery (such as ‘hearing’ a piece of music in one’s own 
mind), tactile imagery (imagining the feel of something) or olfactory imagery 
(imagining the smell of something). 
Imagery from other, non-visual, modalities has also been shown to be important for 
memory retrieval (Eardley & Pring, 2006). This is particularly pertinent to congenitally 
blind people, who have never experienced visual imagery. If imagery were 
predominately visual, then they would be disadvantaged in forming memories. Eardley 
& Pring’s (2006) study with sighted and congenitally blind people demonstrated that 
this is not the case. This study sought to establish to what extent cross modality imagery 
was able to evoke autobiographical memories. Autobiographical memories are 
memories for personally experienced events, and they relate to one’s sense of oneself in 
space, time, society and culture (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). They can be 
specific memories (for specific events, ‘the day I…’) or general memories, (for general, 
often repeated events: ‘when I used to…’). This study’s interest was in the potential for 

23 
 
 
imagery to generate specific memories through the use of high-imagery cue words 
across the visual, auditory and tactile modalities. Results indicated that cue words in the 
visual and nonvisual sensory modalities all facilitated the generation of memories; 
generating more specific memories, and doing so more quickly, compared to the low 
imagery abstract cue words, which generated fewer memories in both the blind and 
sighted groups (Eardley & Pring, 2006). The effect of the imagery itself in memory 
retrieval could be isolated from an alternative theory of enhanced verbal processing in 
congenitally blind people, as no correlations were found between verbal ability and 
memory retrieval in either the blind or the sighted group. Therefore, imagery from 
nonvisual sensory modalities was shown to have generated memories in participants, 
regardless of their level of vision.  
This has important implications with regards to all kinds of audio interpretation, as the 
aim is that such interpretation will stimulate the user’s imagination through generating 
imagery. It is particularly important in AD, as AD uses imagery that stimulates multiple 
senses in its language to help BPS people form a mental impression of the object being 
described. This multi modal imagery is also potentially important to sighted users of 
AD, and could increase the long-term impact of the experience, as suggested by theories 
of multisensory processing. 
Multisensory processing: The environment in which we live and learn is multisensory. 
Humans perceive their environment through multiple sensory modalities and integrate 
the information in order to make the most efficient and beneficial decisions. 
Historically, sensory modalities were thought to function independently and separately, 
with specific brain regions being dedicated to vision, audition etc, but these theories on 
the modularity of perception are increasingly being revised e.g. (Shimojo & Shams, 
2001).  Over the last 20 years, researchers have confirmed that multisensory processing 
occurs both in higher order brain regions, but also in primary perceptual cortices 
(Ghazanfar et al., 2006). Researchers now question whether any brain region can be 
fully and exclusively characterized through its interaction with any single modality 
(Ghazanfar et al., 2006). Further evidence for this is provided by studies on plasticity in 
development, where impairment or disruption may cause particular ‘unisensory’ brain 
regions to respond to alternative modalities: the auditory cortex being driven by visual 
inputs, for example (Shams & Seitz, 2008). Research has shown that blind people, with 
both congenital and later acquired blindness, may undergo a massive functional cortical 
reorganisation, with visual cortex being activated by inputs from other sensory 

24 
 
 
modalities, for a review see Cattaneo et al. (2008). On a very simple level, even when 
information is held distinctly within one sensory modality, it can be applied in another. 
For example, we can know a shape by touch and subsequently identify it by sight 
(Levent & Pascual-Leone, 2014). 
Research has explored the impact on perceptual processing of presenting information in 
multiple sensory modalities, as opposed to in a single sensory modality, for example 
Laurienti, Burdette, Maldjian, & Wallace (2006). This study investigated whether 
multisensory presentation of stimuli would speed up perceptual processing time and 
improve accuracy in a discrimination task, in both younger and older adults. In this 
study, participants were asked to press a button indicating either ‘blue’ or ‘red’ in 
response to the stimuli shown. The stimuli were either unisensory, that is, entirely visual 
(a red or blue circle) or entirely auditory (the word red or blue verbalised); or 
multisensory (the circle and the verbalised word presented simultaneously). 
Multisensory presentation resulted in faster perceptual processing for both groups of 
participants. However, response times in older adults were improved in the multisensory 
condition to the extent that their performance was then equal to that of younger adults in 
the visual condition, which was the faster of the two unisensory conditions (visual and 
auditory). The findings for older adults have particular implications for the development 
of multisensory cues to reduce performance gaps between younger and older people.  
Multisensory Stimuli and Memorability: The act of remembering involves 
reconstructing a memory of an event from the representations of its initial encoding 
(Rissman & Wagner, 2012). Retrieval can be spontaneous, whereby it is triggered, for 
example, by sensory-perceptual information related to the original event, e.g. smelling a 
particular smell (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). Alternatively, it can follow from 
top-down conscious search processes (‘when was the last time I…’); where the 
individual is in intentional retrieval mode (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). When the 
perceptual stimuli that make up a representation are presented together, neural 
connectivity creates new associations that may facilitate future recall. In other words, 
stimuli that ‘fire together, wire together’ (Ward, 2014). Evidence shows that 
multisensory experience facilitates later retrieval of events (Gottfried, Smith, Rugg, & 
Dolan, 2004; Lehmann & Murray, 2005; Nyberg, Habib, McIntosh, & Tulving, 2000); 
which has important implications for learning. Research using fMRI demonstrates that 
multimodal stimulus combinations are neurally represented in the brain and become 
activated collectively even when the later stimulus is unimodal (von Kriegstein & 

25 
 
 
Giraud, 2006). This indicates that multimodal information facilitates the decoding of 
information from a single modality, which might in itself be insufficient for optimal 
retrieval (von Kriegstein & Giraud, 2006). 
This has been demonstrated across modalities. Gottfried et al (2004) asked participants 
to form associations or ‘stories’ between objects and odours. They then observed neural 
activity with fMRI when participants were later asked to identity the objects as either 
old (seen before) or new. No odour stimuli were delivered during the retrieval task, but 
primary olfactory (piriform) cortex was activated when old objects were successfully 
identified, that is, the objects previously presented with an accompanying odour 
stimulus. These findings supported the hypothesis that multiple traces increase the 
probability of later retrieval by partial or incomplete cues, giving the memory system 
greater flexibility (Gottfried et al., 2004).  
Similarly, the same benefits of cross modal learning have been observed in an auditory-
visual task (Nyberg et al., 2000). Participants were presented with either visual words 
only, or visually presented words paired with an auditory stimulus. Activation was 
observed in auditory cortex at retrieval, even though only visual cues were given with 
no accompanying auditory stimulus. Additionally, word recognition was stronger when 
meaningful word-sound pairs were given. Therefore, research on multisensory learning 
demonstrates benefits at later recall, even when the presentation of a later stimulus is 
unimodal (Gottfried et al., 2004; Kim, Seitz, & Shams, 2008; Lehmann & Murray, 
2005; Nyberg et al., 2000; von Kriegstein & Giraud, 2006). Later cues may reactivate 
similar cortical areas that were engaged during the encoding of the original event.  
The benefits of multisensory stimuli may be contingent to some degree on the level of 
congruency between them, (e.g. Kim et al., 2008; von Kriegstein & Giraud, 2006). The 
greater the congruency, the greater the multisensory gain and therefore the potential 
improvement in learning. Lehmann & Murray (2005) presented participants with visual 
and auditory stimuli that were either congruent (e.g. image of dog and dog barking) or 
incongruent (image of dog and bell ringing). They hypothesized that multisensory 
performance gains would be greater with the congruent presentations, with results 
confirming that the images that had been presented initially with semantically congruent 
sounds resulted in greater discrimination accuracy later. When pairs were semantically 
incongruent, it was thought that the visual stimulus activated one object representation 

26 
 
 
and the auditory stimulus activated a different object representation, which resulted in 
inferior performance at recall (Lehmann & Murray, 2005).  
A study by Kim et al. (2008) also investigated congruency in multisensory gains. Their 
participants were presented with a visual stimulus of an array of moving dots which 
were viewed with either no auditory stimulus present, or with congruent auditory 
stimulus (sound moving in the same direction as the dots) or incongruent auditory 
stimulus (moving in a different direction.)  After presentation of a sequence with two 
intervals, the group trained with congruent auditory-visual stimuli showed faster 
learning over the training sessions, providing evidence for the benefits of multisensory 
learning. The study sought to assess the possibility that increased attention due to the 
presence of sound itself might account for improved learning. However, in this instance, 
incongruent sound should improve performance as well as congruent sound, and this 
was not the case. The research on congruency in multisensory processing therefore has 
important implications for museums wishing to maximise the opportunities of 
multisensory learning, as it appears likely that congruent multisensory stimuli would be 
optimal in order to maximise later recall. 
Multisensory processing and learning in museums: It has been widely recognised that 
research on multisensory processing has important implications for learning (Dede, 
Salzman, Loftin, & Sprague, 1999; Kátai, Juhász, & Adorjáni, 2008), and indeed there 
is a long history and broad acceptance of the value of multisensory approaches in 
education (Department for Education, 2010; Reynolds, Vannest, Fletcher-Janzen, 2013). 
It appears likely that restricting stimuli to one modality only (e.g. text labels in a 
museum which employs only the visual sense) may represent a missed opportunity for 
learning for all museum visitors. Unisensory learning may simply be suboptimal 
(Shams & Seitz, 2008).   
Through utilising multisensory cues, museums may therefore improve the assimilation 
and subsequent recall of exhibitions in their visitors, with particular gains for older 
visitors; an important demographic in museum visitors, with a particular increase in 
some visitor segments such as grandparents with children (Beaumont & Sterry, 2005). 
A perceptual experience, such as smelling a particular smell, or hearing a particular 
sound, might trigger reactivation of a representation that in turn cues reactivation of 
other information (emotional, contextual) thus triggering the reconstruction of a 
memory.  

27 
 
 
Anecdotal evidence in museum research serves to illustrate these theories, with 
participants reporting memories linked to sensory representations such as the following: 
‘the room was very dark and smelled strongly like a doctor’s office or hospital’ (visual 
and olfactory imagery), ‘I went with my family to the Museum of Science and Industry 
– a very large building of classical architecture; style with columns, many steps and 
large doors’ (spatial and visual imagery), ‘mainly I remember the cafeteria…I 
remember the waterfall. I had to sit facing it. I loved the colours of the cafeteria – green 
and black with spots of gold light’ (spatial and visual imagery) (Falk & Dierking, 1990, 
p.98). As these basic examples serve to demonstrate, if representations are stored across 
multiple sensory modalities (for example, perceptual traces of what was heard, smelt, 
touched, seen) then this creates more possibilities for reactivation and subsequent 
retrieval upon encountering the appropriate cues. However, as the examples discussed 
above indicate (Gottfried et al., 2004; Nyberg et al., 2000), it is essential to consider the 
role of non-visual imagery as well as visual imagery, especially in an inclusive museum 
environment which aims to offer experiences and opportunities for those with varying 
sensory abilities. The nature of the multisensory stimuli in museums should also be 
carefully considered with regards to the provision of congruent information.  
In summary, psychological research on imagery, multisensory processing and its 
benefits for memorability all build the case to support the notion that AD could enhance 
the experience for all visitors, by increasing memorability and hence the lasting impact. 
In people who are blind and partially sighted, AD is a crucial form of access which uses 
rich, evocative language and sensory imagery to help visitors form mental impressions 
of collections. If AD were to be enriched with additional, perceptual stimuli such as 
extra sound, then this would provide a further layer of sensory enrichment for blind 
people. For sighted people, congruence is an important concept in the potential benefits 
of AD. As previously stated, in an AD facilitated experience, information would be 
delivered aurally as the sighted visitors’ eyes are being guided around the image. For 
example, as the AD draws attention to a particular visual feature, the visitor is hearing 
information about that feature. The congruent nature of AD presentation could therefore 
aid memorability, and this may offer an advantage over traditional audio guides where 
the visual and the auditory information are potentially competing rather than congruent. 
Perceptual enrichment, especially if congruent (e.g. sound of water to accompany an 
image of a lake), could enrich this further for sighted listeners also. Therefore, the body 
of research on multisensory processing and memorability in psychology adds weight to 

28 
 
 
observations and suggestions by practitioners that AD could benefit sighted as well as 
blind users (Synder, 2014). If this is indeed the case, then AD would have potential as 
an inclusive form of museum interpretation.  
It is important to contextualise this in broader notions of accessibility, which has been 
conceptualised as universal or inclusive design, amongst others. There is as yet little or 
no consensus regarding these definitions and how they are distinct from one another 
(Persson, Åhman, Yngling, & Gulliksen, 2015), meaning it is important to state a 
working definition for this thesis. 
Universal Design is generally defined as the concept of designing products and 
environments to meet people’s needs, regardless of their age, ability or status in life 
(Persson et al., 2015) and the term has been used with reference to museum 
interpretation for blind visitors, in Art Beyond Sight’s training materials (Art Beyond 
Sight, 2014). The concept of universal design is generally understood to have developed 
from architecture and the built environment (OCAD University, 2019; Persson et al., 
2015).  
Inclusive design, however, has developed from the digital realm (OCAD University, 
2019), where multiple and flexible entry points into a product are often possible, 
allowing for the multifaceted nature of human beings. Inclusive design therefore refers 
to design that considers the full range of human diversity (OCAD University, 2019), 
however it recognises that it is not always possible to design one product to meet the 
needs of all (Cambridge University, 2019, OCAD University, 2019). Furthermore, 
whereas universal design describes the qualities of a final design, inclusive design 
focuses on the process behind a design, with strong emphasis on the consultation of 
excluded communities (Holmes, 2019). The Design Council in the UK has thus defined 
it as a process of breaking down barriers and exclusion that will often achieve superior 
solutions, that may benefit everyone (Fletcher, 2006).  
AD, both as access and as a potentially inclusive form of museum interpretation, cannot 
seek to meet the needs of all visitors (for example, d/Deaf communities, or visitors who 
find language processing difficult.) It therefore seems appropriate, for the purposes of 
this research, to discuss the potential of AD as Inclusive Design, due to the possibility 
that a) AD when viewed as inclusive design may help to reduce the exclusion of BPS 
people in museums, b) the growing recognition in AD that reception studies are 
essential, thereby emphasising the contribution of user diversity to design of resources 

29 
 
 
and c) its potential to improve the user experience for a broader range of people.  
Exploring this possibility through empirical research is the central purpose of this thesis. 
This chapter will now go on to examine how the impact of an experience facilitated 
through AD, and a museum experience more broadly, can be measured and evaluated. 
This requires a deeper examination of memorability research in psychology, and 
specifically autobiographical memory. 
How can the museum experience, including AD facilitated experiences, 
be evaluated? 
This chapter has explored the nature of engagement in museums, and described how 
access to a museum experience, and to engagement, needs to consider not only physical 
access but also emotional, cognitive and social access. In order to understand how well 
access is being achieved, it is fundamental to seek out ways of evaluating the museum 
experience and levels of engagement. It is also important to develop measures that are 
generalisable beyond the sample of people within any given study, in order to be able to 
draw broader conclusions about the findings and to be able to provide robust 
recommendations to museums. Furthermore, this endeavour requires a set of measures 
that address the emotional, cognitive and social access needed to engage in the museum 
as well as the physical access.  
The museum memory research examined above differentiates between different types of 
memories, such as memories for facts and information compared to memories for 
personally experienced events (Medved & Oatley, 2000). This can be developed further 
by drawing on memory theory in psychology, which allows us to examine the full 
content of that experience and of levels of engagement – encompassing not only recall 
of information, but sensory impressions, emotions, thoughts, social interactions, and 
establishing connections to oneself or others. Autobiographical memory theory in 
psychology gives us a framework from which to develop a set of evaluation measures to 
address the full access picture. 
Introduction to autobiographical memory, its functions, and importance 
to museums 
Autobiographical memories are personal records of our lived experience that are 
constructed and reconstructed throughout the life span, and which are fundamental to 
our sense of self and identity (Bluck, 2017; Conway, 2005; Kihlstrom, 2009). 

30 
 
 
Autobiographical memories are central to our everyday functioning, as they form the 
bedrock of our concept of self (Bluck, 2017; Bluck & Liao, 2013; Conway, 2005), our 
social interactions (Alea & Bluck, 2003) and our future thinking (Bluck, 2017). 
The interdependence of self and memory has been described in the research literature 
where the self, or ‘working self’, is conceptualised as fluid and responsive to knowledge 
that one has about oneself (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). Thus, autobiographical 
knowledge (knowledge about oneself) governs what the self can be in the present 
moment or in the future, and the working self in turn modulates access to 
autobiographical knowledge, suppressing or promoting memories that present as 
(in)compatible with the goals of the working self. In this way, memories help to both 
construct and moderate our sense of who we are in the world. 
Similarly, autobiographical memories form the basis of our social relationships and an 
essential function of memory is to serve interpersonal communication (Cohen & 
Conway, 2007). We draw upon autobiographical memories in order to conduct our day-
to-day conversations and interactions, to share experiences with others, and to be able to 
mentally ‘transfer’ ourselves to another’s context (Cohen & Conway, 2007). 
Autobiographical memory is therefore fundamental to human relationships and to the 
ability to connect with others through social sharing and empathy. Research 
investigating participants’ reported uses of autobiographical memories found that the 
sharing of experiences with others, describing oneself to others and the sharing of 
information and advice were the most frequently reported uses (Hyman & Faries, 1992).  
Underlying both the social and identity forming functions of autobiographical memory 
is its directive function. Autobiographical memories of past events will influence and 
guide current and future behaviour (Cohen & Conway, 2007) and are fundamental to 
our ability to imagine ourselves in a different time or context (Conway & Loveday, 
2015). We therefore draw upon our autobiographical memories to understand our own 
identity, to interact with others around us, and to project ourselves into an imagined 
future when forming plans. Thus, personal autobiographical remembering is positive for 
human understanding and action (Bluck, 2017). 
The importance of autobiographical memories for museums is manifold. Museums seek 
to present narratives of the past (or present) to members of the public. Indeed, it has 
been argued that a primary function of museums is to address the ethical imperative to 
remember, from the perspective of preventing future repetitions of violent or traumatic 

31 
 
 
histories (Arnold-de Simine, 2013). Curatorial practices therefore seek to create 
museum environments which bring visitors face to face with the memories of others 
past and present, and which thereby promote empathy and understanding (Arnold-de 
Simine, 2013.). In this sense, museums tell stories (Bedford, 2001) much as works of 
literature, film, theatre or music may do, and they have the ability to promote cultural 
transmission – passing stories on from the past into the present, or from one group of 
people to another. These stories, in turn, will enter the array of environmental and 
cultural stimuli that contribute to socially constructed schema and thereby act upon 
visitors’ sense of identity.  Museum research and practice thus recognises that museums 
have a role to play in various aspects of a visitor’s identity (Falk, 2006, 2013, 2016). 
Furthermore, museums are recognised as being a place for social sharing and 
interaction, and museums actively seek to promote such interaction. In summary, 
memories are particularly important in a cultural environment like a museum, which 
seeks to preserve memories, and to create new memories for their visitors. 
This thesis argues that the content of autobiographical memories is also key to 
understanding the impact of a museum experience, and the level of engagement with it. 
The content of these memories consists of multiple types of information. Firstly, 
autobiographical memories are always contextualised spatially and temporally 
(Conway& Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). This means that they are memories for specific 
events that took place in a particular location and are situated within the rememberer’s 
sense of their own autobiographical chronology (when I was a child, last Tuesday, etc). 
Autobiographical memories are nearly always contextualised by information from the 
autobiographical knowledge base (Conway& Pleydell-Pearce, 2000), such as particular 
life-time periods (when I was at school, when I lived in X). This may be combined with 
semantic memory (knowledge about the world), personal semantic memory (knowledge 
about oneself) and episodic memories (memories for specific events). They are often 
rich with information from across sensory modalities (Brewer, 1986, Rubin, 2005, 
Greenberg & Knowlton, 2014, Conway, 2005, Eardley & Pring, 2006) and emotion 
(Holland & Kensinger, 2010) which theorists have termed SPAC: ‘sensory-perceptual-
affective processing’ (Conway, 2009). These elements of sensory imagery and emotion 
are considered to be ‘experience-near’ and can lead to a sense of re-living or re-
experiencing past events during the process of remembering (Conway, 2001).  
Thus, autobiographical memories may combine general elements such as knowledge 
about oneself with very specific elements of the original event, such as imagery (what 

32 
 
 
was seen or heard) or what was felt at the time. The way that these elements will be 
brought together and the memory thus reconstructed will be contingent on 
rememberer’s current concept of selfhood. The content of autobiographical memories 
therefore holds great potential for evaluation of the museum experience, and of also the 
aspects of engagement (physical, cognitive, social, emotional) that encompass access to 
the museum experience.  
By asking people what they recall about a museum experience, we can examine several 
aspects of that experience. Firstly, we can explore how rich their recall may be in terms 
of semantic information recalled, in sensory-perceptual traces of things seen, heard, 
touched, smelt or tasted, or in specific details of events that happened during the 
experience. Secondly, we can examine to what extent their memory of the museum 
event has been contextualised by information about themselves, which would indicate 
that the experience has enabled them to form a sense of connection with what they 
experienced in the museum. Thirdly, we can examine memories for evidence of 
engagement and impact such as emotion, or higher-level cognitive processing in the 
form of thoughts and reflections about the experience. Finally, we can evaluate the 
presence of other information that indicates engagement such as social interactions with 
friends, family or other visitors. In summary, analysis of autobiographical memories of 
museum experiences can allow us to gain a broad and detailed picture of the extent to 
which visitors have been able to access and engage with the museum and its collections. 
Furthermore, the use of empirical methodologies with inference statistics means that 
conclusions can be generalised to wider populations.  
Memorability measures can also be used to evaluate one component of what may be a 
broader memory representation of an overall experience; such as recall of a specific 
event within a museum visit. Different types of ‘learning’ may take place within a visit, 
such as incidental learning (what happens to be recalled) or intentional learning (i.e., 
what is encoded in response to instructions (Wagnon, Wehrmann, Klöppel, & Peter, 
2019). The current research is interested in learning that takes place within a museum 
experience. For example, by allowing people to experience an exhibit, without any 
instructions, and then later asking them what they may recall about it, we gain insight 
into what people happen to remember in the context of everyday memory (Cohen & 
Conway, 2007). In such instances, ‘learning’ may not be intentional, but may be 
incidental to the experience. Learning in museums may of course be intentional in 
situations where a visitor has come in search of information or has been asked explicitly 

33 
 
 
to find and remember facts and information (such as a school visit.) Memorability 
measures may reveal evidence of incidental or intentional learning having taken place. 
Such measures arguably have relevance and ecological validity in terms of museum 
settings where learning is in a free choice environment. 
Memories for a particular exhibit may also form part of a memory for an experience of a 
visit, which may be an autobiographical memory, if the episodic information has been 
integrated with knowledge about the self. Memorability measures, therefore, facilitate 
evaluation of both episodes (specific events in museums, such as seeing a particular 
artwork) and broader experiences (the overall event of a visit); with the potential to 
reveal evidence of learning and other forms of cognitive and emotional engagement. 
Such measures also allow for generalisation from samples to wider populations, thus 
responding to the challenge of expanding the unit of analysis beyond individuals, as 
discussed in the museum literature (Anderson et al., 2007) 
Summary  
This chapter demonstrated that a broad view of museum access should be taken, in view 
of the fact that many visitors may be primarily motivated by having an engaging 
experience at the museum. Access therefore needs to encompass the social, cognitive 
and emotional aspects of this experience, as well as physical access to collections. In 
order for visitors to have an enriching museum experience, engagement needs to occur. 
Understanding of levels of engagement can be developed through evaluation of aspects 
such as attention and interest, as well as enjoyment or emotional involvement. However, 
there are barriers to engagement, as suggested by the research literature. Most museums 
still typically rely on visitors looking at an object or artwork, with interpretation 
provided in the form of written labels. However, visitors may not know how to fully 
engage with a work just through the act of looking, whether or not they have sight. 
Visitors may also spend very little time at any one exhibit, suggesting that engagement 
can be minimal. Audio interpretation may enhance engagement through encouraging 
visitors to spend longer at exhibits. AD may offer an advantage to sighted users over 
traditional audio guides due to its ability to guide and prolong visual attention, as well 
as engaging the listener through multisensory imagery or perceptual enrichment. This 
therefore suggests its potential as a tool for inclusive design.  Evaluation through 
memorability could provide valuable understanding about the nature of visitors’ 
cognitive, emotional and learning experiences in museums and what the lasting impact 

34 
 
 
of those experiences may be. This may take the form of evaluating museum experiences 
through autobiographical memories, or specific experiences facilitated through AD, 
whereby episodic memory for a specific event is being explored. This research seeks to 
evaluate the impact of experiences: impact being defined here as the lasting memories 
of an experience, with evidence of cognitive or emotional engagement. 
The structure of this thesis 
Chapter 2: Understanding museum AD: current practices, regional differences and 
implications  
This chapter is in two parts. The first part presents the findings of a survey with 
museum audio describers (Study 1) and addresses the question: what experience is 
museum AD trying to facilitate and how can it do it?  The contents of the first half of 
this chapter form the basis of an article recently accepted by the Journal of Visual 
Impairment and Blindness (JVIB). The second half of the chapter considers some of the 
debates raised by the results of the survey, and explores these in the context of AD’s 
‘home discipline’ of AVT. This part forms the basis of an article published in 2018 in 
Perspectives: Studies in Translation Theory and Practice (please see page ii). This first 
study reveals a spectrum of opinion regarding what AD is aiming to achieve in 
museums – whether it aspires to be an objective visual-verbal ‘translation’, or whether it 
should ‘recreate’ works and collections to provide a rich experience.  
Chapter 3: Autobiographical memories of museum visits: using autobiographical 
memory theory to explore museum experiences and their lasting impact 
This chapter presents a coding model for evaluation of museum memories, drawn from 
autobiographical memory theory. It presents the results of analysis of museum 
memories from 80 participants (Study 2), and discusses the types and content of 
autobiographical memories, their distribution across the life span, and the implications 
for our understanding of memories for cultural experience. The chapter seeks to explore 
the nature of the museum experience and the application of autobiographical memory 
theory as a tool for evaluation. It is therefore addressing the question: how can the 
museum experience can be understood and measured? An article based on the content 
of this chapter has recently been submitted for consideration by Memory.

Chapter 4: ‘Guided looking’: supporting visual exploration of artworks with audio 
description 
This chapter presents results from an experiment exploring the use of AD by sighted 
people (Study 3). This study was conducted with 150 sighted participants and it 
considers the experience of, engagement with and memorability for a photography 
exhibition presented with either AD, a standard audio guide, or no audio. It investigates 
whether AD can facilitate a different kind of experience in sighted people, and if so, 
what benefits this may have. The research question of this chapter is: does AD have an 
impact on the experience and engagement of sighted people, and on the lasting impact 
of the experience? 
Chapter 5: The impact of enriched audio description on the exploration of Henry Grant 
photography, in people with and without sight 
This chapter builds on the findings of Chapter 4 by enriching the AD with perceptual 
stimuli. It compares sound enriched AD to standard AD, and examined the impact on 
the experience, engagement and memorability of 40 blind and 40 sighted people. Its 
research question: would sound enrichment of AD have engagement and memorability 
advantages in the context of inclusive design? It thereby explores what constitutes 
optimal AD for an inclusive audience. 
Chapter 6: Revisiting inclusive experiences facilitated through Audio Description 
This chapter draws together the research findings to re-evaluate the core research 
question: how might AD support access to an engaging museum experience for visitors 
with and without sight? It discusses implications of the thesis and avenues for future 
research.

Chapter 2:  Understanding museum AD: current 
practices, regional differences and implications 
 
Abstract 
An exploration of the potential of museum AD as a tool for inclusive design needs to 
start with an understanding of current practices within museum AD, which is currently 
under researched. This chapter therefore addresses how museum AD is currently 
understood and provided around the world in order to explore how concepts of museum 
AD may support a broad notion of access as access to an engaging experience. The 
chapter is divided into two parts. Part A reviews the current guidelines for museum 
describers. It then presents the findings from a survey of international museum AD 
practitioners, examining practitioner perspectives on museum AD, in order to better 
understand the ways in which museum AD is used to enhance access. It explores 
regional differences (Europe, US) in AD traditions, focusing on imagery, meaning, 
emotion and degrees of objectivity. These findings demonstrate that European 
describers have higher agreement with the use of interpretation in AD than US 
describers. Part B undertakes a theoretical exploration of the debates and questions 
raised by the survey, including the principle of objectivity, in the context of AD’s 
‘home discipline’ of translation studies. It draws on what can be learnt from the AD 
screen literature and translation theory more widely, in order to explore the objectivity 
principle in the museum context.

Part A: Towards an understanding of international 
museum audio description practices: practitioner 
perspectives 
 
Introduction 
In order for museums to fulfil their obligations under the Equality Act (2010), they must 
make ‘reasonable adjustments’ in order to offer accessible services. However, despite 
the importance of AD as an access tool, an audit within the UK showed that only 5% of 
museum websites mentioned live AD tours and only 3% of museum websites 
mentioned recorded AD guides (Cock et al., 2018). Whereas screen AD is fully 
regulated by guidelines (Fryer, 2016) and the research literature is comparatively more 
developed, museum AD is a relatively niche segment of the overall AD provision. It has 
not yet been professionally developed to the same extent as screen AD. Despite the 
complexity of the museum experience, only a small number of international AD 
guidelines provide any museum-specific AD advice. European guidelines that address 
museums come from the pan-European ADLAB project (Remael, Reviers & 
Vercauteren, 2014) and the Spanish Standard UNE (RNIB, 2010). From the United 
States, there are recommendations from the Audio Description Coalition (ADC), 2009) 
and from Audio Description International (ADI) (see RNIB, 2010), the latter 
incorporating input from Art Beyond Sight and Art Education for the Blind. 
Comparison of these guidelines reveals points of regional commonality and differences. 
Firstly, the guidelines reveal contradictory advice regarding the level of subjectivity that 
is acceptable in museum AD. The practice of AD in the US has typically placed greater 
emphasis on the requirement for objectivity (Mazur & Chmiel, 2012; Fryer, 2016) 
compared to European practice. This is often summarised as ‘WYSIWYS’ – ‘what you 
see is what you say’ – a phrase introduced by Joel Synder (Snyder, 2014), Director of 
the American Council of the Blind’s Audio Description Project. Thus, US training 
materials addressing AD applications more broadly call for objective recounting of the 
visual aspects of an image (ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010), and US describers are cautioned 
against evaluation or interpretation (Mazur & Chmiel, 2012.) 

38 
 
 
The picture for museum AD guidelines is more mixed. Some US guidelines encourage 
describers to include subjective aspects, such as the mood or atmosphere of a piece 
(ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010; ADC, 2009), or to explore interpretative approaches to a 
work such as soundscapes (ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010). ADC also suggests its readers 
consider verbal description, which they distinguish from objective audio description 
owing to the inclusion of evocative information (ADC, 2009). However, objectivity is 
still urged in some US training materials for museums, by leading organisations such as 
Art Beyond Sight (Art Beyond Sight, 2014), and it is possible that the greater emphasis 
on objectivity in US AD may provide context for museum AD practice in this region. 
European approaches to AD overall are understood to be more open to the use of 
interpretation, with acceptance of the idea that objectivity will always be hampered by 
individual ways of perceiving reality (Mazur & Chmiel, 2012). Museum AD guidelines 
are limited, but again may be contextualised by this different emphasis in European 
practice. For example, the ADLAB guidelines recommend ‘deconstructing’ a work and 
‘recreating through suggestive language, sounds effects and music’, and explicitly state 
that interpretation is required along with contextualization and selection (Remael et al., 
2014, p.71; see also Neves, 2012).  In contrast, the Spanish standards explicitly state 
that personal interpretations should be avoided (UNE 153020, cited in RNIB, 2010). 
However, this statement is complicated by the advice that describers should focus on 
the most significant information for understanding the work, which is necessarily a 
matter of subjective interpretation.  
The museum AD guidelines also differ in their approaches to AD construction and 
delivery. There is limited advice about the optimal length of a description. The 
American ADC recommendations (2009) emphasise that it takes more time to listen to 
information than it does to view or read it, and they encourage selection and focus on 
details that are pertinent to understanding and appreciation of the work. The ADLAB 
project suggests that a recorded description should be 1-2 minutes (Remael et al., 2014), 
in order to take account of visitors’ attention span. However, in the research literature, it 
has been suggested that a small number of works could be selected with twenty minutes 
dedicated to each (Soler Gallego, 2018). 
Specific advice on content suggests AD should present a variety of information, 
including factual information (Remael et al., 2014), information about the artist’s 
technique, such as brushwork (Remael et al., 2014; ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010), and use 

39 
 
 
of colour and tone (ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010; ADC, 2009; Remael et al., 2014). 
ADLAB recommend putting facts before description, saying that ‘description brings 
facts to life’ (Remael et al., 2014, p.81), although the authors recognise that sometimes 
different types of information should be interwoven. US guidelines, in contrast, tend to 
recommend keeping the verbal description distinct from other kinds of information (Art 
Beyond Sight, 2014; ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010). 
The guidelines also address language and how best to structure a description. Language 
should be clear, simple, direct and precise (Remael et al., 2014; ADI, cited in RNIB, 
2010) but simultaneously vivid and diverse (Remael et al., 2014). Interestingly, the US 
ADI recommendations for general AD practice describe it as a ‘literary art form…a type 
of poetry, a haiku’ (ADI, cited in RNIB, p.75), which seems to be at odds with the 
principle of objectivity, or ‘what you see is what you say’ (WYSIWYS), which is also 
advocated throughout the AD literature (see, for example, Snyder, 2014) . Nevertheless, 
the use of literary devices is not widely discussed, although ADC (2009) does caution 
describers only to use metaphor if it is likely to be familiar to the audience.  
All guidelines (excepting the Spanish Standard UNE 153020) explicitly state that the 
description should move from the general to the specific. Various ways to structure a 
description are proposed (ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010, ADC, 2009; Remael et al., 2014), 
including the use of clock face numerals (RNIB, 2010, ADC, 2009), describing things 
in the order in which they appear (ADC, 2009), segmenting a painting by foreground, 
middle ground and background (ADC, 2009) or choosing a sequence that will highlight 
the work’s main features (Remael et al., 2014).  ADC explains that it is important to 
help people to understand the ‘spatial relationship between things’ (ADC, 2009, p.21).  
This emphasis on structure is related in some guidelines to the construction of mental 
imagery (ADC, 2009; Remael et al., 2014), with ADI explaining that the sequencing of 
information will allow ‘a blind person to assemble, piece by piece, an image of a highly 
complex work’ (ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010 p.99). The ADLAB recommendations refer 
to helping visitors who are blind to ‘see’, stating: ‘at times, the DG (descriptive guide) 
will lead to “seeing” through positioning, movement or touch’ (Remael et al., 2014, 
p.70). Likewise, ADI refer to appealing to other senses such as touch or hearing to help 
construct ‘highly detailed impressions.’ All the guidelines cited here furthermore 
advocate the accompanying use of touch in AD practice, where possible. 

40 
 
 
The guidelines recognise that offering BPS visitors a rewarding museum experience 
involves balancing a number of practicalities and artistic decisions. However, the advice 
specific to museum AD is limited and at time contradictory. Furthermore, the limited 
museum-specific advice means that museum AD is necessarily contextualised by a 
broader AD tradition with governing principles of objectivity, which may prove 
problematic, considering the sometimes ambiguous nature of museums’ collections and 
the complex nature of the museum experience. In order to understand how AD may 
address a broad concept of access in the sense of access to an engaging experience, it is 
firstly essential to understand how museum AD is currently understood and provided. 
This study presents findings from a survey of museum audio describers, which explored 
the role of AD, as part of the museum experience, and the content of AD.  Based on the 
different developments of AD in Europe and the US, responses were compared from 
regions to establish the degree of practitioner agreement. 
Method 
Design 
A questionnaire, comprising of fixed choice and free-text responses, examined the 
experience and approaches of museum Audio Describers (please see Appendix 1.1). 
Quantitative analysis grouped participants into ‘Europe’ and ‘US, comparing responses 
to questions based on a 5-point Likert scale. Where multiple tests were carried out, the 
Bonferroni-holm correction was used. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the 
qualitative data recorded in the free-text response boxes, due to its potential to uncover 
patterns of meaning across a dataset in a relatively under researched area (Braun & 
Clarke, 2006).  
Participants  
Forty-one describers and one AD trainer responded to an online survey. Describers were 
recruited through convenience sampling via VocalEyes, (UK), through Audio 
Description Association (ADA) directories (UK), the US based Audio Description 
Project (ADP), and via snowball sampling. Respondents were from 12 countries: UK 
(16), US (14), Spain (2), Portugal (2), and one response from each of the following: 
Brazil, Belgium, France, Ireland, Poland, Canada, New Zealand, and Italy.  For the 
regional quantitative analysis, participants were grouped into Europe (25) and US (14), 
with insufficient data to permit a ‘rest of world’ category. All nationalities were 

41 
 
 
included in the qualitative analysis. All participants were active and current practitioners 
of museum AD, one offered training only. The research followed British Psychological 
Society ethical guidelines, and was approved by the University of Westminster 
Psychology Department ethics committee. 
Measures 
An online questionnaire (see Appendix 2.1) requested basic demographic information, 
and respondents were asked for the ideal duration for an individual description or ‘stop’ 
(live/recorded) and for an entire AD tour. Describers were asked to comment on the use 
of touch to accompany AD. 
A series of statements about the role of AD were rated using a five-point Likert 
agreement scale. These addressed AD as a way of ‘seeing’ or ‘understanding’ an 
artwork/artefact, and whether it should explore meaning, give background information, 
create an emotional experience or an engaging narrative. 
Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to rate the importance of aspects of content and 
style such as references to colour, the use of factual and contextual information, the use 
of multisensory imagery, inclusion of technical information, use of literary devices such 
as simile or metaphor, building a narrative, dealing with measurements (either by using 
standard metrics, or by relating the item to part of the body),  and finally the use of 
‘thinking’ or ‘conceptual’ prompts for the listener. 
Respondents were given the opportunity to add comments and reflections in free-
response boxes. 
Procedure 
Participants completed the questionnaire online, via Qualtrics. Once informed consent 
had been given, participants completed the questionnaire. No time limit was given, and 
the duration would have depended on the amount of free-text response that was 
provided.  Further, although names were not requested, if participants wanted to receive 
a summary of the research findings, they were asked to leave their email address. 

42 
 
 
Results 
Qualitative analysis  
Online questionnaires were transferred into NVIVO software for coding.  Thematic 
analysis was carried out within a constructivist framework, whereby it is not assumed 
that one ‘truth’ can be extracted from the data. Rather, knowledge is constructed by 
drawing patterns from the individual experiences and meaning described by 
participants. The creation of themes was nevertheless driven by a deductive approach 
(Braun & Clarke, 2006). Specifically, the areas of difference identified within the 
quantitative analysis were used as a starting point for the creation of themes within the 
qualitative data. As such, the qualitative analysis is used to elaborate on and enrich 
understanding of the quantitative analysis.  
Data were first broadly examined in the context of areas of agreement and disagreement 
between audio describers. A second phase of analysis explored sub themes within 
agreement and disagreement. Within agreement these included themes of:  'selection for 
description', 'information sources', integration of information', 'role of curators', 
'describing gallery space', 'structuring a description' and 'language and narrative.' Within 
disagreement, the themes included: 'neutrality and objectivity' and 'cognitive prompts'. 
The final stage of analysis extracted a broad theme of ‘interpretation’. This incorporated 
all the sub themes from the ‘disagreement’ category and the sub theme of ‘imagery’ 
within the agreement category.

There was a wide range of responses on AD duration.  Mann-Whitney U pairwise 
inferences tests for full tours and single stops for live and recorded indicated no 
significant differences across nationalities (all p>.40).

Use of touch 
Over half of the respondents in both the European and US groups commented on the 
importance of touch alongside AD. Both groups emphasised its sequential nature and 
the time needed to allow people to discover through touch. The European group 
recognised some practical difficulties, but emphasised that touch could ‘make objects 
come alive’, and enhance the tour’s narrative when well executed.  
Role of museum AD 
Table 2.2 shows that for the first four of the seven statements about the role of AD, the 
median value is the same or similar across geographical regions, indicating agreement 
in the US and Europe. Statistical inference tests (Mann Whitney U test) confirmed a 
lack of difference between these ratings (all p>.1).

The statement ‘AD should provide understanding’, had a higher mean value for 
European respondents, but a larger range of responses in the US, and did not reach the 
conventions for statistical significance: (U=122.50, N1=24, N2=14, p=.17). The 
Europeans attributed greater importance to the role of both meaning and emotions in 
AD. Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed these differences were significant (Meaning: U 
=91.00, N1=24, N2=14, p=.03; Emotion: U = 89.50, N1=24, N2=14, p=.03).  
Within the qualitative theme of 'interpretation', sub themes relevant to the role of AD 
were: ‘imagery’ and ‘objectivity vs interpretation’. 
Imagery 
There was broad international agreement that the primary function of AD was to 
facilitate the creation of a ‘mental picture’ of the artwork or object in the listener’s 

45 
 
 
mind. Many comments referred to concise, vivid language that would be able to ‘create 
a full picture in the listener’s mind’s eye’ (#36, US). One European describer warned 
that other aspects of style should not be prioritised at the expense of the creation of 
imagery: ‘if it creates an engaging narrative but it doesn't give the listener a picture of 
the object, it's failed as AD even if it's succeeded as a narrative.’ (#25, UK). Another 
European respondent mentioned that creating mental imagery required a certain 
structure in the description, with each piece of information adding incrementally to the 
construction of a mental image: ‘It is important to keep a logical order in the description 
of the different elements, building relationships through them, in order to make a 
composition, or a mental image’ (#35, Spain). Various structures were proposed, with 
the clock numerals method favoured by US respondents.  
Discussions about mental imagery were, for some, at the heart of what AD should set 
out to do. One such respondent was careful to distinguish the creation of imagery, 
which was specific to AD, as entirely distinct to discussions of context and meaning, 
which were considered the domain of the museum staff, not the describer: ‘The work of 
the audio describer is to audio describe. He or she is not there to replace the work of a 
docent. The describer must tell what the work looks like, he must use the tools to 
elucidate the image in the mind's eye of the constituent’ (#18, AD trainer, rest of world). 
One European describer gave a different perspective on mental imagery, reporting that 
mental imagery creation, or even the desire for it, could vary widely between visitors. 
They suggested that AD should focus on providing a rich experience, rather than aiming 
to substitute visual information with an image: ‘The idea of AD… is not to say 'if you 
could see, you would see this'. That is terribly disabling. It's not possible for everyone to 
have the same picture in their mind, and AD will never achieve that, even if all blind 
and partially sighted people were making pictures in their minds, which they tell me 
they're not. It's not to remind them what they've lost, surely it's to introduce them to 
something they've never encountered before’ (#1, UK).  
Objectivity vs interpretation 
As shown in the quantitative data, there were significant regional differences of opinion 
regarding interpretative aspects of AD. However, the qualitative data revealed world-
wide concern about keeping the right balance between objectivity and interpretation. 
Despite higher ratings in Europe for statements about meaning, understanding and 
emotion, there was still focus on maintaining objectivity and creating minimal

‘interference’ in the listener’s assimilation of an artwork: ‘I would go easy on the 
creation of an emotional experience – the artwork does that, not the describer’ (#23, 
UK). However, there was more emphasis amongst European describers on the role of 
story-telling in AD, with all mentions of narrative coming from European describers. 
Describers from the US held much stronger views on objectivity, with many defining 
the role of the describer exclusively as a ‘translator’ of visual information, separating 
this entirely from a creative or artistic process, as expressed here: ‘The task of the 
describer is to describe the visual aspects of an object, production, or experience. 
Creating emotion alters the experience and is inappropriate for the describer. The 
describer is providing an assistive service and should not attempt to create or influence 
the artistic effect’ (#12, US). Many comments from US describers emphasised 
objectivity: ‘Audio description is speak what you see. In my opinion, the describer's 
interpretation should not be a part of the description’ (#38, US). For some, the ideal was 
for the describer to be a competent but essentially invisible agent by which the visual 
information is experienced by the recipient, leaving interpretative aspects to the 
museum professionals: ‘The audio describer is not there to explain what the work is, 
what it means. He or she is there to bring to the mind's eye of the recipient, the visual 
event he or she, audio describer, is seeing’ (#18, AD trainer, rest of world).  
Content and style 
Content and Style: Table 2.3 shows broad agreement across geographies on the 
importance of the majority of content and style variables. Only ‘cognitive prompts’ was 
identified as significantly different by Mann-Whitney U tests across nationality groups; 
considered to be more important in Europe than in the US (cognitive prompts: U = 
85.50, N1 = 21, N2 = 14, p= .04; all other differences p>.2.

Table 2.3 Importance of Content and Style Variables by Region (Median, Range), where

International agreement across the majority of variables of content and style was 
broadly supported by the qualitative data. Specifically, there was agreement between 
describers in all regions that AD language must be simultaneously evocative and 
concise, and that vivid language would best generate mental imagery. There was also 
agreement between regions that the use of literary devices such as metaphor could be 
problematic, as they could generate competing mental images. However, there were 
interesting regional differences in the emerging theme ‘interpretation’, within the sub 
theme ‘cognitive prompts’:    
Cognitive prompts  
Comments from the US indicated that cognitive prompts were not a recognised part of 
AD. One US describer, for example, rejected the idea of ‘thinking prompts’ because 
they were outside the remit of an audio describer, and too close to interpretation: 
‘Incorporating "thinking" and "conceptual" questions is not, in my opinion, appropriate 
for a describer; that lies in the domain of a docent. (Keep in mind that I describe in the 
United States, and we emphasize respecting the integrity of the original material and 

48 
 
 
avoiding attempts to interpret it for the person who's listening to the description’ (#12, 
US). For another US describer, thinking prompts were potentially problematic if they 
would result in a different experience: ‘Embedding the description with thinking or 
conceptual prompts or questions should only be done if you are doing the same thing for 
your sighted patrons’ (#40, US). In contrast, European describers seemed to view 
cognitive prompts as a creative aspect of description with the potential to enrich the 
listener’s experience. One UK professional stressed the importance of finishing 
recorded description with a ‘surprising or amusing fact’, in order to leave the visitor 
with ‘something memorable… to take away’ (#30, UK). Similarly, another UK 
describer talked about how they liked to end their descriptions with something which 
would leave a hint of suggestion in the listener’s mind – leaving them with ‘something 
to ponder’ (#21, UK). 
Discussion 
The aim of this study was to understand similarities and differences across international 
museum AD practices, with particular reference to the role of museum AD and its 
optimum content, style and duration. It drew on a mixed methods approach, using 
qualitative findings to deepen understanding of the quantitative findings. The results 
suggested that where international guidelines agree, for example on structure and 
language, international museum AD practices have much in common. International 
practitioners tended to agree that the average duration of an AD description could be 
longer than the 1-2 minute recommendation in the guidelines (Remael et al., 2014). The 
aspects of AD which were most contentious, such as observing strict objectivity, 
reflected some contradictory recommendations in the guidelines. The discussions 
around these issues highlighted some crucial international differences about what 
museum AD should set out to achieve.  
Quantitative and qualitative responses from describers from the US indicated that most 
describers prefer to reduce subjective interpretation as far as possible. These describers 
considered their role to be the ‘translation’ of visual perceptual information (e.g. the 
colours, the shapes, the structure). This approach is more consistent with the US 
tradition of objectivity (WYSIWYS).   On the other hand, Europeans were more likely 
to reference strategies that might evoke a deeper sense of meaning, for example, 
cognitive prompts, narrative, or seeking to evoke emotion. European describers also 

49 
 
 
placed more emphasis on touch as part of the AD experience and its potential to tie in to 
the story-telling function of a description. 
Interestingly, the qualitative data suggested that one of the objectives underlying the use 
of cognitive prompts or emotions, was to make the experience more memorable. 
Curiosity has been shown to be instrumental in helping us to remember, as curiosity 
enhances memory for novel information (Kang et al., 2009). The use of cognitive 
prompts, if they stimulate curiosity, may therefore aid memorability. They have also 
been proposed by AD researchers exploring ways of enriching AD (Neves, 2016). The 
use of emotions also relates to the generation of meaning, and enhances memorability 
(e.g. McGaugh, 2003). The question of whether or not providing meaning is a didactic 
process, or a way of encouraging a deeper level of processing, is consistent with the 
broader museum interpretation debates. Such debates continue to question how much 
explanation is necessary or appropriate in the museum (Pekarik, 2004). Empirical 
research is needed to explore what effect this trade-off between objectivity, intervention 
and curiosity might have on the listener experience, and the resulting levels of 
engagement. 
Although the use of mental imagery attracted much agreement internationally, it is 
interesting to note that many describers discussed enabling their listeners to create 
mental images of objects– ‘having a picture’ in one’s mind. This phrase, commonly 
used by respondents, is generally understood to mean a visual image. The focus on 
visuo-centric imagery is an interesting one. People who are late blind may have ongoing 
access to residual visual imagery in the form of memories, and partially sighted people 
may continue to form new visual imagery as they access new visual information 
through their residual sight. For individuals who are congenitally blind with no residual 
vision from birth, visual imagery is not possible. One might argue that the purpose of 
AD is not simply to provide people who have had vision with access to information 
which may be stored within memory, it is also to provide information to people which 
can be understood without ever having had access to vision.  
As with our perceptual experience, mental imagery is experienced in all sensory 
modalities, including auditory, haptic, kinaesthetic and olfactory (Cattaneo et al., 2008; 
Eardley & Pring, 2006; Eardley & Pring, 2014). Within AD, imagery, like perception, 
can be multisensory. For example, grass has a visual form, but it also has a tactile form, 
a spatial form (covering a surface), and an olfactory form. Agreement with this 

50 
 
 
approach is reflected in the international agreement with the use of multisensory 
imagery in AD. These views are consistent with the US guidelines, which discuss ways 
in which tactile or auditory imagery can be embedded in order to create a richer 
description. However, in recommendations and materials for describers, it would be 
valuable to expand upon and illustrate the multisensory nature of imagery and its role in 
description wherever possible. 
The role of spatial imagery was reflected in the findings by the comments of many on 
how they structure an AD. Research has demonstrated that people who are congenitally 
blind perform similarly on spatial imagery tasks compared to sighted individuals 
(Eardley & Pring, 2007; Eardley et al., 2016). How this spatial representation can then 
be enriched, or ‘brought to life’, can be achieved through the spectrum of non-visual 
sensory imagery (taste, smell, touch, movement) that is experienced by people who are 
blind and sighted alike (Eardley & Pring, 2014).  However, providing the structure to 
facilitate a mental representation can take significant time and word count within an AD 
text, or live delivery (Jiménez Hurtado and Soler Gallego, 2015). Keeping in mind the 
challenges of retaining attention and not overloading the listener with information, it 
would be interesting to explore the tolerance of AD users in terms of the time and effort 
needed to process structural information in sufficient detail to form a mental 
representation. Some users may wish to do this, others may prefer to experience the 
artwork in a way that does not require them to invest significant mental effort in 
forming such a representation. Other tools such as simplified tactile images can help 
provide access to basic spatial representations, with AD then enriching the spatial 
structure. 
Mental imagery formation has also been shown to aid memorability (e.g. Svoboda, 
McKinnon, & Levine, 2006), and an AD text that generates strong and enduring mental 
images could therefore provide a longer lasting and potentially more fulfilling 
experience. However, whilst multisensory engagement, such as enrichment with 
additional sounds, has the potential to explore meaning and evoke emotion, it requires a 
more interpretative approach and moves beyond a strict provision of visual information. 
Upholding the objectivity principle should therefore be critically reviewed in the 
context of providing a rich and engaging experience. 
The results of the present research demonstrate broad international agreement on the 
building blocks of Museum AD, such as the use of colour, multisensory imagery and 

51 
 
 
the generation of mental imagery. At the same time, the conflicting views between 
regions on interpretation in AD foreground the many different things that AD could aim 
to do in a museum; provide verbal description of visual elements, create mental 
imagery, tell a story, explore meaning and evoke emotions. As guidelines for museum 
describers develop and the role of the describer continues to be professionalised 
(ADLAB Pro, 2019), exploring these tensions, which are so central to the source texts 
of museums and galleries, will be crucial in the development of museum AD. In 
summary, approaches to description will vary according to whether AD is understood as 
a visual to verbal translation, or as a museum interpretation tool which seeks to facilitate 
an experience. This chapter will now go on to examine this question in the context of 
AD’s ‘home’ discipline of Audio-Visual Translation. 
 
 

52 
 
 
Part B: Translating the Museum: AD and the 
implications of textual fidelity 
Introduction 
The practitioner survey showed that there are divergent approaches between US and 
European describers with regards to interpretation in museum AD, and indeed the role 
of museum AD more broadly (Part A). The second part of this chapter explores this 
debate further in the context of the discipline within which AD historically sits (AVT). 
It considers what can be learnt from the screen AD literature, particularly with regards 
to cross-disciplinary reception studies. Furthermore, it considers the objectivity debate 
in the context of translation theory.  
In translation terms museum AD is an intersemiotic translation, from nonverbal visual 
language to spoken language (Jiménez Hurtado & Soler Gallego, 2013), whereby the 
visual information of the artwork or object is the source text and the verbal language of 
the description is the target text (Jiménez  & Soler Gallego, 2015; Soler Gallego, 2015). 
As with any form of translation, the process of translating the source text into a target 
text requires making a number of practical and artistic decisions. Translation decisions 
facing audio describers working in a museum context have received some, albeit limited 
attention in the research literature to date. Some of the translation processes undertaken 
by museum describers are revealed through corpus analyses of existing museum AD 
texts (Jiménez & Soler Gallego, 2015, Perego, 2019). Jiménez and Soler Gallego’s 
(2015) analysis, for example, compared an AD corpus with a corpus of audio guide 
texts for sighted visitors. Their finding showed that verbs in the category of ‘position’ 
were used more frequently in the AD texts, indicating more words being used to 
describe the spatial position of visual elements (eg ‘stand’, ‘face’, ‘hang’). In contrast, 
the AG texts contained more verbs in the category ‘cognition’ (eg ‘think’), suggesting 
that the increased use of lexical items related to visual composition and spatial position 
occurs at the expense of other word categories. Peregro’s (2019) analysis revealed an 
unexpected level of complexity in AD language, with technical terms, heavy adjectival 
phrases and long sentences being frequent features. Other research on museum AD has 
considered translation decisions such as possible approaches to the translation of 
ambiguity in artwork (de Coster & Muehleis, 2007, Neves, 2012), or the use of tactile 

53 
 
 
resources to accompany AD and thereby provide intermodal coherence (Soler Gallego, 
2018).  
However, to date, the majority of research studies addressing the translation challenges 
facing audio describers have focused on screen (for example, Braun, 2007, 2011; 
Ramos, 2016; Matamala & Remael, 2014). Some of these explorations have crucial and 
concrete implications for museum AD, but some of the challenges for museum 
describers are different. The translation decisions addressed in the screen AD literature 
that have relevance to museums can be broadly grouped into three categories (although 
these categories are frequently interdependent): (1) those that relate to objectivity and 
the visibility of the describer-translator, (2) those that are specific to and contingent 
upon the source text and (3) translation decisions that have direct implications for the 
experience of the recipient. Here, the relevance of the existing screen AD research for 
the museum context is examined, and it is argued that the translation of the visual 
aspects of a museum’s artworks and artefacts brings with it new considerations that are 
as yet largely unexplored, and that are central to the development of museum AD.  
Objectivity and the visibility of the describer-translator 
Some of the fundamental translation decisions faced by both screen and museum 
describers can be usefully contextualised within the wider discipline of translation 
studies, where they have been more broadly debated. These decisions relate to 
objectivity and the visibility of the translator in the provision of the target text; in other 
words, how the translator leaves traces of their translation decisions, and hence of 
themselves, in the texts that they create. These decisions are particularly pertinent to AD 
due to the requirements for objectivity that pervade the professional guidelines for 
screen (see RNIB, 2010). These recommendations equate objectivity in AD with 
quality, and state that interpretation on the part of the describer is obstructive and 
undesirable: ‘the best audio describers objectively recount the visual aspects of an 
image. Subjective or qualitative judgements or comment get in the way – they constitute 
an interpretation on the part of the describers and are unnecessary and unwanted’ 
(Audio Description International’s proposed guidelines for Audio Description, cited in 
RNIB, 2010, p. 76. Emphasis in the original.) 
 In light of such guidelines, which are often contradictory in nature (Mazur & Chmiel, 
2012; Ramos, 2016), AD, like any other form of translation, needs to consider its 

54 
 
 
position with regards to questions of subjectivity and interpretation, and to what extent 
the translator-describer could or should aim to be a silent voice in the provision of the 
target text. Considering its close association with translation studies, it is unsurprising 
that AD as a discipline has been grappling with the spectrum of objectivity and 
interpretation throughout its history (Fryer, 2016). This is consistent with the general 
principles of fidelity to the source text/author and principles of trust between the 
translator and the receiving audience that have dominated translation ethics and practice 
for hundreds, if not thousands, of years (Chesterman, 1997). Indeed, professional 
translation bodies today continue to require translators to work by the principles of 
objectivity and equivalence, with this ethical position of translators being taken 
somewhat for granted (CIOL, 2017; Van Wyke, 2010). Historically, it has been argued 
that translators should be ‘invisible, a window through which the original could shine 
unimpeded’ (Chesterman, 1997, p. 152).  
However, these demands on translators have been more critically examined in the light 
of post-modern thinking, which claims that translation is always a transformative act 
(Venuti,2003). If meaning is not regarded as a stable entity embedded in texts, ready to 
be extracted (Fish,2006), then it becomes something that is attributed to texts, via an act 
of interpretation (Van Wyke, 2010). In this view, translators (describers) cannot be 
invisible facilitators through which a target text is made available to audiences; rather, 
they are agents of change, each ‘in a unique life-situation with a unique state of 
knowledge and cognition, with unique personal history’ (Chesterman, 1997, p. 149). If 
translators inevitably leave traces of themselves and their decisions in their texts, then 
this reverses the traditional understanding of ethics in translation and instead calls for 
reflexive examination of their visibility. As Van Wyke emphasised, if  
…translators embrace the fantasy that they can be completely objective and 
invisible, then they will not critically look at the role they are actually playing. 
By acknowledging their visibility, translators can begin to […] examine the role 
their work plays in cultural mediation. 
 
 (Van Wyke, 2010, p. 113). Nevertheless, although it may be argued that complete 
objectivity is impossible in AD, there is still signiﬁcant debate within the screen AD 
literature regarding the degree of subjectivity that is permissible. What constitutes 
subjectivity is, of course, in itself subjective. In a small-scale study with AD users, 

55 
 
 
Mazur and Chmiel (2012) found that whilst 54% stated that they did not accept 
subjective interpretations, there was a spectrum of opinion regarding the subjectivity of 
various examples (‘smart shoes’, for example). 
 Furthermore, there are differences in AD practice across regions, with the American 
AD tradition tending to advocate a stricter view of objectivity – often quoted with the 
acronym WYSIWYS – than is the case in European-based practice (Fryer, 2016; Mazur 
& Chmiel, 2012). In their consideration of interpretation in AD, Mazur and Chmiel 
(2012) recognised that although subjectivity is generally regarded as undesirable in the 
AD guidelines, there may be instances in which a certain degree of interpretation can 
ease the cognitive load on the visually impaired viewer. In order to examine the binary 
nature of the objective–subjective discussion and evaluate the objectivity of the 
narrative accounts given, they performed an analysis of the narrative behaviour of 
sighted viewers of a film sequence from the Pear Tree Project. Their findings showed 
that whilst moral judgements were rare, a certain amount of interpretation occurred 
across all three scenes analysed, leading the researchers to suggest an objectivity–
subjectivity scale in AD, rather than a binary understanding of the two.  
The objectivity principle has been further discussed in the screen AD literature in the 
context of new methodological approaches such as audio narration (AN), which has 
been explored as an alternative to AD. Drawing upon the principles of narratology, AN 
keeps the emphasis on the what, as opposed to the how, of audio description. AN 
requires the describer to select the discourse elements that are considered to hold the 
most narrative force and to contribute most significantly to the mental model that the 
describer constructs as they view the film (Vandaele, 2012). The aim of the AN 
approach, as Vandaele (2012) described it, is that describers will develop a self-
reflexive awareness of their mental state and the triggers that helped to generate it. Once 
these triggers have been identified, the describer will be better equipped to create an 
equivalent mental state in the blind or partially sighted viewer. As Vandaele (2012) 
recognised, narrative force is therefore based as much upon the state of mind of the 
film’s recipient (starting with the describer) as it is upon the discourse of the film itself.  
Additionally, the elements that contribute most strongly to mental narrative models may 
not consist of the dominant visual features of what is seen on screen; they may be 
minor, subtle or elusive, but yet pivotal in building states of uncertainty, curiosity and 

56 
 
 
suspense. Therefore, the identification and prioritisation of such triggers inevitably 
introduce an inherent level of subjectivity to an AN approach. 
Debates regarding subjectivity are intensified in the context of museum AD, where the 
existing research recognises the urgency of addressing issues of ambiguity and 
subjectivity (De Coster & Muehleis, 2007) and acknowledges that museum AD must be 
developed and addressed in a different way to film AD, where objectivity has 
historically been the aim (Neves, 2012). In museum AD, questions of objectivity and 
the visibility of the describer are particularly pertinent due to the nature of the source 
text itself. 
The nature of the source text 
One key difference between museum AD and screen AD is the interdependence 
between source and target text. In screen, the target text must be seamlessly integrated 
with the source text, which requires it to fit exacting timing constraints as the AD 
should not typically interfere with the dialogue or soundtrack of the film or programme 
(see RNIB,2010). This integration poses several challenges for the describer. The time 
available for the AD utterances may be short, and will therefore put pressure on 
language choice. Some timing-saving devices may be regarded as overly interpretative, 
and so are actively discouraged in international AD guidelines (see RNIB, 2010). For 
example, evaluative adjectives such as ‘beautiful’ or ‘ugly’ may be advantageous in 
terms of concision, but are open to criticism in terms of the layer of interpretation that 
they bring (Mazur & Chmiel, 2012). Similarly, the naming versus the describing of 
facial expressions presents the same tension between concision and interpretation. 
However, it has also been argued that some emotional states or facial expressions are 
universal enough to merit the short-cut of naming them (Mazur & Chmiel, 2012) and 
furthermore, that naming them (versus describing the pieces of information of which 
they consist) can reduce the processing load of the audience (Braun, 2007; Mazur & 
Chmiel, 2012).  
Closely linked to the problem of timing is coherence, which must be preserved in the 
audio-described film, as indeed it must in any other translation (Braun, 2011). In screen 
AD, this means addressing not only the visual elements of the film, but helping the 
recipient to make sense of the relationships between the film’s audio and visual 
elements. Screen AD therefore aims to convey cross modal links between images and 

57 
 
 
sound and image and dialogue, without which the sense of the film may be lost (Braun, 
2011). 
The translation challenges are very different in a museum context. Whereas screen AD 
is never designed to be a stand-alone product, museum AD often will be. The 
description may be hosted online, and accessed outside the museum, or it may be 
delivered to a visitor with no sight in the museum, who is likely to be standing in front 
of an untouchable object behind glass. Even in the instances when a visitor may make 
use of residual vision in conjunction with hearing the description, there is not the same 
need to integrate the target text with audio elements of the source text. The source text 
in a museum, whether an artwork or an object, does not provide the same challenges of 
coherence and timing of utterances, although timing is still a concern in terms of the 
duration of the AD text and its ability to retain the listener’s attention, with estimates of 
optimal duration ranging widely (Part A) and as of yet untested by empirical research. 
Despite the apparent differences between the source texts of films and the source texts 
of museums’ collections, some of the source-text related translation challenges 
addressed in the screen AD literature are relevant to museum AD, in terms of the 
process and its relationship with objectivity. These relate to the selection of material and 
the emphasis given to it. In screen AD, visual features appear on the screen 
simultaneously, whereas the verbal description that seeks to represent them is linear, 
requiring describers to make decisions about which aspects to describe, in what order, 
and which links (if any) to make between them (Braun, 2011). In a narratology-based 
approach to film AD, selection of material must also consider the narrative relevance of 
visual information, which must create the balance needed between realized and 
hypothesized action if states of curiosity, suspense or surprise are to be initiated in the 
viewer (Vandaele, 2012). 
 Decisions regarding the selection of material and the emphasis given to it are also at the 
heart of museum AD, where practitioners aim to create an experience for the BPS 
visitor that is comparable to that of their sighted counterparts. Selection and 
prioritisation of the source text(s) is multi-layered as museum describers must select 
objects at both a macrotextual (exhibition as text genre) and microtextual level (objects 
and their relation to one another) (Jiménez Hurtado & Soler Gallego, 2013). These 
decisions present a number of pragmatic and artistic challenges. Firstly, the sheer 
number of potential objects for description, and their diversity, is overwhelming. 

58 
 
 
Describers often work with museum staff to select source texts that a) are believed to 
best represent the museum’s exhibition narrative, b) which also lend themselves to vivid 
description and c) are believed to most accurately represent the experience of sighted 
visitors. Weighing up these (sometimes conflicting) aspects is a complex decision-
making process, often involving multiple stakeholders, not just the describers 
themselves. 
Not only must describers select source texts within the museum, but they must then 
decide which aspects of visual information within them are key to the blind visitor’s 
assimilation of that particular artwork or artefact. Professional museum AD guidelines 
urge describers to select ‘pertinent details’ (see RNIB, 2010, p.100) but with limited 
advice to suggest how this might be understood or applied. Furthermore, the nature of 
the source texts in museums and galleries, typically artworks and artefacts, may be 
visually complex and/or highly ambiguous, presenting a challenge to any visitor in 
terms of their assimilation.  
This has led to a focus in the limited museum AD research literature on possible 
approaches to ambiguity and subjectivity (see Eardley et al., 2017). In their exploration 
of intersensorial translations of visual art, de Coster and Muehleis (2007) consider the 
spectrum of ‘visual intensity’ of artworks. They suggest that whereas some clear signs 
can be named in words in a relatively straightforward manner, ambiguous elements may 
be best represented in another sensorial field such as touch or hearing. Similarly, Neves 
(2012, p.1) questions whether ‘words are sufficient to convey the subtleties of art’ and 
calls for visual ambiguity to be conveyed through another sense like touch or non-verbal 
sound such as music. These approaches indicate that museum AD may share common 
ground with transcreation, the term used to describe the re-creation of multimodal texts, 
for example corporate websites (Rike, 2013). Similarly, ‘re-creation’ is proposed as an 
alternative to a literal translation in poetry translation (e.g. Jones, 2011), indicating that 
differing source texts may lead translators to differing solutions. However, translation 
decisions such as these stand to place the describer-translator at odds with the AD and 
translation traditions which have historically advocated objectivity.  
Furthermore, it could be argued that the source texts in museums and galleries are not 
only the artworks and artefacts themselves, but the sensory experience of looking at 
them. In other words, our understanding of ‘source text’ in a museum context might be 
expanded to include the space and architecture of the museum, the experience of being 

59 
 
 
in the space and interacting with others within it, in other words, the wider experience 
of visiting a museum.  
The recipient experience 
Increasingly, reception studies in screen AD research have been placing the emphasis 
on the recipient’s experience of the target text. This emphasis resonates with thinking in 
Translation Studies such as Skopos theory (Reiss & Vermeer, 2014), which suggests 
that the translator should focus on the end-user of their translation, and take decisions 
based on the text’s skopos or purpose, thereby positioning texts as ‘communicative 
occurrences whose form is determined by the situation in which they occur and by the 
persons who use them’ (Nord, 2010, p.127). In screen AD research, where audiences are 
central to a large number of studies, the question of purpose is increasingly recognised 
as broader and more complex than the provision of access to visual information.  
The experience of watching a film is likely to be much more than a comprehension of 
the narrative as it unfolds on screen. The artistic decisions of the director, such as the 
filmic techniques used, may also influence the impact of the film on the sighted viewer 
and their level of immersion. Fryer and Freeman’s (2013) analysis therefore addressed 
the recommendations of Ofcom (2017) to avoid filmic terms by comparing the 
reception of a standard AD with a cinematic AD. The latter not only used filmic terms 
but also utilised the audience viewpoint in the first-person plural (‘towards us’ etc.), 
thereby promoting a sense of the social experience of viewing that occurs in theatre or 
cinema. Congenitally blind people preferred the standard AD (83%). However, visually 
impaired recipients who had lost their sight after the age of 35 unanimously preferred 
the cinematic AD. Furthermore, participants with no useable vision reported stronger 
engagement and higher levels of spatial presence and ecological validity with the 
cinematic AD, in other words, the addition of filmic techniques gave them a stronger 
sense of immersion in the film and thereby a more rewarding experience (Fryer & 
Freeman, 2012). In further research, the use of cinematic AD was combined with 
subjective descriptions in a ‘creative’ AD, and compared with a ‘standard’, neutral AD 
that drew upon the WYSIWYS principles (Walczak & Fryer, 2017). ‘Creative AD’ was 
preferred by 67% of participants and resulted in higher reported presence levels, that is, 
having the subjective experience of being in the depicted environment (Walczak & 
Fryer, 2017). 

60 
 
 
Understanding how best to create an equivalent filmic experience for visually impaired 
viewers involves seeking a better understanding of how sighted audiences make 
narrative meaning from audio-visual texts (Kruger, 2012). Using eye-tracking with 
sighted viewers of the ‘Pear Tree’ film (Chafe, 1980), Kruger (2012) recorded the 
participants’ fixations on varying visual elements and comparing these with the depth of 
understanding as reported through their retrospective accounts of the narrative. The 
findings showed higher cognition scores for participants who looked more frequently at 
visual elements that were low in terms of visual salience (less prominent on screen) but 
high in narrative salience (of importance in understanding the development of the 
narrative). If narrative salience should be prioritised over visual salience in order to best 
promote an equivalence of experience (Kruger, 2012), then this analysis also challenges 
the oft-quoted maxim of WYSIWYS, as saying what is predominately seen may not be 
what is most important when it comes to giving blind audiences access to a filmic 
experience (see also Finbow, 2010). 
The recent emphasis on the audience experience within screen AD research has also led 
to investigations of the importance of emotion (Ramos, 2016; Ramos, 2015). Ramos 
(2016) compared an AD for film, written in a neutral style, to an audio narration (AN) 
which was embedded with more emotional language, thereby permitting the use of 
inferences, literary devices such as metaphor, and subjective evaluation of the describer 
in order to address the crucial question of whether emotional content could help to 
stimulate the ‘powerful emotional experience’ offered by the cinema (Ramos, 2016). 
Heart rate measurements and user evaluation measures revealed significant differences 
in the reception of ‘neutral’ AD and ‘subjective/emotive’ AN, with recipients having a 
stronger emotional reaction to the AN for scenes of fear and sadness. Such results 
suggest that the benefits of a focus on the audience response may outweigh the benefits 
of a traditional strict observation of the objectivity principle. 
 This emphasis on experience as the desired outcome of AD raises the question of 
whether AD should be an ‘informative or descriptive text’, or whether it should take a 
‘more active role in meaning-creation’ (Ramos, 2016).  These are key questions to 
examine in a museum context, and relate closely to the discussion of the source texts in 
museums. If museum AD seeks to offer not just access to visual information, but access 
to a museum experience, then the nature of that experience needs to be fully evaluated. 
This raises the question of whether AD may consider expanding its remit beyond the 
provision of visual information. 

61 
 
 
Four categories of experiences in museums proposed in an early study on the museum 
experience (Pekarik, Doering & Karns, 1999) raise interesting questions for the further 
development of museum AD, as a means of accessing an engaging museum experience: 
(1) Object experiences focus on something outside the visitor, and include seeing ‘the 
real thing,’ seeing rare or valuable objects, and being moved by beauty. 
(2) Cognitive experiences include the interpretive or intellectual aspects of the 
experience, such as gaining information or knowledge, or enriching understanding.  
(3) Introspective experiences consist of private feelings and experiences, such as 
imagining, reﬂecting, reminiscing and connecting. 
(4) Social experiences focus on interactions with friends, family, other visitors or 
museum staff. 
By these categorisations, if museum AD is understood primarily as a translation of 
visual information, or even as a vehicle by which the listener constructs mental imagery, 
as encouraged in AD guidelines (RNIB, 2010), then it seems designed above all else to 
address the category of ‘object experiences’— enabling visitors to ‘see’ rare or valuable 
objects. However, if AD also aims to impart knowledge, or enrich understanding, then it 
addresses cognitive experiences, and if it is aiming to evoke emotions in the listener, 
then it has a role to play in introspective experiences. An interaction with the describer 
or fellow listeners in live AD also forms a social interaction in the museum setting. If 
AD wishes to provide access in the sense of facilitating an experience for BPS visitors, 
then all of these categories of experience must be brought into consideration. From this 
perspective, the remit of AD may extend beyond the translation of visual to verbal 
information, necessitating further exploration of what AD stands to gain or lose if it 
moves away from traditional translation ethics of strict objectivity. Furthermore, this 
requires further analysis of the role of the describer-translator, and the extent of the 
visibility of their translation decisions. 
Discussion 
The possibility of accurate and objective representations of visual information (fidelity 
to the source ‘text’) must be held up to examination, and balanced with fidelity to an 
alternative source ‘text’ – the museum experience itself. Similarly, the visibility or 
presence of the describer (translator), rather than being minimised and discouraged, 

62 
 
 
might be usefully explored in the context of the translation ethics debates where 
visibility and traceability of decisions can be regarded as an alternative, and 
advantageous, ethical position (Chesterman, 1997; Van Wyke, 2010). Although 
museum AD is generally considered by academics as ‘on the fringes’ of traditional 
AVT (Díaz Cintas & Neves, 2015), translation theory, particularly with regards to 
translation ethics, may provide useful frameworks for future thinking. 
Poetry translation theory holds particular relevance for museum AD, with its concerns 
of ambiguity and subjectivity, and the comparison between AD and poetry is by no 
means a new one (Fryer, 2017; Santos, 2015). Just as poetry has textual features (such 
as linguistic patterning, word play and ambiguity) that a translator may want to 
preserve, it also has a ‘communicative function’, which may be to ‘entertain, or to give 
a heightened emotional or intellectual experience’ (Jones, 2011, p.117). In the same 
vein, the museum itself can be considered a communicative event (Jiménez Hurtado & 
Soler Gallego, 2013) and many museum ‘texts’ will have textual ‘features’ – either 
linked to their materiality (form, shape, size, colour, texture), their method of 
construction, display, or their intended use. Similarly, these texts or objects may have a 
communicative function, either in and of themselves, or one assigned by the museum in 
order for the object to play its part in constructing a narrative for the museum visitor 
(Dudley, 2012). How these communicative functions are interpreted and assimilated 
will always be highly contingent on an individual’s socio-cultural context and 
circumstances (Dudley, 2012, Dierking & Falk, 1992). Describers need to balance the 
tensions between the contingency of human experience and the materiality of the 
museum context, as Dudley (2012, p.12) neatly frames it:  
Two different people will certainly demonstrate the subjectivity and contingency 
of experience by responding to the same object in different ways… but for both 
of them, part, at least of their engagement with the object will be determined by 
its material characteristics – their reactions would not be as they are (whatever 
they may be) if the object were not what it is’’ (emphasis in the original). 
The discipline of poetry translation proposes various frameworks to navigate these 
tensions between textual features and communicative functions, such as literal 
translation, adaptive versions and recreative translations (Jones, 2011). In poetry 
translation, ‘re-creation’ may try to ‘recreate a source poem’s semantic and poetic 
features in a viable receptor-language poem’ (Jones, 2011, p.118). The word ‘viable’ is 

63 
 
 
particularly pertinent to museum AD where the target text needs to be able to stand 
entirely alone, in the case of a description that is delivered to someone with no sight, or 
delivered remotely via online hosting. However, the fuller sense of what constitutes 
‘viability’, and how a successful description may be assessed, is a complex question that 
might be usefully approached from multiple angles. The potential that AD holds to 
create access not only to the materiality of an object but to its communicative function 
means exploring access not only to things but to engagement. In other words, if an AD 
aims to provide the recipient with equivalent access to an experience in the museum, 
which may be comprised of both elements of materiality and elements of 
communicative function, then the evaluation of museum AD needs to move beyond an 
assessment of its success as a visual to verbal translation.  
Museum AD, at first glance, appears to have little in common with its older sibling of 
screen AD, with the latter’s historical focus on objectivity and textual coherence. 
However, in the screen AD research literature, increasing attention is being paid to the 
recipient experience, with the use of psycho-physiological measures in conjunction with 
traditional AD reception surveys, and new creative approaches to description itself. For 
museum AD, research with visitors will need to explore what AD needs to do to create 
access to experiences which may range from assimilation of visual information such as 
hues, structure and shape, through to emotional and cognitive experiences of viewing 
art, social interactions with family and friends, learning experiences, entertainments and 
escapism. Practitioners of museum AD will need tools at hand to help them navigate the 
tensions between fidelity to the ‘source text’ and providing access to the museum 
‘experience’. Assessing this experience in full could mean extending the traditional 
view of AD as a visual to verbal translation and embracing the creative possibilities of 
re-creation for museum AD, exploring the success of new approaches in the context of 
visitor engagement and memorability. 
Summary 
This international survey of museum audio describers presents the first empirical 
exploration of museum AD practices around the world. The findings revealed differing 
opinions about interpretation in AD between two major AD traditions: the US and 
Europe, with European describers giving more importance to factors such as addressing 
meaning or creating emotion in AD, or using cognitive prompts.  It is likely that these 
differences are underpinned by the pervading emphasis given to the objectivity principle 

64 
 
 
in the wider discipline of AD, particularly in the US. Furthermore, there is contradictory 
advice in the museum AD guidelines regarding interpretation. The resulting challenge 
for museum describers is how to make optimal translation decisions that best convey 
their ‘source text’. In translation terms, this means considering whether the source text 
is restricted to the artwork or object itself or whether it addresses the wider museum 
experience. If the source text is to be understood as the museum experience, then this 
requires a potential shift in current thinking about museum AD purely as a translation of 
visual information. AD may need to incorporate a broader view of access as access to an 
engaging experience, comprising of cognitive, emotional and social elements as well as 
physical access to the visual appearance of the collections. If AD is to address the 
broader museum experience, then this necessitates a deeper understanding of what that 
experience is and how it may be measured. In order to develop this further, this thesis 
will now turn to an investigation of the nature of the museum experience, through 
analysis of personal memories for museum visits.

Chapter 3: Autobiographical memories of museum 
visits: using autobiographical memory theory to 
explore museum experiences and their lasting impact 
 
Abstract 
The previous chapter challenged the nature of the ‘source text’ of museum AD, by 
arguing that AD should facilitate access to the broader ‘museum experience’. However, 
before this can be achieved, the museum experience itself needs to be better understood. 
The museum memory literature is yet to develop measures that allow for generalisable 
conclusions to be drawn about the museum experience and its impact. This chapter 
explores the museum experience through analysis of participants’ memories for 
museum visits, using measures drawn from autobiographical memory theory.  
Autobiographical memory, namely our memories for events throughout our lives, is first 
contextualised within a broader explanation of human memory. Its key features and 
functions are presented, and their relevance to museums is discussed. The chapter then 
presents a coding model developed from the autobiographical memory literature, and 
discusses the findings following analysis of 80 participants’ museum memories; with 
participants grouped according to age and the frequency with which they visit museums. 
The distribution of museum memories across the participants’ lifespan is discussed. 
Memory specificity, the presence of ‘special’ memories and memory content are also 
explored. The results on the life span distribution of memories suggest the importance 
of our leisure activities for our identity and social interactions, and differences between 
frequent and infrequent visitors suggest the importance of early experiences in 
museums. Results on the content of memories demonstrate that there is consistency 
between visitors in terms of the content recalled, indicating a hierarchy of content that 
makes up the enduring impression of a museum visit. Within this hierarchy, information 
about what is experienced and learnt in the museum, contextualising information which 
relates this to the rememberer’s knowledge about themselves, and personal reflections 
are particularly salient. Some variations between participant groups in the content 
recalled and the types of memories are consistent with the research literature on 
autobiographical memory and ageing.

Introduction 
In order to understand autobiographical memory and the rationale for its use in museum 
evaluation, it is first necessary to contextualise it within the wider field of memory 
research. Autobiographical memory is part of the long-term memory system. Long-term 
memory covers time periods from just a few minutes ago to as far back as we can 
remember (Goldstein, 2011) and it can take the form of either declarative memory 
(explicit, conscious memory), or nondeclarative memory (implicit, non-conscious) 
(Nyberg & Tulving, 1996; Squire, Knowlton, & Musen, 1993). Whereas declarative 
memory is memory for facts and events, nondeclarative memory is memory for skills, 
habit learning, classical condition and priming and nondeclarative memories are 
expressed through performance rather than through recollection (Squire et al., 1993). 
This thesis is interested in understanding what memories visitors retain of a museum 
visit, hence the focus on long-term, declarative memory. Whilst a museum visit could 
undoubtedly have a non-conscious impact on a visitor, such nonconscious memory 
traces are outside the scope of this research.  
Within long-term, declarative memory, there are distinct types of memories. Semantic 
memory refers to general knowledge about the world. It is the memory necessary for the 
use of language, and it has been likened to a mental thesaurus, as it is a complex 
organisation of one’s knowledge of words and other verbal symbols, their meanings and 
the complex relations between them (Tulving, 1972). Semantic memories are 
decontextualized and are not temporally defined. For example, a semantic memory of a 
pen might typically include its visual features (colour), visuo-haptic features (such as its 
shape, its weight in the hand) and information such as where one typically sources a pen 
(shops) and its function (to write with). Semantic memories therefore contain 
knowledge about the world; its people, places, objects and the meanings of things, and it 
is also knowledge that can be shared culturally. As such, the retention of such 
knowledge has been considered an important measure of learning for museum research 
(see Koran, Koran & Ellis, 1989, for a review).  
In contrast to semantic memories, episodic memories are contextualised, through being 
defined both spatially and temporally. Episodic memory is memory for events, and each 
experienced event occurs at a particular spatial location and in a particular temporal 

67 
 
 
relation to other past, simultaneous or future events (Tulving, 1972). Furthermore, these 
memories are records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing which are 
derived from working memory (Conway 2005). Episodic memories are important for 
the experience of ‘recollective experience’, which is the sense of the self in the past. 
This is due to their highly sensory-perceptual nature. The role of episodic memories in 
‘recollective experience’ is a key one, as they are believed to help the rememberer to 
understand that what they are recalling is a memory of a real, lived event, rather than a 
dream, plan or fantasy (Conway, 2001). However, the distinction between episodic and 
semantic memory is blurred, as semantic knowledge can be accumulated by abstraction 
from personally experienced events or episodes (Cohen & Conway, 2007). Thus, the 
two are regarded as being in an interactive and interdependent relationship (Cohen & 
Conway, 2007). 
What is autobiographical memory? 
Considering a memory for a personally experienced event helps to illustrate the 
different aspects of memory. For example, knowing that Paris is the capital of France is 
an example of semantic memory. Recalling a visit to Paris with a friend, or an event 
within that visit, such as a museum visit or meal out, would likely involve multiple 
episodic memories in the form of memories of sights and sounds, personal reflections 
and social interactions. The memory of the visit overall would also be an 
autobiographical memory, as it would be likely to integrate recall of events within a 
broader framework of knowledge about oneself (e.g. ‘friendship with x’ or ‘when I was 
studying French’). 
Autobiographical memories are memories for personally experienced events, which 
may be general, repeated events (going to the park as a child) or specific events (the day 
that I started school). They are typically reconstructed from multiple types of 
information, including semantic memory (knowledge about the world) personal 
semantic memory (knowledge about oneself) and episodic memories (memories for 
events which have a spatial and temporal context). They may be rich with imagery from 
across sensory modalities which can provide a sense of re-living past events (Conway, 
2001). However, autobiographical memories typically fade over time, becoming less 
vivid and accessible.  
The theoretical life span curve of autobiographical remembering consists of three 
components (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). Firstly, childhood amnesia, which 

68 
 
 
shows a decline in access to autobiographical memories typically before the age of 5 
years (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). Secondly, the reminiscence bump, which 
shows a robust concentration of memories between the ages of 10-30, and has been 
widely documented in the research literature (Conway, Wang, Hanyu, & Haque, 2005; 
Janssen, Chessa, & Murre, 2006). Thirdly, a period of recency, which shows a powerful 
effect of availability of recent memories (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). 
Autobiographical memory and the self-memory system: 
Autobiographical memories are thought to be constructed from an underlying 
knowledge base that is comprised of various layers of information and themes (Conway 
& Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). The multiple structures that comprise the autobiographical 
knowledge base contain specific types of memories. Episodic memories are one layer of 
information (e.g. handling replica dinosaur bones – how they looked and felt), but it is 
also contextualised within general events (repeated events – e.g. school trips to 
museums) and lifetime periods (e.g. when I was at secondary school).  Autobiographical 
memories will typically be comprised of many, if not all, of these elements, which have 
been interlinked during the process of memory construction (Conway & Pleydell-
Pearce, 2000).  
In Conway & Pleydell-Pearce’s model (2000), episodic memories form part of the 
hierarchical structure of the autobiographical knowledge base and they are generally 
involved in the first step of memory reconstruction.  Cues constantly generate transitory 
patterns of activation across this multi-layered autobiographical knowledge base. In 
order for an autobiographical memory to be reconstructed, an episodic memory, or 
group of episodic memories, must link to a general event, and then to a lifetime period. 
Cues can result in an autobiographical memory being retrieved, either directly (it 
spontaneously ‘occurs’ to the rememberer) or through generative retrieval (it is accessed 
through a conscious search process). However not all cues will result in memory 
retrieval. Central control processes modulate these patterns of activation, preventing 
some from reaching consciousness, as they may be disruptive to current cognitive 
activity. Others are not inhibited and therefore may form a memory. Memories that are 
retrieved multiple times (rehearsal) will be accessed more readily and the future 
reconstruction of them will be faster. 
In the model of the Self-Memory System, it is the interaction of the working self and the 
autobiographical knowledge base that generates autobiographical memories (Conway 

69 
 
 
2005). The concept of the working self is understood as a combination of active goals 
and self-images, which are mental models of the self, in relation to past, present and 
future goals (Conway 2005). The notions of correspondence and coherence are central 
to this model of the self-memory system. Correspondence demands that memory should 
be consistent with experience. However, memory cannot retain records of every 
moment of experience, as this would be overwhelming and could not sustain effective 
storage and retrieval. Coherence, in contrast, requires that memories should be 
consistent with the goals and self-images of the self. A key function of the working self 
is to balance the competing demands of correspondence and coherence (Conway, 2005). 
Goals operate as control processes and they will only facilitate a memory entering into 
consciousness if it is consistent with the working self (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 
2000). As activation patterns are triggered across the autobiographical knowledge base, 
current goals of the self will moderate or inhibit further processing depending on its 
compatibility with the individual’s current self-schema. Goals may be implicit or 
explicit and research has indicated a relationship between an individual’s goals (both 
implicit and explicit) and the memories that they retrieve (Woike, Gershkovich, 
Piorkowski, & Polo, 1999).  Memories that are incongruent with a person’s current self-
schema may be repressed (in order to avoid the destabilising effect that such memories 
would have on the working self) and those that are consistent with it, in contrast, may 
be more accessible. 
In Conway & Pleydell-Pearce’s model of the Self-Memory System (2000), episodic 
memories are formed when there is a major change in goal structure, e.g. switching 
from one activity (driving to work) to another (making a cup of tea). In any day, goals, 
and changes in goals, will generate many episodic memories but only a few of these 
will remain accessible; those that are aligned with current goals and those which have 
been linked to knowledge structures in the autobiographical knowledge base. In 
summary, episodic memories provide a short-term record of progress in current goals 
processing (Conway, 2005). 
Autobiographical remembering: rehearsal and cueing: 
Memories that have been repeatedly accessed will be more easily and readily accessed 
in future recall. Rehearsal can take the form of thinking about an event later, or talking 
about it with others. The role of parents in rehearsing memories of events with their 
children has been shown to be instrumental in the ability of children to create more 

70 
 
 
richly detailed representations of events, thus indicating that the parents’ role in 
reminiscing impacts on their children’s development of autobiographical memory 
(Fivush et al., 2006). Rehearsal has also been suggested as a possible explanation for the 
clustering of memories in the reminiscence bump, due to the more frequent rehearsal of 
these memoires, which tend to be ‘first-time’ experiences (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 
2000; Conway et al., 2005). The relationship between goals, as conceived in the Self 
Memory System, and rehearsal, is also one of interdependence, as events that engage 
the working self and are consistent with its goals are more likely to be events that are 
subsequently revisited and talked about (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). 
Cues constantly generate patterns of activation across the autobiographical knowledge 
base (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). Cues may consist of different types of 
information. Imagery is known to cue autobiographical remembering (Svoboda et al., 
2006). Mental imagery is quasi-perceptual experience, which resembles perceptual 
experience but takes place without the external stimuli (Cattaneo et al., 2008; Kosslyn et 
al., 1995). It may be visual (visualizing, or ‘seeing’ with the ‘mind’s eye’) or auditory 
(such as ‘hearing’ a piece of music in one’s own mind) or tactile (imagining the feel of 
something) Richardson (1969), p3.  Episodic memories themselves are formed of highly 
detailed sensory-perceptual information, much of which is held in the form of images 
(Conway, 2001; Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). 
Upon activation, highly detailed, sensory-perceptual information may link to other 
structures in the autobiographical knowledge base, thereby generating an 
autobiographical memory. Imagery is therefore considered to play an essential role in 
facilitating the retrieval of autobiographical memories and indeed research has shown 
that imagery is a general predictor of memory specificity (Williams et al.,1999). It is 
thought that autobiographical memory retrieval draws on imagery to recall visual details 
that were encoded at the time of the event, and that these long-term visual 
representations, or images, facilitate reactivation of other information relevant to the 
event (Svoboda et al., 2006).  
Although the emphasis in autobiographical memory research has been on visual 
imagery (Brewer, 1986), imagery from other modalities is also important for 
autobiographical memory retrieval (Eardley & Pring, 2006). Imagery is generally 
accepted to be a cross-modal experience, with images experienced and reported in all 
modalities (Eardley & Pring, 2006), and research has shown that cues across visual and 

71 
 
 
nonvisual modalities can all facilitate the generation of autobiographical memories, in 
both sighted and congenitally blind people, in whom visual imagery is not possible 
(Eardley & Pring, 2006). 
Emotion also plays a key role in autobiographical remembering. Memory research 
indicates that those events that are embedded with emotion are the ones that we will 
remember most effectively. Emotional response takes on a physiological form, with the 
release of glucose and adrenal hormones into the bloodstream. Events that trigger this 
physiological response are more likely to be encoded in memory more deeply (Holland 
& Kensinger, 2010). The museum literature has reported that both positive and negative 
emotion strengthen autobiographical memory retrieval (Anderson & Shimizu, 2007). In 
psychological analysis, affective experiences can be described by a two-dimensional 
space consisting of valence, i.e. how positive or negative an emotion is) and arousal (as 
distinct from the strength of an emotion) i.e. how exciting/agitating/soothing or 
subduing. Research indicates that the level of valence of an event can impact on how 
well an autobiographical memory will later be remembered, and with what degree of 
accuracy (Holland & Kensinger, 2010).  Positive valence is generally more strongly 
associated with greater recall, a trend that might be accounted for by the fact that 
people’s self-schemas are generally positive, so positive emotions may be more likely to 
be consistent with the working self (Holland & Kensinger, 2010). 
In summary, autobiographical memories typically draw together multiple types of 
information, with emotion and imagery being particularly important for cueing 
autobiographical memories. The working self and the active goals of which it consists 
will either promote or inhibit specific memories in accordance with the rememberer’s 
current sense of self, or identity.  
Using autobiographical memory theory to evaluate impact: 
Autobiographical memories are tightly bound up with concepts of self and identity 
(Conway, 2005, Bluck, 2017, Bluck & Liao, 2013), conversation and social interactions 
(Alea & Bluck, 2003) and projected imagining and planning for the future (Bluck, 
2017). As a form of leisure activity, museum visiting may form part of our social 
interactions and our sense of who we are. For example, conversations and social 
interactions relating to museum experiences are one way in which memories of such 
experiences are rehearsed and revisited. Therefore, through social interaction and 
conversations about recent cultural experience, museums’ narratives and museum 

72 
 
 
experiences may act upon visitors’ senses of identity.  Museum research and practice 
thus recognises that museums have a role to play in various aspects of a visitor’s 
identity (Falk, 2006, 2013, 2016).  
Studying autobiographical memories of museum visits offers a unique opportunity to 
explore not only the impact of museums across the lifespan, but also the potential role 
of museums in cultural transmission and social cohesion.  Autobiographical memory is 
particularly useful to museums as it provides a broader picture of the impact of a visit, 
compared to studying semantic recall only, for example. Whilst studies of museum 
memories to date have been heavily informed by memory theory (Anderson, 2003; 
Anderson & Shimizu, 2007; Falk & Dierking, 1997; Medved et al., 2004; Medved & 
Oatley, 2000), there has not yet been a systematic exploration of memories of cultural 
events such as museum visits which is derived from the structure and content of 
autobiographical memory theory. This chapter seeks to address this gap, through 
analysis of the life-span distribution of memories for museum visits, the types of 
memories, and their content.  
Firstly, examining the lifespan distribution of autobiographical memories could provide 
important understanding about the impact of museum visits upon a visitor. For example, 
if memories for museum visits display a reminiscence bump, it could reinforce museum 
visits for school children and families as a ‘critical period’ for impact on society. It is 
also important to examine the life span distribution, as well as the types and content of 
autobiographical memories, in the context of differences between varying types of 
visitor. Museums traditionally segment their audiences based on their motivations for 
visiting, for example, explorers, facilitators, experience seekers, professional/hobbyists 
and rechargers (Falk, 2016). Whilst the underlying memory processes of these 
segmentations are unlikely to differ, there are some factors which could result in 
differences in the autobiographical memories of visitors. 
Autobiographical memory research generally suggests that older people recall more 
general memories (Levine, Svoboda, Hay, Winocur, Moscovitch, 2002) with fewer 
sensory perceptive details (Piolino, Desgranges, Benali, & Eustache, 2002; Piolino, 
Desgranges, & Eustache, 2009). Similarly, people who visit museums frequently may 
report ‘repisodes’, where many similar events converge in general memories (Cohen & 
Conway, 2007). Conversely, unusual events are often better recalled (Cohen & Conway, 
2007) and may be more vivid, meaning that infrequent visitors may have more specific 

73 
 
 
memories and memories that are richer in detail. However, as frequent visitors attend 
museums more often, they may have more specific memories as there may be simply 
more memories of visits available to be accessed. Events that are personally important, 
emotional or surprising are also likely to be better remembered (Cohen & Conway, 
2007) and when integrated with important autobiographical knowledge, the resulting 
memories may indicate moments of transition, first time or self-defining experiences.  
Understanding the content of such memories will provide museums with real insight 
about their lasting impact. Memory details such as imagery associated with the original 
perceptual experience of visiting a museum can indicate not only how vivid the memory 
is likely to be for the rememberer, but also enables the institution to assess the impact of 
the physical environment and exhibits through which they seek to tell their stories.  
Similarly, contextualising details such as time, place, or details of other people or social 
interactions can help an institution to understand how a visitor has subsequently woven 
the visit into their own narrative, for example with reference to a lifetime period 
(Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000), such as ‘when I was in a relationship with x’, or 
simply through providing the ‘back story’ of the event’s context ‘It was the first time I 
had been abroad with x’. The presence of autobiographical knowledge in such 
memories could suggest that conceptual frames are structuring the memory (Conway, 
2001, 2009) and that episodic information has been integrated with the individual’s 
knowledge about themselves.  
Semantic information pertaining to the event may be retained, and may indicate that 
some kind of ‘learning’ has taken place. Both positive and negative affect are associated 
with increased autobiographical memory recall (Yong-Chun Bahk & Kee-Hong Choi 
2017) and emotional memories have been shown to be more detailed than neutral ones 
(St Jacques & Levine, 2007). The full spectrum of emotions may be salient in the 
context of cultural institutions; an exhibition of Monet’s works could inspire awe and 
happiness, whereas an exhibition addressing the Holocaust would be more likely to 
inspire feelings of fear, anger or disgust.  
Finally, cognitions both experienced at the time and in the process of remembering 
would be indicative of the impact of the museum visit on the individual and may also 
indicate the ways in which memories for cultural events may inform the identity, social 
connection or future planning functions of memory. Emotion and cognition could 
together be considered to contribute to our understanding of visitors’ personal 

74 
 
 
reflections and reactions following a visit, and are recognised in the museum literature 
to be a useful marker for impact (Falk, 2016).  
Autobiographical memory research has developed coding systems to address the 
content of autobiographical memories and the prevalence of certain features, such as 
details of time, place, happenings, thoughts/emotions, semantic information and 
perceptual information from across modalities (Levine et al., 2002). The coding system 
used in this research combines the coding for content used by autobiographical memory 
researchers (Loveday & Conway, 2011; Levine et al., 2002) with the understanding of 
types of memories (general/specific/special) set out by Conway & Pleydell-Pearce 
(2000).  
This study addressed three research questions. The first examined whether memories for 
museum visits would follow the theoretical life-span curve. The second question 
explored the possible impact of visitor differences on memory for museum visits. 
Within this, we examined a) the impact of visit frequency on the distribution of the 
reminiscence bump; and the impact of age and visit frequency on: b) the specificity of 
autobiographical memories, and c) on the occurrence of special memories. Thirdly, we 
examined what elements make up the content of a memory for a museum visit, 
including the prevalence of certain types of memory details, and we also considered the 
richness of memories. The research explored whether the visitor characteristics of age 
and visit frequency would impact on the content or level of richness of the memories. 
Methods 
Design 
For the research question regarding the life-span distribution, an independent design 
was used, examining the specific memories for frequent and infrequent museum visitors 
(frequent or infrequent was based on frequency of visits in the last five years) across the 
life-time periods (segmented into time bins of 10 years).   
For the analysis of memory specificity, special memories and memory content, a mixed 
design was used. Within-subject variables were memory content; special memories and 
specificity. Between-group variables were visit frequency (frequent/infrequent), and age 
(young/senior). For each category, percentages were calculated of the number of 
memories/content across all memories given by individual participants.  

75 
 
 
Participants 
Forty young participants (30 years and under) and forty senior participants (40 years 
and over) were recruited via the University of Westminster’s Psychology Research 
Participation Scheme for undergraduate students, through the University of the Third 
Age, and through snowball sampling. Participants were classified into frequent and 
infrequent visitors, based on their museum visiting habits in the past five years. Using a 
median split, those who currently visited museums at least once every six months were 
classified as frequent museum visitors. Those who visited museums once a year or less 
were classified as infrequent museum visitors.  
There was no difference in the ages of the senior participants (t=.015, df=38, p=.90). 
There was a difference in the ages of the young participants, with infrequent visitors 
being significantly younger than frequent: (t=2.26, df=38, p=.03). The mean difference 
was -1.85 (95% CI: -3.5, -.19).

Table 3.1: Mean (SD) ages and genders of participant groups by age and visit frequency 
For the research question exploring life-span distribution, only participants aged 40 and 
over were included. Two participants provided only general memories and was 
excluded. Of the resulting sample of 38 participants, there were 20 frequent (mean age 
in years=58.15, SD=11.70), 18 infrequent (mean age in years= 55.39, SD=11.72)

museum visitors. A t-test confirmed no significant differences in the ages of the 
frequent and infrequent visitors: (t=0.73, df=36, p=.47).  
The study was carried out in line with British Psychological Society ethical guidelines, 
and was approved by the University of Westminster’s Psychology Ethics Committee. 
All participants gave informed consent and were debriefed upon completion. 
Materials 
Autobiographical memory questionnaire: The questionnaire invited participants to share 
up to 6 memories of museum or gallery visits. ‘Museums and galleries’ was left open 
for participants’ own interpretation and not qualified or restricted. Participants were 
instructed to just select the first 6 memories that came to mind, or as many as they were 
able to recall (if less than 6). The general probes used to develop memories were ‘please 
tell us about up to 6 museum or gallery visits that you remember…. Please just select 
the 6 that come to your mind now.’ ‘please try to describe at least three specific things 
that you remember about the experience’. Participants were then prompted to provide at 
least three specific things that they remembered about the experience, such as 
something about the museum or gallery itself, its artworks or exhibitions, a feeling they 
experienced, a conversation they had, or any specific moment they recalled about the 
visit. They were told that these things could be clear events, or just fragments of a 
memory. They were also asked to give the approximate age they were at the time of all 
visits recalled. 
Museum experience questionnaire: Participants were asked about their museum visiting 
habits, past and present, including the life period in which they visited museums most 
frequently. (please see appendix 2.1 for a copy of the questionnaire) 
Procedure 
The questionnaire was hosted on the Qualtrics platform and was distributed via an email 
link. It was completed online, meaning that participants spent variable amounts of time 
completing it and they took part in a variety of locations. Upon completion, participants 
were debriefed and thanked for their time.  

77 
 
 
Data coding 
Each individual autobiographical museum memory provided by a participant was 
categorised across two domains – specificity and importance. All memories were then 
analysed for content. 
Memory specificity and importance: 
Autobiographical memories were firstly categorised as either a non-memory, a general 
memory, or a specific memory. Specific memories only were included in analysis of the 
reminiscence bump.  
Non-memory was selected if the text given by the respondent did not constitute any kind 
of autobiographical memory, for example a generic comment such as ‘I like the Science 
Museum’, or just the name of museum itself. These were coded as non-memory and not 
analysed further. 
General memory was selected if there was no information in the memory that enabled it 
to be situated in a specific day or moment. General memories could be an amalgamation 
of many different visits, perhaps typifying a life period, or they could be descriptive 
memories without a spatial-temporal context.  
Specific memory: memories were classified as specific memories if they contained some 
detail which indicated a particular day or moment, such as a reference to the time when 
the visit happened, or to something specific that happened there.   
Grammatical tenses and their use in memory classification: The use of tenses, and 
shifts from one tense to another, were instrumental in the categorisation of memories. 
For example, the use of the present tense throughout was an indicator to classify the 
memory as ‘general’.  Similarly, some memories were all the past tense, as this 
example: ‘The V&A - I really liked that for most of the things displayed there they had 
an audio information if you are interested to hear more about what are you looking at.’ 
In cases such as these, the use of the past tense throughout could indicate two scenarios. 
Firstly, that the memory did indeed refer to a specific moment in the past. I ‘liked’ it (on 
that day that I visited). Secondly, it could indicate an opinion of a series of multiple 
visits over a period of time. As it could not be determined which scenario applied, these 
types of memories were classed as general. 

78 
 
 
Changes in tense were taken as an indicator that a memory was moving from a general 
memory to a specific moment, for example with a shift from present to past tense. In the 
following memory, the fragment contains a shift from the present tense, to the present 
perfect (‘has recreated’) to the introduction of a specific detail in the past simple tense 
(bold type): ‘Preston Park Museum, Stockton. Good place to take children as it is in a 
parkland setting. ... Museum has recreated street of shops... Also had a valuable 
painting.., housed in a darkened room by itself, very reverential, made you feel you 
could only whisper’. This shift in tense through to a specific moment in the past was 
considered adequate to classify such fragments as a ‘specific memory.’ 
Memory fragments with no verbs were by definition classed as general, as there was no 
verb construction to link detail to any specific moment: ‘Saatchi Gallery. Wonderful 
exhibition by young new artists.’ 
Special memories: Specific and general memories were coded for importance 
(special/non-special). ‘Special’ memories included memories that had an emotional 
element that indicated an enduring relevance and salience for the participant (Conway & 
Pleydell-Pearce, 2000), such as ‘first time, ‘self-defining’, ‘culture-defining’ or 
‘transitional’ memories. All other memories were categorised as ‘Non-special.’ 
Memory content: 
General and specific memories were broken down into discrete segments and scored for 
content. Participants’ counts for each category were summed and a percentage 
calculated for each type of content that they recalled.  
Scoring for content addressed categories: ‘event-specific acquired knowledge’, 
‘context’, ‘time’, ‘place’, ‘person’, ‘social interactions’, ‘event’, ‘sensory-perceptive’, 
‘emotions’ and ‘cognitions.’ A segment of text was based on units of meaning, and 
could range from a single word to an entire sentence. However, the codes were mutually 
exclusive, so once a segment was coded it was not considered for inclusion in another 
category. The texts were coded and 10% of the sample was coded by a second, 
independent rater. The second-coder was given detailed instructions, including 
examples (see appendix 2.2). Inter-rater agreement was 95.66% for the sample. 
 Event-specific acquired knowledge: this category included details internal to the event 
(visit), for example objects or artworks seen, such as ‘Queen Victoria’s wedding dress’, 

79 
 
 
‘the Mona Lisa’, and details of them, such as the ‘different expressions and postures’ of 
the Terracotta Army soldiers. This category also included physical features of the 
exhibition, its displays or facts/concepts recalled. This type of information is semantic 
information, but specific to the event being recalled. 
Context/time: This included a) abstract, thematic knowledge that contextualised other 
information in terms of the rememberer’s personal history (Conway et al., 1992). This 
category also included information from participants that was too broad in scope to 
count as a specific detail, for example: ‘there was a lot of stuff to do with the world 
war’, or comments from participants that qualified the visit in some way: ‘there was 
plenty to see and do’. It also included b) time details that place the museum visit in the 
participant’s sense of autobiographical chronology as well as details on perceived 
duration. 
Place: details of the physical environment of the museum, such as references to the 
different floors of the museum, the shop or café, or physical features such as ‘a grand 
hall’. Mention of the location (city, region). Where the participants gave a title to their 
memory, e.g. ‘the Natural History Museum’, this was not coded for place, as treating 
these as part of the memory text would have overly inflated the place counts. However, 
if specific information was given within the title ‘eg Australian Impressionists at the 
National Gallery’, then this would receive one count for ESAK’. Multiple identical 
references to the same part of the museum, e.g. ‘the rooms’ were coded for ‘place’ the 
first time, but not with every repeated use. 
Person/social interaction: This category included a) detail to do with a person or people 
known to the rememberer at subsequent recall e.g. friend or family member, teacher, or 
tour guide, and b) social interactions with others, known and unknown.  
Event: In line with other autobiographical memory coding systems (Levine et al., 2002), 
this category includes happenings ‘we lost my son’, ‘there was a book reading by an 
author’, ‘we had a guided tour’, as well as weather conditions ‘It was raining’. It also 
includes references to people present who were not known to the rememberer ‘there 
were hosts in pink shirts’, or mentions of crowding in the museum e.g. ‘it was too 
crowded to see much’. Emotional reactions or physical actions of others were coded as 
‘event’: ‘She was fit to burst with pride’, ‘I watched a man draw.’ 

80 
 
 
Sensory-perceptual (SP) categories: these categories were used to capture detail in 
memories that presented as imagery from across modalities: such as visual, auditory, 
olfactory, spatial, or taste, in accordance with the experience-near episodic elements 
described in the autobiographical memory literature (Conway, 2009; Conway & 
Pleydell-Pearce, 2000; Conway et al., 1992). Two further perceptual categories were 
defined: ‘pain’ (including discomfort and fatigue) and ‘kinaesthetic’ (including 
movement). 
Emotion: any mention of emotions experienced were coded in this category, whether 
reported directly as a feeling or state: ‘I was very emotional’, or whether reported 
indirectly: ‘wonderful exhibition’, or ‘the atmosphere was incredible.’ Reports of the 
emotions of others were included in the category ‘event,’ (Levine et al., 2002). 
Cognition: details classed as thoughts or implications were coded in this category. This 
included thoughts relating directly to the exhibit or its subject matter: ‘stunning, 
exceptionally high quality photos’, thoughts relating to the overall experience: ‘I 
remember thinking about how grand it all looked’, thoughts generated in response to the 
event (visit): ‘For the first time in my life, I had mixed feeling towards my faith’ and 
thoughts relating to the rememberer themselves and their autobiographical memories: 
‘reminded me of flying my kite with my dad.’ Cognition also included expressions of 
interest. Cognitions were not coded for the content within them, to avoid double coding 
the texts. 
Results 
Life-span distribution 
A total of 210 memories were provided by 40 participants aged 40 and over. General 
memories were excluded, leaving a sample of 128 specific memories from 38 
participants. These memories were sorted into 10-year bins, and the age at encoding was 
plotted against the numbers of memories observed and the number of memories that 
would be expected. The expected value was determined by evenly distributing the 
number of memories provided by the participant across their life span, for example a 
40-year-old who provided two memories would have an expected value of 0.5 in the 
first four time bins (Loveday, Woy, & Conway, in prep.), see Figure 3.1: 

81 
 
 
 
Figure 3.1: Distribution of specific memories across the life span; expected and observed data 
A chi-square analysis confirmed that the patterns of expected and observed data were 
significantly different: chi-sq=103.00, df=7, n=38 p<.001. Figure 3.1 suggests that, 
although relatively more memories were encoded in one of the reminiscence bump 
decades of 10-19, fewer memories in the first four decades of life were encoded than 
may be expected. In contrast, more memories were encoded than expected from the 40-
49 decade and upwards, indicating a strong recency effect for the sample (where the 
mean age was 56.84 years). 
Data were collected to examine the life period in which people visited museums most 
frequently. As demonstrated by Figure 3.2, the strong recency effect observed above 
does not appear to reflect the periods in people’s lives when they were visiting 
museums the most.

Visitor differences 
Reminiscence bump 
The life-span distribution data was split by frequent and infrequent visitor groups. This 
resulted in a total sample of 18 memories for frequent visitors and 33 for infrequent 
visitors. Only memories encoded before age 40 were examined, as this represented the 
period within which all participants could generate memories. This is standardly the 
period considered to represent the reminiscence bump. All memories within five years 
of the participants’ ages were excluded. 

83 
 
 
 
Figure 3.3: Percentage of memories up to age 40 by age at encoding, split by visit frequency, 
with five-year recency removed 
The pattern of encoding in Figure 3.3 suggests an earlier peak for frequent compared to 
infrequent visitors. This is despite the fact that the median ages of encoding for the first 
museum memories was comparable in both groups. The median age of encoding for the 
first museum memory was 8 years (range =24) for frequent visitors and 8.75 years 
(range =45) for infrequent visitors. A Mann-Whitney U test confirmed no difference 
between these two groups: (U=574.00, N1=36, N2=36, p=.406).  
Memory specificity 
Memory specificity, special memories and the content of memories was analysed to 
establish the effects of age and visit frequency. Firstly, the number of memories 
provided by each group was calculated:

Table 3.2: Mean (SD) number of memories provided, by participant group 
The mean number of memories for both frequent and infrequent older adults, and the 
frequent younger visitors was close to ceiling of 6 memories (see Table 3.2). The 
younger, infrequent visitors appeared to have fewer memories, on average, than the 
other three groups. However, a Mann-Whitney U test confirmed no difference in the 
number of memories between young infrequent and frequent museum visitors: (U 
=139.00, N1 = 20, N2 = 20, p =.076.), suggesting no differences between groups overall 
for the number of memories produced. 
From the 420 memories generated by participants, 3 were non memories. These were 
excluded from the data and not considered further. The percentage of each participant’s 
memories that were specific and general were calculated and these values used to 
calculate the mean for each participant group. 

85 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.4: mean (SD) percentages of specific and general memories by participant groups  
Figure 3.4 shows that general memories appear more prevalent in the older participant 
groups. As the normality of the data distribution did not permit use of ANOVA, a 
Mann-Whitney U test was performed on the proportion of participants’ memories that 
were specific: (U =421.00, N1 = 40, N2 = 40, p < 0.001). This showed that the 
proportion of specific memories was significantly higher for younger participants 
(median=1, range=1) than older participants (median =.67, range=1). However, there 
was no significant difference between frequent and infrequent visitors (U=766.50, N1 = 
40, N2 = 40, p=.74). 
Special memories 
Transitional, self-defining and ‘first-time’ museum memories were rare, with no 
culture-defining memories within the sample. All these memories were combined into 
one ‘special memories’ category. Although the mean percentage of special memories 
was slightly higher for senior infrequent visitors (mean= 8.75%, SD= 16.99) compared 
to all other groups (all means ≤ 4.58%, s.d. ≤ 9.92), the numbers were extremely low, 
and too low for further analysis.  
Memory details 
A total of 417 memories provided by the 80 participants were coded for content, and 
percentages recorded for content types for each participant. Mean percentages of the 

86 
 
 
total number of details were then calculated for the participants for each detail type and 
are shown in Figure 3.5.  
 
Figure 3.5: Mean (SD) percentage values for content categories 
The data distributions of the finalised 8 content categories was rendered suitable for 
parametric analysis by means of a square root transformation. Where sphericity could 
not be assumed, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. A mixed ANOVA (2 x 
2 x 8) was performed on the mean percentages of content types. The between subject 
factors were age (young/senior) and visit frequency (frequent/infrequent). The within 
subjects variable was content type (ESAK/context-time/emotion/cognition/ sensory-
perceptive/event/place/person-social). There was no significant main effect of age (F (1, 
76) =0.58, p=.45) or visit frequency (F (1, 76)=0.54, p=.47), There was a significant 
main effect of content categories: (F (5.6, 427.12)=13.23, p<.001). There was also a 
significant interaction between age and content types: (F (5.6, 427.12)=.3.12, p=.006). 
There were no other significant interactions (all p>.1).  
From Figure 3.5, event-specific acquired knowledge (ESAK) appears to be the most 
prevalent type of content, followed by context-time. Repeated measures contrasts were 
conducted on the square root transformed variables to examine the main effect of 
content category. These indicated that there was a significant difference between ESAK 
and Context-time (p=.006). The mean difference was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.21, 1.24). There 
was a significant difference between Context-time and Emotion (p=.033). The mean 
difference was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.95). There was no difference between Emotion 

87 
 
 
and Cognition; Cognition and Sensory-perceptive; Sensory-perceptive and Event (all 
p>.66). More Events were recalled than Place (p=.033), mean difference 0.45, (95% CI: 
0.04, 0.87) but there was no difference between Place and Person/Social Interaction 
(p=.62).  
It is worth noting that when emotion and cognition were combined into a ‘reactions’ 
category, then the mean (SD) value for this category was 24.46 (14.67). A t test 
confirmed no difference between ESAK and reactions: (t (79) =.63, p=.53). 
In order to explore the interaction between age and category type, t-tests on the square 
root transformed variables of the 8 detail types were performed, with age as a grouping 
variable. Bonferroni-holm corrections were applied for multiple tests. There was a 
significant difference between age groups for emotion: (t (73.64) =2.04, p=.045), with a 
mean difference of -0.67 between transformed emotion scores for young and senior 
(95% CI: -1.22, -0.02). For event, there was a significant difference between groups: (t 
(78) =4.12, p<.001), with a mean difference of 1.12 between transformed event scores 
for young and senior (95% CI: 0.59, 1.65). No other t-tests were significant, all p ≥.22.

A 2 (young/senior) x 2 (frequent/infrequent) between subjects ANOVA looking at 
participant’s mean memory word count confirmed that there were no significant effects 
of age (F (1,76) = 1.34, p=.25) or visit frequency (F (1,76) =.67, p=.42) and no 
interaction effect (F (1,76) =.54, p=.46).  
In order to compare the richness of memories for each participant the total number of 
details was divided by the number of memories to get the mean number of details. The 
resulting data were rendered suitable for parametric analysis by means of a square root 
transformation. An ANOVA was performed on the mean details provided. There was no 
main effect of age (young, senior) on the mean details provided: (F (1,76) =0.002, 
p=.97), and no main effect of visit frequency (frequent, infrequent) on the mean details 
provided. (F (1,76) =0.160, p=.69). There was no significant interaction (F (1,76) =.46, 
p=.50). 
Discussion 
This study explored autobiographical memories for museum visits throughout the life-
span. The study sought to establish what the impact of visit frequency might be on the 
life-span distribution of these memories, and what the impact of visit frequency and age 
might be on their specificity, ‘special’ nature and content.  
The first research question addressed the life span distribution for specific memories of 
museum visits. For the sample as a whole, the distribution of memories differed 
significantly from the expected distribution. Whilst the whole group sample suggests a 
small reminiscence bump in the teenage years, what is most striking about this data is 
the strength of recency effect. This pattern differs from other explorations of the 
distribution of lifespan memories (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000, Munawar, Kuhn & 
Haque, 2018). The current study suggests that autobiographical recall of museum visits 
is biased towards recent experiences rather than the earlier identify-forming years. In 
other words, memories of museum visiting do not tend to be ‘stand-out’ memories that 
are hugely important in terms of identity development during the reminiscence bump 
period. 
It is possible that the observed recency effect may reflect the importance of social 
sharing. Museum-going is an activity or interest, often carried out in a social group, 
which may provide content for social interaction and interpersonal communication 
(Alea & Bluck, 2003, Cohen & Conway, 2007). As such, it is part of social sharing, 

89 
 
 
which has also been closely linked to identity (Pasupathi, 2001). This finding is also 
important from the museum perspective, because it suggests that museum visits not only 
provide opportunity for social sharing and interaction during the visit (Falk, 2016), but 
also the memory of that visit forms part of interpersonal communication which may 
have links to identity. This type of sharing of experiences or interests with others may 
be what keep recent memories accessible (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000).  
Furthermore, if one is a keen museum-goer, and this forms part of one’s current 
identity, then memories of museum visits may be privileged by the memory system. 
This would be in accordance with the theoretical understanding of the relationship 
between the current self and working goals (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000, Conway, 
Singer & Tagini, 2004). It is therefore possible that the recency effect observed here is 
indicative of museums continuing to feed into visitors’ sense of identity throughout life, 
which would support the importance of the relationship between museums and identity 
as explored in the museum literature (e.g. Falk, 2016). An alternative explanation for 
the recency effect is that people are more likely to go to museums when older, and so 
have more recent accessible memories in these later decades. For example, research has 
indicated that 41% of all visitors are over the age of 55 (The Audience Agency, 2018). 
However, in our sample, participants self-reported as visiting museums most frequently 
earlier in life. 
The second research question addressed the question of the impact of visit frequency 
and age on autobiographical memory for museum visits. An exploration of the 
distribution of memories across the lifespan suggested that frequent visitors had a 
higher proportion of memories in early childhood, despite the fact that there was no 
difference between frequent and infrequent visitors in terms of the age of the first 
museum memory. Whilst it is not clear if the frequent visitors had more visits during 
early years, if the visits were simply more memorable, or whether it is a combination of 
both; it is worth noting that this finding is consistent with research that shows an earlier 
reminiscence bump for music in musicians compared with non-musicians (Loveday, 
2016). It is also worth noting that while there appears to be a reminiscence bump, the 
overall frequency of observed memories was lower than the expected distribution of 
memories within that period. Nevertheless, these findings are in line with observations 
from the museum literature, which have identified the importance of museum visiting in 
childhood as a grounding for future museum visiting habits in later life (Falk, 2016). 
Our results are also in line with previous research that has demonstrated that older 

90 
 
 
individuals produced more general memories than younger people (Dikmen et al, 2014, 
Levine et al., 2002, Piolino et al., 2009). No differences were found between memory 
specificity between frequent and infrequent visitors.  
The third research question concerned the content of autobiographical memories for 
museum visits, with a consideration of the possible impact of age or visit frequency. 
Our coding model was designed to distinguish between different types of content within 
both general and specific autobiographical memories. The pattern of content of museum 
memories was similar across all participants, with only minor differences relating to age 
or museum visiting habits.  
The results for content showed a hierarchy of content categories in the memories across 
the sample. These content categories can be understood as the ‘building blocks’ that 
contribute to the reconstruction of a memory of a cultural experience, and to the re-
telling of that memory. When participants’ emotional and cognitive reactions to the 
museum visit were combined into ‘personal reactions’ (see Levine et al., 2002), the 
most prevalent categories were the latter and event-specific-acquired knowledge –what 
was seen and learnt in the museum environment. 
The next largest category was context-time. Much of this information encompassed 
participants’ ‘back story’ to the event they were describing. The prevalence of this 
category is consistent with the understanding of autobiographical memory’s importance 
in social functions, including social sharing and telling one’s own story (Cohen & 
Conway, 2007). Thus, participants ‘told the story’ of their memories of museum visits, 
as demonstrated across the sample: ‘I’m from Hastings and we have several museums 
as we are a historic town’ (young, frequent visitor); ‘This was the first museum I visited 
when I came to London’ (young, infrequent visitor). The importance of context or 
‘back-story’ also suggests that a memory of a museum visit is integrated with 
hierarchies of information that are personal to the rememberer, such as ‘when I went on 
school trips’, or ‘when I was in a relationship with x.’ Furthermore, it seems likely that 
memories of events (i.e. visits and events within them) are also contextualised by 
conceptual knowledge, such as ‘I remember this day really well because as a child I was 
really interested in astronomy.’ This category is therefore consistent with the 
contextualised and thematic nature of autobiographical memories (Conway & Pleydell-
Pearce, 2000). 

91 
 
 
These findings show that the detail of what was seen or learnt, personal reactions, 
followed by the context of the museum visit, were the most important categories in 
these memories. This indicates both that some form of ‘learning’ took place in the 
museum, that cognitive and emotional reactions took place, and that visitors 
contextualised their memory of the visit within their autobiographical knowledge about 
themselves. The tendency to contextualise is also indicative of the social sharing 
function of autobiographical memory, as it forms a key explanatory part of narrative. 
That emotion should be salient is unsurprising, given that emotion is frequently 
expressed in the retelling of events (Alea, Bluck,& Semegon, 2004). Events that trigger 
emotional responses are more likely to be encoded in memory more deeply (Holland & 
Kensinger, 2010) and both positive and negative emotion have been shown to 
strengthen autobiographical memory retrieval in the museum literature (Anderson & 
Shimizu, 2007, Falk, 2016). Furthermore, emotional memories have been shown to be 
richer in detail (St Jacques & Levine, 2007). Thought-provoking museum visits are 
likely to involve encounters with unusual or unfamiliar content, or with content that 
forms some kind of connection to the visitor’s personal experience. It therefore seems 
likely that such encounters may stand to be discussed (rehearsed) more often, thus 
rendering these cognitive details more accessible later when the event of the visit is 
reconstructed. Higher levels of both emotional and cognitive content arguably infer that 
a deeper level of processing has taken place. The salience of emotional and cognitive 
reflections is consistent with the discussion of meaning-making in the museum literature 
which describes how visitors reconstruct memories of their visit from the array of 
thoughts, emotions and visiting contexts (Falk, 2016). 
The next levels of the hierarchy all had a relatively small level of content. Sensory 
perceptive detail and event were followed by place and social interaction. Museum 
researchers contend that social interactions are a strong influence in the visitor 
experience (Ellenbogen, Luke & Dierking, 2007, Falk & Dierking, 2000, Falk, 2016). 
Therefore, it seems surprising that content about people and social interactions should 
be at the lowest end of the hierarchy. Following Levine et al (2002), we analysed social 
interaction with known individuals separately from observations or interactions with 
people not known to the participant (classed within event). It is possible that combining 
all references to other people into a broader ‘people’ category may have resulted in a 
larger overall category. Further research on the nature of memories for experiences, 

92 
 
 
particularly cultural experiences, is needed to contextualise this finding, and provide a 
benchmark for the importance of social interactions in memories for experiences. 
Just as the detail categories were broadly consistent across participant groups, so too 
was the level of richness of the memories, in other words, the total number of details 
recalled. Although older people had more general memories than younger people, the 
prevalence of general memories did not impact on memory richness. Inclusion of details 
that are not necessarily linked to a sense of re-experiencing through memory specificity 
may account for this.  
There were some differences as a result of age and visit frequency. Analysis confirmed 
a higher proportion of emotional content in older participants, and higher proportion of 
event content in younger participants. It is possible that the higher proportion of 
emotional content recalled by older adults could be due to the relationship between 
emotion and autobiographical remembering, that is, that museum visits that evoked 
more emotion were more likely to endure across the life span (Holland & Kensinger, 
2010). However, increased emotional content could also be due to changing 
relationships with emotion in aging. Research has suggested that older adults process 
and retain emotional material more deeply than younger adults (Carstensen & Turk-
Charles, 1994), and that older adults recall more thoughts and feelings than younger 
adults (Luchetti & Sutin, 2017, Hashtroudi, Johnson, & Chrosniak, 1990). 
In contrast, details of event content were more prevalent in younger visitors. These 
details made up the experience of the day, such as participation in activities, playing 
games and interacting with displays, making purchases in the shop, taking photos, or 
recalling details about other visitors in the environment. Such content, when present, 
enriches memory specificity. It is likely that the event content in our results was an 
aspect of specificity which contributed to the higher proportion of memories being 
coded as specific in the younger participants. This finding is consistent with the 
research literature that has demonstrated higher levels of specificity in younger adults 
and more general memories in older adults (Dikmen et al, 2014, Levine et al., 2002, 
Piolino et al., 2009). Therefore, the findings for emotion and event in this research are 
consistent with what is known about autobiographical memory and ageing. This 
suggests that the pattern of content of memories was predominately similar for all 
visitors, regardless of age and visit frequency. 

93 
 
 
Conclusions 
The exploration of the distribution of memories for museum visits across the lifespan 
highlighted the importance of recency in the lifespan distribution of museum memories. 
This finding is suggestive of the importance of museum visits to the social sharing 
function of autobiographical memory. If one partakes in cultural activities in the form of 
leisure activities, interests and hobbies, then it seems likely that the memories of these 
activities will form part of the current sense of self and one’s social conversations, 
thereby promoting the accessibility of these memories through coherence and rehearsal. 
It is also likely that early positive experience in museums impacts on visit frequency 
later in life, reinforcing the importance of time invested in programming with children 
and young people. 
The results also demonstrated that all visitors presented similar patterns of recall in 
terms of content, with the exception of variations in specificity and in emotion content 
which are consistent with the literature on autobiographical memory and ageing. This 
suggests that the content of museums memories as it endures over time is less subject to 
individual differences in the museum visiting experience, but is rather structured by the 
hierarchical nature of autobiographical memory and the effects of ageing. This finding 
adds weight to observations in the museum literature that museum memories share 
structural commonalities and that all memories are constructed from a small number of 
basic elements (Falk, 2016). For museums, this suggests that visitor demographics may 
not be the key metric in understanding impact, as all visitors present similar patterns of 
content in recollections. Rather, museums could more usefully consider the types of 
content recalled, and what this may mean for the impact that they have and the way that 
they engage. 
Key features of autobiographical remembering were demonstrated in this research; the 
presence of knowledge acquired during the event, contextualising details that suggest 
the integration of such information with higher order conceptual frameworks, affect, 
and more limited episodic information such as experience-near sensory perceptive 
elements. This research also demonstrates that museum memories are embedded with 
thoughts and emotions that endure strongly enough over time to present in a remote 
recall task that was not heavily prompted or directed. For museums, this suggests that 
finding ways to help visitors relate ‘learning’ to their own experiences and sense of self 
stands to create enduring memories. Understanding how a visit might become part of a 

94 
 
 
visitor’s personal narrative in years to come is crucial, and programming and 
interpretation that invites the visitor to embed the visit into their own personal narrative 
may help to develop the potential for long-lasting memories. Visitors’ memories show 
that they integrate the visit into their own personal history, their sense of who they are, 
and that their reactions (thoughts, emotions) to the visit are what endure. The 
application of understanding from autobiographical memory theory will only serve to 
enrich our understanding of memories for cultural events and their function in human 
memory. 
Summary  
Evaluation measures drawn from autobiographical memory theory are able to provide 
generalisable understanding about museums’ impact on their visitors. This analysis 
based on autobiographical memory measures suggests a number of ways in which 
museums impact on their visitors over the life span. The strong recency effect suggests 
the importance of inter-personal communication and social sharing in autobiographical 
memories for recent cultural experiences. The importance of early experiences in 
museums is also suggested by the findings with frequent museum visitors. The analysis 
on content provides understanding about the lasting impact of a museum visit. It reveals 
a lasting impact of information encountered in the museum, the ways in which visitors 
contextualise the museum experience in their own personal narratives, and the salience 
of personal reflections about the experience. The hierarchy of content recalled is 
primarily the same across visitor differences, with the variations that are observed being 
attributable to what is known about autobiographical memory and ageing. The coding 
model used here thereby enables exploration of the long-term impact of museum 
experiences. This brings context to the discipline of museum AD by setting out the 
salient features of the experience that AD is seeking to facilitate. Having looked in 
depth firstly at museum AD practices and AD’s function as access, and secondly at the 
museum experience in the form of memories, this thesis will now turn to an exploration 
of the impact of AD on the experience and memorability of sighted people.

Chapter 4:  ‘Guided looking’: supporting visual 
exploration of artworks with audio description 
 
Abstract 
This chapter explores the impact of museum AD on the experience and engagement of 
sighted people. It is the first empirical study to do so. The chapter briefly revisits the 
rationale for exploring the use of AD by sighted visitors in the context of access, 
inclusion and inclusive design, before expanding upon the ways in which ‘experience’ 
and ‘engagement’ can be understood and measured. In this study, sighted participants 
viewed a photography exhibition, either with a standard audio guide (SAG) an audio 
descriptive guide (ADG), or no audio interpretation. Their experience of the exhibition 
was measured at the first stage of the experiment (time A) and one month later (time B). 
At time B, participants were also asked to recall as much detail about the photos as 
possible. The findings showed that the experience of viewing the photos was broadly 
similar for participants regardless of whether or not they listened to SAG, an ADG, or 
nothing at all, although subsequent engagement (activity related to the experience that 
took place in the month after viewing) was higher in those who listened to audio texts. 
SAG and ADG participants recalled more photos than NA participants, but 
memorability was richest for participants who listened to AD, indicating that AD 
increases the lasting impact of the artworks presented. An ADG therefore has potential 
as a tool for inclusive interpretation in museums, as it is enjoyed as much as standard 
audio guides, and it results in more detail being recalled about the artworks. It could 
also be used by people with or without sight, reducing the need for separate access 
resources and segregation of visitor groups.

Introduction  
The central concept of this thesis is that ‘access’ in the museum means not only physical 
access to collections, but access to an engaging experience, with elements of emotional, 
social, and cognitive engagement. This distinction is of fundamental importance to 
museum AD, as it has implications for the content of AD, what it seeks to address, and 
the level of interpretation that may be permissible (see Chapter 2). If ‘access’ is 
restricted to the concept of physical access to collections, then AD would logically 
describe only the physical details of an object or artwork. However, museum memories 
demonstrate that whilst the content of what is seen and ‘learnt’ in the museum is 
important, so are personal contexts, thoughts, and feelings, traces of which can endure 
even after many years (Chapter 3). The findings of the thesis thus far suggest that a 
broader understanding of the remit of AD could be more consistent with facilitating 
experiences that are emotionally and cognitively stimulating as well as providing 
essential access to visual information for people unable to perceive it for themselves. 
This suggests a need to evaluate and understand the full breadth of AD facilitated 
experiences, including their cognitive, emotional and social elements. Furthermore, 
whilst there is a clear need for AD to facilitate museum experiences for people who are 
blind and partially sighted, there has been little exploration of the use of AD by sighted 
people. This chapter will now go on to consider what impact AD may have on this 
population’s level of access to museums’ collections. 
Barriers to access and AD as inclusive design 
It is important to re-visit the reasons why the use of museum AD by sighted people 
should be explored. Findings in the research literature on the museum experience 
suggest that having sight does not necessarily equate to having access in the museum 
(Koide et al., 2015). There may be a number of barriers to access. Firstly, the visual 
environment of the museum can be overwhelming (Bitgood, 2013), with an array of 
visual stimuli competing for visitors’ attention. This may lead to ‘browsing’ behaviour, 
whereby visitors spend only seconds in front of each exhibit viewed, moving swiftly 
from one to another, with limited time spent in front of any one piece. This has been 
demonstrated through studies of visitors’ behaviour in art museums. Smith & Smith 
(2001) observed 150 visitors in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, finding that visitors 
spent a median time of 17 seconds viewing a single artwork. In 2017, this study was 
replicated in the Art Institute Chicago (Smith et al., 2017) with observations of 456 

97 
 
 
visitors, recording a median time of 21 seconds. These studies raise the question of how 
much meaningful engagement can take place in such a short time.  
A second potential barrier consists of the variation in people’s knowledge about art and 
objects, and how to explore them visually. Research comparing viewing patterns of 
visitors who are art experts and non-experts has shown that although visitors with sight 
can see a work of art, they may not know how to use that vision to look in ways that 
draw out its specific cultural or artistic significance, context, or meanings (Koide et al., 
2015; Vogt & Magnussen, 2007) . This means that whilst novice museum visitors can 
see, they may not know to what they should pay attention in order to create a 
memorable or engaging experience (Csikszentmihalyi & Robinson, 1990). For example, 
art experts may scan for composition and form, whereas visitors with little knowledge 
of art are more likely to be drawn to recognisable features (Koide et al, 2015). This 
research suggests that visitors’ ability to undertake a visual exploration of a stimulus is 
variable according to experience. It then follows that visitors may benefit from 
information on where to direct their visual attention, and knowing how and where to 
look, in order to enrich cognitive and emotional stimulation. 
Some museums are responding to these barriers by seeking to control visual access by 
encouraging visitors to slow the pace of their looking and to be more selective in the 
number of objects they choose to look at. The curator of Tate Modern’s 2018 Pierre 
Bonnard exhibition, Matthew Gale, has been reported as suggesting that visitors might 
look closely at just two or three works, allowing them to see things that they might 
otherwise miss (Brown, 2018), and increasing attention is being paid to ‘slow-looking’ 
both in the research literature and the media (Roberson, 2011; Rosenbloom, 2014; 
Tishman, 2017) . However, such slow-looking workshops are currently a minority 
rather than a mainstream offering.  
The majority of the support that museums offer visitors in terms of helping them to 
engage comes from more traditional museum interpretation, in the form of text labels 
and panels. In order for visitors to have an engaging experience, this interpretation has 
to capture visitors’ attention and then hold it (Bitgood, 2013, in the hope that in so 
doing, their attention will be focused long enough for interest to be triggered (Renninger 
& Hidi, 2011, 2015; see Chapter 1). The busy and visually complex environment of 
many museums may pose a challenge to this capture of attention and development of 
interest. Furthermore, interpretation such as text labels and panels still require visitors to 

98 
 
 
combine their reading of these with a visual exploration of a work of art, meaning that 
engagement is still likely to be contingent on both the initial focusing of attention and 
the ability to explore artworks visually. Museum interpretation may be missing out on 
the opportunity to fully engage the visitor, if it assumes that sighted visitors have the 
visual literacy needed to direct their attention, in order to access what they are seeing 
(Eardley et al., 2017). It has been recognised that interpretation can support the visitor 
in recognising significance and deriving meaning from an experience, and that without 
this support, fulfilment is likely to be low (Bauer-Kroesbacher, 2013). 
Interpretation that is delivered via the auditory channel, in the form of traditional audio 
guides, may help to support the reading of an image, and guides are therefore regarded 
as ‘anchoring’ texts in the museum (Christensen, 2011). Audio guides are known to 
impact on visitors by encouraging them to attend differently in the museum; prolonging 
their time spent at exhibits (Bauer-Kroesbacher, 2013), increasing inquisitive 
behaviours (Sung et al., 2008) and increasing engagement (Bertens & Polak, 2019). The 
use of a guide can therefore provide a way to navigate the myriad of visual stimuli on 
offer in the museum and to engage more deeply and cohesively with chosen exhibits.  
Psychological theories of levels of processing (Craik, 2002; Craik & Lockhart, 1972; 
Ekuni, Vaz, & Bueno, 2011) may help to explain some of the benefits of audio guides to 
visitors. Firstly, levels of processing theory suggests that processing of a stimulus can 
occur at different levels, ranging from ‘shallow’ processing, which is based on the 
perceptual experience (colour, form, brightness, loudness etc) to ‘deep’ processing, 
whereby the stimulus incites personal analysis of meaning, inference and implications 
(Craik, 2002). Deeper processing is associated with increased memorability of the 
stimulus, both in working memory and autobiographical memory (Ekuni et al., 2011). 
In psychology, levels of processing and the relationship with memory are explored 
through tasks which require participants to recall words originally presented in different 
ways, ranging from the ‘shallow’ perceptual presentation (e.g. the word presented in 
different font colours) to ‘deep’ presentation (e.g. asking participants to engage with the 
semantic meaning of the word, by asking them to determine whether it fits in a certain 
sentence) (Ekuni et al., 2011).  
In the museum context, these investigations may imply potentially different outcomes in 
terms of memorability depending on the original presentation of the stimulus (the 
artwork or exhibit). Perceptual presentation only (visual exploration) may result in 

99 
 
 
‘shallower’ processing than semantic or ‘deeper’ processing, where interpretation is 
provided that enables the user to interweave information about the stimulus with their 
existing knowledge. In the context of a museum, the deepest levels of cognitive 
engagement may be stimulated by the information or ‘story’ that could be provided by 
an audio guide. Furthermore, the provision of information through a guide can help 
users to make connections between the information they hear, and their existing 
networks and hierarchies of knowledge, a process known as elaboration (Craik, 2002). 
The provision of audio interpretation, therefore, may impact on memorability through 
helping to achieve a deeper level of processing and a greater degree of elaboration. 
Memorability benefits have been claimed by providers (Hinz, 2019), and have been the 
subject of theoretical exploration (Bertens & Polak, 2019) , although such benefits have 
not yet been tested in empirical research.  
However, despite the potential benefits to attention and engagement, the uptake of audio 
guides in museums is generally regarded as low (Lee, 2017). One audio guide study 
reported that 1 in 5 (of 40 participants) used audio guides ‘often’ but 65% of the group 
said they use them ‘rarely’ (Bertens & Polak, 2019). Another study on the uptake of 
audio guides in palaces in France and South Korea found that the use of guides was 5% 
and 1% respectively (Lee, 2017).  In the UK, it has been reported that guides are used 
by 3% of visitors in the British Museum, despite significant investment and provision 
(Mannion, Shelley, Sabiescu, Amalia, Robinson, 2015).  
Proposed reasons for this low uptake include practical issues such as not knowing they 
are available, or whether or not they are included in the ticket price, or not wanting to 
queue for one (Bauer-Kroesbacher, 2013; Lee, 2017). In Bauer-Kroesbacher’s (2013) 
investigation, 1 in 5 participants said that guides take too long, and indeed Lee (2017) 
found that only 27% of visitors used the guide until the end of the tour. Other criticisms 
have been raised regarding audio guides and their isolating effect (Aoki et al., 2002; 
Bauer-Kroesbacher, 2013; Lee, 2017) and it has been suggested that they hamper the 
visitor’s ability to enjoy the exhibits with full independence of thought (Bauer-
Krösbacher, 2013) (see also Chapter 1).  Audio guides have also been criticised for 
being too detailed or distracting (Bauer-Kroesbacher, 2013). Therefore, the potential 
benefits of the audio guides to engagement and memorability have to be contextualized 
with the current low uptake that seems to pervade, and the disadvantages suggested in 
the research literature. 

100 
 
 
There are, however, compelling reasons why AD may differ to traditional audio guides 
and why it may potentially have a greater impact on memorability. A key difference 
between traditional guides and AD is that the purpose of traditional guides, whilst 
drawing attention to salient visual features, is not to systematically direct visual 
attention. Their role is rather to provide background information and context. AD, in 
contrast, would offer a kind of ‘guided looking’ for sighted people (Eardley et al., 
2017), due to its anticipated ability to help people to direct, and importantly, prolong 
their visual attention. This difference between the two provisions has been demonstrated 
in AVT research, where corpus analyses have been undertaken on audio description and 
audio guide texts. Findings have demonstrated that spatial and visual positioning words 
were prevalent in AD texts, but not to the same extent in audio guide texts (Jiménez 
Hurtado & Soler Gallego, 2015), indicating the lower incidence, or absence, of ‘guided 
looking’ in traditional audio guides.  
The use of the traditional audio guide is therefore likely to consist of two separate and 
simultaneous activities, exploring an artwork or object visually whilst listening to 
relevant information. It is therefore possible that audio guides could divide attention and 
increase cognitive load by requiring the visitor to attend to competing visual and 
auditory information. In contrast, AD would provide congruent visual and auditory 
stimuli to sighted people, as the nature of audio description would mean that users’ eyes 
would be guided to a visual feature by way of the verbal explanation, which is delivered 
aurally. This may reduce cognitive load, and indeed enhance memorability, as 
congruent stimuli are known to increase later recall (Kim et al., 2008). Indeed, 
psychologists advising museum practice have emphasised the importance of semantic 
congruence in museum interpretation (Ward, 2014).  
There are other features of AD which suggest it could stimulate engagement levels even 
above and beyond those of traditional guides. Firstly, AD has the potential to create a 
multisensory experience through its use of sensory imagery, which would stand to 
increase memorability in sighted and blind people alike (Eardley & Pring, 2006). 
Secondly, it could provoke emotional and cognitive responses not only through the 
information it presents, but also its use of cognitive prompts and narrative (see Chapter 
2 for discussion of these techniques). Creating a story is known to help recall of content 
(Bellezza, Richards, & Geiselman, 1976), as this is thought to help to organise ideas 
during encoding (Craik, 2002).  In short, the techniques inherent to AD and its potential 

101 
 
 
effect on sighted visitor attention might impact positively on the nature and level of 
engagement for sighted visitors, and the resulting memorability of the experience.  
Investigations into the use of AD with sighted people are limited, but research in film 
suggests attention benefits, with an eye-tracking study with children demonstrating that 
the use of AD led to more fixations in the areas of interest (Krejtz, Szarkowska, Krejtz, 
Walczak, & Duchowski, 2012). Museum AD practitioners also report that AD can 
benefit sighted people in a museum (RNIB, 2010; Synder, 2014), leading practitioners 
and researchers to speculate that it has potential as inclusive interpretation for all 
visitors (Eardley et al., 2017; Neves, 2016; RNIB, 2010). Inclusive Design principles 
seek to ensure not only that experiences are accessible to the widest possible group of 
people, but also that they are enriching and satisfying (MW2016, 2016). The creation of 
museum interpretation which could benefit more than one group of visitors would be in 
line with such principles, as well as furthering museums’ desire to be inclusive 
organisations (Sandell, 2003). Furthermore, if museums were to provide audio guides 
that were fully inclusive for both blind and sighted visitors, then this would help to 
avoid the current situation whereby blind visitors have to use separate resources, 
resulting in a sense of segregation from other visitors (Reich et al., 2011). 
However, the drawbacks of traditional audio guides such as isolation from companions, 
loss of independence of thought, distraction or unnecessary levels of detail (Aoki et al., 
2002; Bauer-Kroesbacher, 2013; Bertens & Polak, 2019; Lee, 2017; Woodruff et al., 
2001) could also apply to AD. There is therefore a need to explore the impact of 
museum AD on experience and engagement, a question not yet addressed in the 
research literature. There is also no data on how AD is received by sighted users in 
museums. The findings of this thesis so far have suggested that the potential benefits of 
AD should be analysed and considered in the context of a broad understanding of 
experience and engagement, as museum visits have been demonstrated to leave multiple 
traces of experience including emotional and cognitive aspects (Chapter 3). 
Furthermore, an understanding of access should incorporate social, emotional and 
cognitive engagement as well as physical access, meaning that analysis of museum AD 
as Inclusive Design should allow for identification and measurement of all of these 
elements.  

102 
 
 
Engaging experiences: approaches to measurement 
Museum research and practice have sought to facilitate and measure engagement (Herz, 
2017; Taheri et al., 2014). However, engagement is in itself a complex term that resists 
straightforward definitions: various aspects of engagement may need to be measured in 
different ways (See Chapter 1). Firstly, having an engaging experience in a museum 
consists of cognitive, emotional and social aspects, as demonstrated in Chapter 3 (see 
also: Anderson, 2003; Anderson & Shimizu, 2007; Falk & Dierking, 1990, 1997; 
Medved et al., 2004). Cognitive aspects may consist of the assimilation of semantic 
information, such as socio-historical narrative or concepts learnt in the museum. It 
could also include people’s expressions of interest. Furthermore, engagement in the 
museum is not purely cognitive but could also mean having an enjoyable or moving 
experience, which suggests the importance of understanding visitors’ emotional 
responses to museum experiences. Understanding the nature of social interactions can 
provide further insight into how engaging the experience was for the visitor. Therefore, 
approaches to measuring the level of engagement in a museum experience must 
necessarily be manifold. There cannot be one straightforward measure of engagement, 
but rather multiple measures can be brought together to address these diverse aspects of 
engagement, such as attention, enjoyment, interest, and emotion.  
However, a full exploration of engagement also requires an understanding of the lasting 
impact of a museum experience, thus suggesting the importance of longitudinal studies 
(Anderson, 2003; Anderson & Shimizu, 2007; Falk & Dierking, 1990, 1997; Medved et 
al., 2004; Medved & Oatley, 2000). Memory traces are known to require time to 
become consolidated (McGaugh, 1966, 2000). By assessing what traces of information 
or what aspects of the experience remain in a visitor’s mind weeks or months later, and 
combining these with an understanding of attention, interest and emotion, conclusions 
can be reached regarding levels of engagement.  
As demonstrated in Chapter 3, measuring memorability is a holistic way to explore 
impact, as autobiographical memory theory can be used to analyse the fully experiential 
nature of museum visits. It also arguably provides a way to understand the impact of a 
museum visit, on the basis that if something is retained in memory, then it has made 
some degree of impact upon the individual. If a visitor has been fully engaged in the 
museum, then the result may be a rich autobiographical memory, which may combine 
details of the museum environment and events specific to the visit with emotions, 

103 
 
 
cognitions, and conceptual knowledge related to the museum’s collections. Such 
responses, and the subsequent creation of memorable and rich experiences, would 
typically be considered evidence of ‘engagement’ in the museum. Evaluating 
memorability about an aspect of a museum experience, such as recall of a particular 
exhibit, also develops understanding of the level of engagement with that particular 
exhibit and whether or not learning (incidental or intentional) took place.  Increased 
memorability would also be indicative of a deeper or broader level of processing having 
taken place (Craik, 2002).  
This study therefore seeks to compare three ways of experiencing an exhibition. Firstly, 
through vision only, with minimal text labels, thereby replicating a typical experience of 
a museum’s permanent collections. Secondly, through viewing the artworks whilst 
listening to a standard audio guide (SAG), which provides factual and contextual 
information. Thirdly, through viewing the artworks with an audio descriptive guide 
(ADG), which guides the viewer’s attention around the image, builds a narrative, 
employs multisensory imagery and also provides semantic information. This study 
explores the experience and levels of engagement both immediately after the event 
(time A) and one month later (time B), incorporating measures of attention, interest, 
enjoyment and emotion. Furthermore, it applies an adapted version of the coding model 
set out in Chapter 3 to participants’ memories of the photos as an important way of 
exploring the experience of seeing the photos, and to ascertain to what extent the 
experience was engaging. The study brings these aspects together in order to address the 
following research question: whether using AD to present an exhibition would have an 
impact on the experience and engagement of sighted people, when evaluated through a 
series of enjoyment, interest, attention, emotion and memorability measures. 
Methods 
Design 
This was a longitudinal study (time A, time B) with an independent groups design. The 
independent variables were time (exit, 1 month) and experience: no audio (NA); audio 
guide (AG); audio description (AD). The dependent variables were measures of 
attention, enjoyment of the experience, desire to reengage and actual reengagement, 
emotion, thoughts and memories evoked during the exhibition, the experience of 
listening (for AG and AD participants), recall of the photos and richness of recall. A 

104 
 
 
mixed methods approach included thematic coding of participants’ answers to free-text 
responses. For the photo recall text answers, the texts were coded to provide counts for 
various content detail categories, which were as follows: visual, spatial, 
event/activity/movement, emotion (perceived emotion of photo subjects) and 
atmosphere (including nonvisual imagery), participants’ reactions (emotions, thoughts, 
and memories mentioned during photo recall), and semantic recall (socio-historical 
information/context and information about the photographer). The data were analysed 
using ANOVAs, but where the data distribution of the DVs was not normal, and 
normality could not be achieved using transformations, nonparametric tests were 
applied. 
Participants 
149 participants were recruited via the University of Westminster’s Psychology 
Research Participation Scheme; the University of the Third Age (U3A), the Museum of 
London’s Friends of the Museum mailing list, and through snowball sampling. One 
participant had a high level of familiarity with the photographs and was excluded from 
the sample. 
Participants were approximately matched for age and gender, and then randomly 
allocated to one of three conditions: no audio, SAG, and ADG (see Table 4.1).

Materials 
Selection of the photographs: Photographs were selected from the Museum of London’s 
Henry Grant archive. Through discussion with the curator, 9 photos were chosen that 
were all: a) taken between 1950 and 1970 b) taken outside, c) black and white, d) 
containing people, but with a clear focal point (e.g. crowd scenes were avoided); e) 
considered optimal for the use of multisensory imagery in the texts of the audio 
descriptions. The photo shown below is an example of one of the 9 selected:

Please see appendix 3.1 for the rest of the photos. 
Audio Interpretation: SAGs and ADGs were produced for the study. The AD texts were 
quality controlled by the organisation VocalEyes to ensure they were considered 
representative of professional-standard AD provided in museums and galleries. Please 
see appendix 3.2 for examples of the texts. 
Factual and Contextual information: The two audio conditions included an audio 
introduction with some biographical information about the photographer and his 
practice. An excerpt of this information was summarised and presented on the initial 

106 
 
 
slide for the ‘no audio’ condition. Both SAGs and ADGs provided factual and 
contextual information, which was gathered in consultation with the Museum of 
London’s photography curator. This information was given in a more expanded form in 
the SAG and was condensed for the ADG, but wherever possible, the same semantic 
information was presented in both texts. The SAGs referred to some visual features of 
the photos but they did not systematically guide visual attention in the way that the 
ADG texts did. 
Duration: the mean (SD) durations in seconds were as follows: SAG=2 minutes 35 
seconds (17.8 seconds), ADG=3 minutes 41 seconds (26.8 seconds). The shortest SAG 
was 2 minutes 4 seconds, the longest 3 minutes 9 seconds. The shortest ADG was 3 
minutes 2 seconds, the longest 4 minutes 16 seconds. The ADG texts were necessarily 
longer than the SAG texts, to allow for the provision of the description as well as 
equivalent semantic information. 
Measures 
Two questionnaires (time A, time B) were designed for the experiment (see appendix 
3.3 and 3.4). One was administered in person after the participants had viewed the 
photos. The second was sent one month later, and was completed online via a link to the 
questionnaire hosted on the Qualtrics platform. The questionnaire at both times A and B 
addressed the participant’s experience and engagement levels, with the questionnaire at 
time B also addressing memorability for the photos. 
The first questionnaire (time A) collected the following information through a 
combination of quantitative and qualitative measures: 
Demographic information: age, gender, level of education, whether English was their 
first language and level of English if not. Participants were asked about their museum 
visiting habits. They were asked to select from a 6-point Likert Scale to confirm their 
frequency of museum visits over the last 5 years. 
Experience and Engagement measures: At time A, the time spent by participants on 
each photo was logged, and their time spent reviewing the photos, if they chose to do 
so. Participants gave likings ratings for the photos on a 7-point Likert Scale, where 
1=hated it and 7= loved it. They also completed the 7-item motivation scale of the IMI 
Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, which has been validated for the measurement of 
enjoyment and engagement (Ryan, 1982). The scale asked participants to rate aspects of 

107 
 
 
enjoyment, fun and interest, and to what extent the activity held their attention, on a 
scale of 1-7 where 1= not at all true and 7=very true. Furthermore, they stated how 
likely they would be to want to view more of the Museum of London’s photography 
collections, based on a 5-point Likert scale, where 1= don’t know, 2= definitely not and 
5= definitely. Participants were asked if they experienced any emotion (s), and if so to 
name their emotions by selecting from a list, and if so, to rate emotions for valence and 
strength on ten-point Likert scales (where 1= negative and 10=positive for valence, and 
1=barely noticeable and 10=as strong as I have ever felt, for strength). They rated their 
mental images of the photos for clarity on a ten-point Likert scale (1= no image, just 
know I am thinking about it, and 10= as clear as if I were actually looking at the photo) 
and described any memories evoked during the exhibition, and rated their vividness, 
again on a ten-point scale. The listening experience was assessed through participants 
(SAG, ADG) rating their experience of the audio by rating 4 items about the audio 
guides on ten-point Likert Scales (1=really hated it, 10=really loved it), namely 
information, delivery, speed and their enjoyment of it. They were also asked how they 
would describe the audio guide to a friend. Finally, participants described their thoughts 
during the exhibition, whether related to the activity or not. At time B, participants were 
asked whether they had engaged further with the content of the exhibition since the 
experiment, by either thinking about the photos, talking to someone about them or 
trying to find out more.   
Memorability measures: The Time B questionnaire asked participants to recall the 
photos by describing them, giving as much information as they could, and by rating 
each one for liking and mental image. Responses were coded for content (for the types 
of content, see Design) Participants in the SAG and ADG groups repeated the audio 
evaluation measures.  
Data Coding: 10% of the photo recall texts were coded by a second, independent rater. 
The second coder was given detailed instructions, including examples (see appendix 
3.5). Inter-rater agreement was 92.17% for the sample. 
Procedure 
Participants were all tested in a quiet room with no external distraction, either at the 
Museum of London, a laboratory at the University of Westminster, or in their own 
home. All 9 photographs were presented in a fixed order to participants in a PowerPoint 
presentation on a laptop or desktop computer with a minimum screen size of 13.5 

108 
 
 
inches. For the audio conditions, an embedded Mp3 file accompanied each photo, and 
commenced playback automatically as the slide was reached. Participants listened 
through headphones.  For the SAG and ADG conditions, participants were invited to 
check the headphone volume was comfortable, then they were asked to open the 
PowerPoint presentation when they were ready and to move on to the next image once 
the audio had completed playback. Participants in the no audio condition were invited to 
look at the images for as long as they would like to, before moving on to the next. All 
participants were told that they would have the chance to look again at any of the 
images at the end of the presentation, and the final slide contained thumbnails of all 9 
images which they could use to navigate the photos as they wished. No time limit was 
set for their exploration of the images. 
Once they had indicated that they had seen enough, participants completed a paper 
questionnaire about their experience. They were then thanked for their time, and 
reminded that they would receive a link by email in a month’s time to the follow up 
questionnaire, after which time they would be debriefed. 
Results 
Participant demographics and time taken to follow up 
One hundred and twenty-seven participants responded to both stages of the experiment. 
The distribution across conditions was: NA= 44, SAG=38, ADG=45.  
In the NA (no audio) group, the mean (SD) age was 51.75 (25.09); 9 males and 35 
females. In the SAG group, the mean (SD) age was 48.79 (25.03); 11 males and 27 
females. In the ADG group, the mean (SD) age was 51.43 (19.95); 15 males and 30 
females. A one way between subjects ANOVA confirmed no difference in age between 
groups: (F (2, 122) =.19, p=.83). 
The mean (SD) number of years of education of participants was NA= 15.14 (3.98), 
SAG=15.39 (3.77) and ADG=16.33 (3.33). A one way between-subjects ANOVA 
confirmed no difference between participant groups for the number of years of 
education they had received: (F (2, 120) =1.28, p=.29). Thirteen per cent of NA 
participants did not speak English as a first language, compared to 32% of SAG 
participants and 18% of ADG participants. For non-native speakers of English, the 
median (range) levels of English were: NA=4 (3), SAG=4 (1), ADG=4 (2), with 4 

109 
 
 
meaning ‘fluent’, which was the maximum value. A Kruskal Wallis test confirmed there 
was no difference between groups in terms of the level of English of non-native 
speakers: (chi sq=0.42, df=2, NA N=5, SAG=12, ADG=8, p= .81). 
All participant groups were, on average, frequent visitors to museums, with the median 
response being 5 (once a month), with slightly more variability in the NA group (range 
4) than in the other two groups (range 3). A Kruskal Wallis test confirmed there was no 
difference between groups in the frequency with which they visited museums over the 
last 5 years: (chi sq= 3.44, df=2, NA N=27, SAG N= 22, ADG N=32, p=.18). 
Finally, the mean (SD) number of days between Time A (exit) and B (follow-up) was as 
follows: NA=32.70 (4.96), SAG=31.61 (4.25), ADG=32.53 (5.61). A Kruskall Wallis 
test was performed on the data which confirmed no differences between groups for the 
time taken to follow up: (chi sq= 1.26, df=2, NA N=44, SAG N= 38, ADG N=45, 
p=.53) 
Experience and engagement 
Attention 
Participants in the audio groups listened for the duration of the audio introduction and 
photo descriptions; 25 minutes 18 seconds for the SAG and 35 minutes 10 seconds for 
the ADG. Participants in the NA group (N=43) spent a mean time of 2 minutes 50 
seconds (SD=1 minute 23 seconds) looking at the photos in the first instance (total view 
time). All participants were then invited to look again, if they wished. The frequency of 
participants who continued to browse the photos and their mean additional browse time 
is shown below:

Enjoyment of the experience 
Time A: The mean (SD) Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores for the three conditions 
were similar, although there was more variability in the NA group: NA= 35.34 (14.84), 
SAG=38.37 (8.56) and ADG=38.31 (9.42) (max score=49). A Kruskal Wallis test 
confirmed there were no differences in IMI scores between groups: (chi sq=1.35, df=2, 
NA N=44, SAG N=38, ADG N=45), p=.508.) 
The mean liking scores for the 9 photos was calculated for Time A and B. At time A, 
the mean (SD) liking score for the NA group was 5.27 (0.58), it was 5.43 (0.68) for the 
SAG group and 5.43 (0.66) for the ADG group. At time B, the mean (SD) likings rating 
continued to be similar between groups: NA (n=38) mean= 6.43 (3.55), SAG (n=36) 
mean=5.23 (1.77), ADG (n=45) mean = 5.36 (1.76). Kruskal -Wallis tests confirmed no 
difference between the three groups either at Time A: (chi sq=.089, NA N=44, SAG N= 
38, ADG N=45 df=2, p=.64), or Time B: (chi sq= 0.93, df=2, NA N=38, SAG N= 36, 
ADG N=45, p=.63). 
This analysis suggests that enjoyment of the experience and the photos was similar 
across participant groups. 
Desire to reengage and actual reengagement 

111 
 
 
Time A: When asked how likely they would be to want to view more photos, the 
median score for the NA group was 4 (probably), with a range of 2. In the SAG 
condition, median and range were 4.5 (2) and in the ADG condition 5 (2), where 
5=definitely. A Kruskal-Wallis test showed no significant differences between 
conditions: (chi sq= 1.50, df=2, NA N=42, SAG N= 38, ADG N=45, p=.47). 
Time B: At follow up, participants were asked whether they had thought about the 
photos or talked to anyone about them since, if they had tried to find out any further 
information, or engaged further with the museum. In the NA group, 40% gave a positive 
response to this question, compared to 68% in the SAG group and 60% in the ADG 
group. A multi-dimensional chi-sq test confirmed that there was a relationship between 
participant group and follow-up engagement: (chi sq (2, N=125)= 7.37, p=.025). For the 
70 participants who reported follow up engagement, the breakdown was as follows:

Emotion 
Time A: Participants were asked to think about their favourite and least favourite 
photos, and then to report whether they experienced any emotion. The presence of 
emotion reported was similar across groups. In the NA group, 88% of participants 
reported emotion for their favourite photo, compared to 95% for the SAG group and 

113 
 
 
87% for the ADG group. For the least favourite photo, these findings were 55%, 41% 
and 52% respectively. 
Participants selected emotions that they experienced whilst looking at the photos, with 
focus on the favourite and least favourite photos. In the NA condition, the mean (SD) 
number of emotions recorded was 2.7 (1.42) for the favourite photo. In the SAG 
condition, it was 3.14 (1.84) and in the ADG condition it was 3.19 (1.72). A one -way 
ANOVA confirmed no significant differences between research conditions for the 
number of emotions recorded for the favourite photo: (F (2,116)=1.04, p=.36). This 
indicates that participants’ emotional responses were similar across groups. 
Memories, Memory Vividness and Mental Imagery 
The majority of participants across groups stated at Time A that the Henry Grant 
exhibition evoked memories: 91% of participants in the NA group, 97% in the SAG 
group and 95% in the ADG group. Participants across groups recalled similar number of 
memories when responding to the questions ‘did any memories come to mind?’ and/or 
‘what were you thinking about during the exhibition?’. In the NA group, the mean 
number of memories recalled was 1.55 (1.55), in the SAG group 1.37 (1.26) and in the 
ADG group 1.73 (SD=1.71) A Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed no differences between 
groups (chi sq=0.509, df=2, NA N=44, SAG N=38, ADG N=45, p=.78) The vividness 
ratings for these memories was similar across groups: NA (n=38) median 8, range 9, 
SAG (n=37), median 9, range 5 and ADG (n=41) median 8, range 8. A Kuskall-Wallis 
test confirmed no difference between groups in terms of the vividness of memories 
evoked: (chi sq= 0.24, df=2, NA N=38, SAG N= 37, ADG N=41, p=.89). Thus, 
participants in all three groups recalled similar numbers of memories with similar levels 
of vividness. 
Participants’ rating of the clarity of their mental images for their favourite photo was 
similar for NA and SAG, with a slightly higher rating and less variability in the ADG 
group: NA= (n=44) Median =8, range=6, SAG (n=38) median =8, range=9, ADG 
(n=45) median=9, range=4. A Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed there was a significant 
difference between groups: (chi sq= 8.15, df=2, NA N=44, SAG N= 38, ADG N=45, 
p=.017), suggesting that ADG participants reported clearer mental images. When asked 
to consider their least favourite photo, clarity ratings were as follows: NA (n=44) 
median 6 range 8, SAG (n=38) median 8 range 9 and ADG (n=45) median 8 range 6. A 
Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed there was a significant difference between groups: (chi 

114 
 
 
sq= 23.913, df=2, NA N=44, SAG N= 38, ADG N=45, p<.001), suggesting that 
participants who had listened to audio had clearer mental images. There were no 
differences between groups for mental image vividness of the photos they recalled at 
time B as confirmed by a one-way ANOVA: (F (2, 115) =1.38, p=.26). Therefore, the 
effect of clearer mental images for ADG participants at time A was not sustained by 
time B. 
The Listening Experience 
For participants in the SAG and ADG groups, the mean (SD) audio evaluation scores at 
Times A and B were calculated by totalling the four measures taken (enjoyment, 
delivery, speed of guide, information provided), with the maximum possible score being 
40. The audio evaluation score had a Cronbach’s alpha of .83, indicating high internal 
consistency. For SAG participants, the mean total audio evaluation score was 29.66 
(8.21) at Time A, and 25.55 (9.22) at time B. For ADG participants, the mean total 
audio evaluation score was 31.79 (6.76) at Time A, and 28.26 (7.91) at time B. A mixed 
2 (Time A, Time B) x 2 (participant group SAG, ADG) ANOVA showed a main effect 
of time: (F (1, 78) =37.64, p<.001), but no main effect of participant group (F (1, 
78)=2.05, p=.16), and no interaction effect (F (1,78) =0.219, p=.64). In other words, the 
evaluation scores were lower at Time B, but there were no differences between SAG 
and ADG participants in terms of their appreciation of the audio guides. 
Qualitative analysis of the listening experience: Participants in the SAG and ADG 
groups answered the question ‘Thinking about the Audio Guide that you heard, if you 
were to describe it to a friend, what would you say?’. Within these answers, there were 
6 references to duration from the SAG group (16%) and 6 from the ADG group (13%), 
in all cases reporting that it was too long. Seven SAG and 7 ADG participants (18% and 
16 % respectively) commented on the impact of the guide on independence of thought 
whilst listening. In both groups, 4 participants referred to a negative impact, and 3 to a 
positive impact. Negative comments indicated that the audio inhibited independence of 
thought: ‘coloured the opinion I might have otherwise formed myself on the people in 
the picture’ (ADG participant), ‘Left little to the viewer's imagination’ (SAG 
participant). Positive comments indicated that the audio facilitated imagination: 
‘(helped) to make the audience imagine what the environment was like for the subjects 
captured’ (ADG participant), ‘(the audio) expanded upon the initial thoughts I had when 
looking at the photo’ (SAG participant).The incidence of negative observations 

115 
 
 
regarding the guides’ duration and its negative impact on the participant’s own person 
response were relatively low (all 16% or under). 
Participants’ response to this question were also coded for participant reactions, which 
included thoughts and emotions. In the SAG group, there were 65 reactions from 33 
participants (87% of SAG sample), compared to 110 reactions from 43 participants in 
the ADG group (96% of ADG sample).   To understand the types of reactions, and 
thereby the nature of the experience, the reactions were broken down into three groups: 
negative, neutral and positive. In the SAG group, 74% of participants recorded a 
positive reaction, 21% a neutral reaction and 16% a negative reaction, with 21% of 
participants having mixed reactions. In the ADG group, 78% of participants had a 
positive reaction, 31% a neutral reaction and 24% a negative reaction, with 27% having 
a mixed response.  
Positive reactions included expressions of enjoyment and interest or other positive 
reflections on the guide, such as ‘Overall enriched the experience of the material’ (ADG 
participant) or ‘(the guide) showed a side of photography I had not previously 
considered’ (SAG participant). Neutral reactions included observations such as the 
guide was informative or precise or comprehensive. Negative reactions included 3 
instances of boredom or irritation with the guide (all from SAG participants) and the 
rest of the category predominately consisted of observations that the content was too 
detailed or that the participant would have designed it differently (for example more or 
less historical information.) In summary, positive and negatively valenced responses 
were fairly evenly spread across the ADG and SAG groups, but the ADG participants 
had more reactions to the guide. Some participants also commented that the audio 
helped them to understand the composition of the photos: 27% of the ADG group and 
5% of the SAG group. Finally, there were 23 thoughts recorded that were generated by 
the audio guide, 7 from SAG participants (18%) and 16 (36%) from ADG participants. 
These included reflections about London and about changes over time: ‘Made me think 
about how London is an iconic city with a very rich history’ (ADG participant) ‘(I was) 
thinking of how things had changed’ (ADG participant) 
Thoughts during the exhibition 
Analysis of participants’ thoughts indicated that they were similar across groups. 
Participants in each group were thinking about the past; 15 in the NA group (34%), 16 
from the SAG group (42%) and 22 from the ADG group (49%). Some of these thoughts 

116 
 
 
were autobiographical memories and others referred to memories being evoked (but 
without stating what they were). A small number of people from each group were 
thinking about the future; 8 from the NA group (18%), 5 from the SAG group (13%) 
and 4 from the ADG group (9%). These comments included the desire to see more 
photos, and wondering how friends/family might react to the photos.   
Most of the participants’ reactions (thoughts and emotions) were related to the task and 
its content.  Positive reactions included expressions of enjoyment and interest, and 
positive thoughts about the photos and the subject matter. Neutral reactions included 
emotions that were not positively or negatively valanced such as surprise or nostalgia 
and thoughts that were neutral observations about the subject matter, such as ‘how 
similar to contemporary London some pictures looked’ (NA participant) or ‘I was 
thinking about the lives of the people in the photos’ (ADG participant). Negative 
reactions included boredom with the audio (1 SAG participant) and a mixture of 
negative reactions to the photos themselves (for example distaste at the subject matter 
such as eels or pigeons). 
Memorability 
Photo recall 
The mean (SD) number of photos recalled was as follows: NA: 3.86 (2.10), SAG: 5.46 
(2.06), ADG =5.58 (2.37). A one-way ANOVA on photo recall confirmed a significant 
effect of research condition: (F (2, 123) =8.27, p<.001). Bonferroni corrected post hoc 
comparisons confirmed a difference between both SAG and NA: mean difference= 
1.60, (95% CI: 0.41, 2.78), p=.001, and ADG and NA: mean difference= 1.71, (95% CI: 
0.59, 2.84), p<.001). There was no difference between SAG and ADG (p=.808). 
Richness of photo recall and content types 
The mean word count provided in the recall of the photos was also analysed. The mean 
(SD) word count provided by participants in the NA condition was 24.70 (14.59), in the 
SAG condition it was 32.30 (22.15), and in the ADG condition it was 39.38 (26.97). A 
one-way ANOVA confirmed an effect of participant group: (F (2, 121) =4.72, p=.011). 
Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons confirmed the word count of ADG 
participants was higher than that of NA participants: mean difference=15.56, (95% CI: 
4.00, 27.12), p=.003. No other differences were significant (all p>.13).

The photo recall texts were coded for content details and the mean total details 
recorded. Three participants in the NA group followed up but did not recall any photos 
and so were excluded from the content analysis. The mean (SD) total details recalled 
were as follows: NA (N=41) 25.24 (17.49), SAG (N=38) 39.45 (22.32), ADG (N=45) 
57.31 (43.39). A square root transformation was conducted on the total details variable 
to render it suitable for analysis by means of a one-way ANOVA, which confirmed a 
significant effect of participant group: F (2, 121) =11.14, p<.001. Bonferroni-Holm 
corrected pairwise comparisons on the square root transformed variable confirmed that 
ADG participants recalled more details compared to NA participants, mean difference 
2.29 (95% CI: 1.33, 3.25), p<.001. ADG participants also recalled more details than 
SAG participants: mean difference 1.05 (95% CI: 0.7, 2.03), p=.036. More details were 
also recalled by SAG participants compared to NA participants: mean difference 1.24 
(95% CI: 0.24,2.24), p=.032. 
Finally, participants’ recall of the photos were scored for detail types. Mean counts by 
participant group are presented in Figure 4.1: 
 
Figure 4.1: Mean (SD) frequencies of detail types recalled by participant group, at Time B 
Figure 4.1 suggests that content related details (visual details) was the most salient 
category for all participant groups, with the other categories being comparable in size. 
The amount and distribution of data points within the categories did not permit further 
analysis.

To address the possibility that the richer recall with AD was due to the fact that 
participants spent longer listening to the ADG than the SAG, a correlation analysis was 
conducted on the total time spent looking at the photos and the number of details 
recalled at time B for ADG and SAG participants. It confirmed there was no significant 
relationship:  rs =0.038, N= 78, p=.74. Therefore, ADG participants’ recall of more 
details could not be attributed to the fact that the ADG audio files were longer in 
duration. 
Discussion 
This study sought to explore the impact of AD on the experience of sighted people 
viewing a photography exhibition. In so doing, it compared AD to two common ways of 
experiencing museums (for sighted visitors), namely visual access only to artworks, 
with minimal text presented alongside, and visual access accompanied by an audio 
guide for information and context. The nature of the resulting experiences, and the 
levels of engagement were examined. Overall, results indicated that the participants’ 
enjoyment and emotional response was broadly similar, regardless of the experience 
group (NA, SAG, ADG) in which they took part. However, memorability findings 
revealed that participants who listened to audio interpretation recalled more photos than 
those who just looked. Furthermore, participants who experienced the photos with ADG 
had richer memories of the photos, compared to either those who had no audio, or the 
standard audio guide. It is therefore important to explore the impact of a) listening to 
audio (either SAG or ADG) and b) the impact of AD specifically. 
Standard audio guide, audio descriptive guide or visual exploration 
alone: similarities and differences in experience, engagement and 
memorability 
Firstly, there were a number of similarities in the nature of the experience for 
participants from all three groups, no audio, SAG and ADG. Enjoyment was similar 
across groups, as demonstrated by the IMI inventory (Ryan, 1982), the mean likings 
ratings for the photos, the audio evaluation and the qualitative data. In other words, 
participants enjoyed the experience similarly regardless of which group they were in. 
Furthermore, it was evident from the emotional responses to the artworks and the 
evocation of autobiographical memories that the experience had provoked responses in 
the participants across all three groups. The emotional response to the photos was 

119 
 
 
similar in all three groups, as were the numbers of autobiographical memories recorded 
across groups. There were also no differences in the level of vividness of these 
memories, suggesting that the audio was not interfering with the experience of 
reminiscing.  
These findings present a different picture to other research on audio guides, which 
found that guides did not strongly elicit emotion or call up personal memories (Bertens 
& Polak, 2019). It is possible that the subject matter of the photos used in this study 
(London street photography) was quite evocative for the participants, many of whom 
were Londoners, living in or familiar with London. Further research would therefore be 
needed to explore the role of audio interpretation in evoking emotions and memories.  
Interest levels were also assessed by asking participants to describe what they were 
thinking about during the task. Had participants described mostly unrelated thoughts, 
that would have suggested a lack of interest in the experience. However, the majority of 
participants across groups reported thoughts related to the task or the photos, which 
were similar across groups in terms of their positive and negative valence, suggesting 
similar levels of interest. The initial desire to re-engage with the subject matter was also 
the same across groups, with all groups expressing a relatively high interest in returning 
to the subject matter (‘probably-definitely’). This is also indicative of a broadly 
consistent level of initial interest across the three participant groups.  
At time B, it was notable that the pattern of content in the photo recall was broadly 
similar across groups, with visual details being the most salient, and other details 
categories being similar across groups in terms of salience. The presence of thoughts, 
emotions and the recall of semantic information indicated that a level of cognitive 
engagement took place across all three participant groups.  This suggests that a certain 
level of engagement was possible through visual exploration alone, but this should be 
contextualised with the fact that an audio experience of the photos impacted more on the 
lasting memories of the artworks. 
The key differences between the participants who listened to audio and those who did 
not were revealed through the measures of attention, memorability and subsequent 
engagement (between times A and B). Firstly, the NA group’s average interaction with 
the photos was brief (a mean time of 18 seconds per image at first viewing) compared to 
the 25-35-minute total duration of the SAG or ADG experience. NA participants 
therefore had only a quick glance at the photos in comparison to the relatively lengthy 

120 
 
 
time spent looking and listening by the audio text participants. This is in accordance 
with previous research that demonstrated that audio guides help to hold attention, 
causing visitors to spend longer in front of exhibits (Sung, Yeo-Ting; Chang, Kuo-En; 
Lee, Yi-Hsuan; Yu, 2008), and that looking alone results in a short viewing time only 
(Smith & Smith, 2001; Smith et al., 2017). It therefore seems likely that the use of audio 
altered participants’ patterns of attention, as they were encouraged to attend to the 
images for longer, and that the prolonged attention increased the opportunity to activate 
representations in memory (Renninger & Hidi, 2015).  
Correspondingly, the use of audio interpretation resulted in higher recall of the photos at 
time B. It could therefore be suggested that the increased recall in the audio groups was 
due to the increased looking time. However, there was no significant correlation 
between details recalled and time spent looking. Levels of processing research has 
shown that further ‘shallow’ processing (for example, allowing more time on shallow 
processing tasks) does not increase recall (Craik, 2002). This suggests that it was the 
depth of processing permitted by the audio guides rather than the sheer time spent that 
was important. Depth of processing was not measured in this study, except indirectly, 
through memory. However, increased recall of the photos is suggestive of deeper 
processing at the time of encoding, and it seems reasonable to suggest that the semantic 
and narrative information provided in the guides would have supported the creation of 
connections and meaning, thereby forming memory traces (Ekuni et al., 2011). A more 
deeply encoded stimulus, involving more memory traces, would provide more 
opportunities for cues to stimulate later recall (Ekuni et al., 2011; Ward, 2014). 
Furthermore, the audio guides, through provision of information, would help to 
integrate the stimulus of the photos into participants’ knowledge structure about the 
world and about themselves. This suggests the possibility that the use of audio could 
support processes of elaboration, whereby multiple aspects of meaning of an item are 
activated and thereby linked into the existing network of semantic associations (Bartsch, 
Singmann, & Oberauer, 2018).  
Furthermore, there were differences between the no audio, SAG and ADG groups in 
terms of the amount of engagement that took place between times A and B. Participants 
in the no audio group were less likely than the SAG and ADG participants to have come 
back to the photos, either in terms of their thoughts, conversations or follow up 
research. This suggests that by providing participants with additional interpretation, and 
therefore support to engage with the photos, the likelihood of sufficient interest 

121 
 
 
developing for future engagement to occur was increased. In other words, this later 
engagement is indicative of the triggering of interest during the initial encounter with 
the photos at time A. This is consistent with the literature on the triggering of interest 
and its relationship with the development of engagement (Renninger & Bachrach, 2015; 
Renninger & Hidi, 2015), as well as the importance of supporting content for the 
development of interest (Renninger & Hidi, 2011) . It is also consistent with recognition 
in museum practice that meaning-making, or making sense of experience, is to be 
achieved through the process of interpretation (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000). 
For those participants who did re-engage, the most common forms of re-engagement 
were conversations or thoughts about the experience, suggesting that sufficient interest 
had been triggered for social interactions related to the experience to occur, or for the 
participants to return to the experience in their thoughts even once they had returned to 
the course of everyday life. This provides further tentative support for the observations 
made in Chapter 3 about the importance of conversation and social sharing following a 
museum visit. Over a third of the SAG and ADG participants who chose to re-engage 
with the experience were interested enough to subsequently research the photos or 
photographer online. This suggests that the content of the audio guides was likely to 
arouse curiosity or a desire to learn more. Such indications of interest were lower in the 
‘no audio’ group, again suggesting the importance of the level of support provided by 
the audio.  
This is reinforced by the attention data, which showed that 77% of ‘no audio’ 
participants wished to look again at the photos, compared to 29% of SAG and 18% of 
ADG participants. Taken alone, this measure could suggest higher levels of interest in 
the photos amongst NA participants. However, when considered in conjunction with the 
other measures, it rather suggests that the initial visual encounter with the photos was 
felt to be in some way insufficient when it was not supported by audio interpretation, 
possibly due to its brevity. It is possible that the initial brief glance was not enough to 
access meaning, or a sense of having fully engaged with the photos. This would be 
consistent with the concept that processing based purely on perceptual experience is a 
shallower level of processing (Craik, 2002).  
It is possible that the re-engagement measures suggest higher levels of interest and 
curiosity in participants who listened to audio, to the extent that this influenced future 
behaviour between times A and B. If this were the case, then it may also have 

122 
 
 
contributed to the enhanced memorability, as increased interest is known to enhance 
memory (McGillivray, Murayama, & Castel, 2015; Renninger & Hidi, 2015), and 
curiosity has been associated with increased memorability for novel information (Kang 
et al., 2009) . Further work would however be needed to see if the effects of audio 
interpretation as suggested here could be replicated in other tasks and settings. In 
summary, whilst there were many similarities in the experience for participants, 
regardless of whether or not they listened to audio, the longitudinal nature of this study 
revealed important differences between those who listened to audio and those who did 
not, with regards to subsequent engagement and memorability a month later. 
The impact of AD on the participant experience, engagement and 
memorability: similarities and differences between SAG and ADG 
Whilst the use of audio interpretation (both SAG and ADG) clearly had an impact on 
the participants’ assimilation over the month between times A and B, it is important to 
understand where there are similarities and differences between the standard audio 
guides and the audio descriptive guides, in order to understand fully the potential for 
AD as Inclusive Design. Firstly, it is worth noting that there was a higher proportion of 
non-native speakers of English in the SAG condition compared to the other two groups. 
Nevertheless, the median self-reported level of English of non-native speakers in all 
groups was fluent, with no difference in the spread of English level between groups. 
The audio resources (SAG and ADG) were designed to be linguistically accessible. For 
example, the guides did not contain technical vocabulary or complex sentences with 
multiple subordinate clauses. Part of the quality control performed by VocalEyes sought 
to ensure that the ADG and SAG texts worked for listeners, rather than readers. Whilst 
the number of non-native English speakers in the SAG group was higher than in the 
ADG groups, the preparation of the audio texts should have helped to mitigate this 
variation. No participants expressed any difficulty in following the audio and they were 
all able to complete both questionnaires. 
There were a number of similarities between the SAG and ADG experiences, as 
demonstrated by the qualitative data on the participants’ listening experience. The 
majority of participants in both audio groups reported positive reactions to their 
experience of listening to the audio, with around 3 in 4 participants stating that they 
enjoyed it and found it enriched their experience of the photos. The reported concern 
about the problem of guides ‘telling you what to think’ (Mannion et al., 2015) was only 

123 
 
 
reflected in 11% of SAG participants and 9% of ADG participants who commented that 
they felt the guide interfered with their independence of thought.  
A similar number of participants felt on the contrary that the guides were useful for 
supporting the development of their own reactions to the photos: a split of opinion 
which was also found by Bertens & Polak (2019). There were negative comments in 
both groups (16% of the SAG group and 24% of the ADG group) regarding the 
experience more broadly. Many of these related to the guide being too detailed, which 
may indicate that both of the guides were at risk of being too cognitively demanding by 
overloading the listener with information. However, 21% of the comments made by 
SAG participants and 31% made by ADG participants were neutral reflections on the 
level of detail, precision or comprehensive nature of the guide, indicating that it was 
noticed but not disliked in many instances. In a real museum setting, participants would 
choose to move on to the next track if the level of detail became onerous, which would 
be likely to alleviate this concern. 
 There were low numbers of negative comments about the duration of the guides (16% 
in the SAG group and 13% in the ADG group). This was particularly interesting in 
terms of the ADG, which was the longest form of interpretation presented. These 
findings suggest that the relatively lengthy interpretation (up to 35 minutes for just 9 
photos) was well tolerated by participants, although it should be recognised that they 
were comfortably seated in a quiet environment. 
It is possible that the duration of the guides used in this study would be perceived 
differently in the context of museum fatigue (Bitgood, 2009), for example if the guides 
were in use in a busy museum environment where people were required to stand in front 
of an image. Several participants made comments to this effect. It has been suggested 
that ADGs can run between 45 and 60 minutes in duration (Chapter 2). However, 
duration should be critically reviewed in the light of research findings that suggest that 
audio guide users often do not complete an audio tour (Lee, 2017) and also that museum 
visitors typically spend 20 minutes or less in an exhibition, regardless of its size or 
subject matter (Serrell, 1997). It may be beneficial to limit the duration of both SAGs 
and ADGs and further research could usefully explore the optimal duration in various 
settings. The quantitative audio evaluation measure also confirmed that there were no 
differences between participants’ appreciation of the two audio types, although this was 
slightly lower at time B. It is possible that the demands that the guides made of 

124 
 
 
participants in terms of the level of detail were too great and that this became apparent 
as participants reconsidered their views four weeks later.  
Various barriers have been identified in the research literature with regards to the use of 
audio guides, including visitors’ perception that they don’t have enough time to use one 
(i.e. it will take too long), that they don’t want to listen to an authoritative voice 
(Mannion et al., 2015), that guides have an isolating effect on the visitor  (Aoki et al, 
2002) or that they reduce independence of thought (Bauer- Kroesbacher, 2013; but see 
Bertens & Polak, 2019). The concerns about the use of time and isolation are hard to 
unpick in the context of this study, as all participants viewed the photos individually, 
regardless of which experience group they were in, and the SAG and ADG participants 
did not choose how much time they spent viewing, as they were asked to listen to the 
full duration of the audio. Nevertheless, the measures analysed here suggest that the 
experience of listening to the audio did not hamper the participant’s personal reaction to 
the photos, or reduce their emotional response to them in any way.  
In summary, the concerns regarding audio guides were not borne out in these findings, 
as the guides did not have any negative impact on enjoyment. Rather, they appeared to 
enhance interest as indicated by later re-engagement. Furthermore, the nature of the 
listening experience and its impact on enjoyment was broadly similar across the two 
types of audio. This suggests that using audio descriptive techniques in audio 
interpretation would create more inclusive materials and that this would not have any 
negative impact on visitors’ enjoyment of the resources. 
There were, however, important differences between the SAG and ADG with regards to 
memorability. Crucially, ADG participants recalled the largest number of details about 
the photos. This demonstrates that whilst SAG and ADG participants recalled similar 
numbers of photos, the ADG participants had richer memories of what they had seen, 
with higher numbers of details. As the correlation analysis demonstrated, the richer 
memories with ADG cannot be attributed to longer looking time. Rather, there are 
multiple possible reasons why presentation of the photos with ADG was more 
memorable than the standard audio guide. 
The increased richness of memories may have been related to the ‘guided looking’ 
element of the ADG experience. It is possible that the congruent nature of the 
perceptual information and the semantic information delivered by the guide was able to 
support recall, with congruence in the presentation of stimuli being known to be 

125 
 
 
important in supporting recall in levels of processing tasks (Craik, 2002) . In contrast, 
traditional guides may stand to present competing auditory and visual information, 
which differs from the congruence of the ADG experience. Dividing attention is known 
to result in shallower encoding, as deeper encoding requires more attention (Craik 
2002). This limitation of traditional guides could have led to the SAG texts in this study 
having less of an impact on memorability than the ADG texts.  
Furthermore, when asked to rate their mental images of their favourite photos at time A, 
there was a difference in clarity ratings between participant groups, with participants in 
the ADG group reporting a higher average rating. This suggests that there was enhanced 
initial mental imagery formation in the ADG group. As visual imagery is known to be a 
predictor for memorability (Greenberg & Knowlton, 2014), this may also have 
contributed to the increased memorability in the ADG group. Exactly why AD should 
have led to the formation of clearer visual images initially cannot be determined, but it 
is possible that the guided looking allowed for a deeper assimilation of the visual 
content of the photos.  
Other, linguistic features of the AD may have impacted positively on memorability, 
such as multisensory imagery, narrative, and cognitive prompts. These techniques are 
important in AD (chapter 2) and were accordingly foregrounded in the creation of the 
ADG texts for this study. The fact that the AD was embedded with multisensory 
imagery may have had a part to play in enhancing recall (Chu & Downes, 2000; Eardley 
& Pring, 2006; Gottfried, Smith, Rugg, & Dolan, 2004). The formation of mental 
imagery has also been employed as an elaboration strategy to enhance learning (Bartsch 
et al., 2018; Dunlosky & Kane, 2007).  It is therefore possible that the use of 
multisensory imagery helped to create a richer imaginary landscape, with more images 
and associations that could later cue recall of the photo’s appearance, content or socio-
historical context.  
The use of narrative was also important in the AD. Whilst narrative was to some extent 
present in both sorts of audio texts, the SAG texts focused more on the provision of 
semantic information, whereas the ADG focused more on the imagined experience of 
the photos’ subjects, in order to build a story. It is possible that this use of narrative, 
alongside the use of cognitive prompts in the audio descriptions, may have aroused 
curiosity or interest, again with positive implications for memorability (Kang et al., 
2009). In the museum literature, narrative is understood as storytelling which evokes 

126 
 
 
feelings, memories and curiosity, thereby creating engagement (Nielsen, 2017). It is 
therefore consistent with such definitions that the provision of narrative and cognitive 
prompts would be associated with curiosity, increased engagement and memorability in 
these findings.  
This study does not allow us to dissociate between the effects of AD on attention 
(‘guided looking’) and the features of AD (multisensory imagery, narrative and 
cognitive prompts), therefore it is difficult to draw any conclusions about which aspects 
were most important for memorability. However, in practice, AD as an inclusive tool 
for museum interpretation would be likely to incorporate both guided looking for those 
with sight, and, to a greater or lesser extent (see Chapter 2) the features of multisensory 
imagery and cognitive prompts. Therefore, in terms of developing inclusive museum 
resources, this question is of theoretical rather than practical importance. As has been 
observed in the museum literature, the very purpose of meaning-making through 
interpretation is to create a memory (Nielsen, 2017). These findings suggest the ability 
of AD to do so to an extent previously untapped by standard audio guides. 
Summary 
This study was the first investigation of the impact of museum AD on the experience of 
sighted participants. The findings present a positive picture for the future use of AD in 
museums for sighted as well as blind visitors. Firstly, using audio encouraged 
participants to spend longer with the photos, and the use of audio increased re-
engagement with the experience between times A and B. The use of audio did not have 
the potential negative impacts on the user that have been raised by the audio guide 
research literature, although the data do suggest a need for care in terms of duration and 
level of detail. Secondly, AD was shown to offer advantages over a standard audio 
guide, due to its ability to create richer memories for the users. These findings suggest a 
strong case for museums both to increase their audio resources and to incorporate AD in 
their creation. Making use of audio description techniques in preparation of audio 
resources would not only adhere to Inclusive Design principles, and thereby help to 
create a more inclusive museum environment, but it would also stand to enhance the 
long-term impact of the museum visit for all visitors. Having established that AD has 
potential as a tool for Inclusive Design in museum interpretation, this thesis will now go 
on to explore factors that may increase the impact of AD further, for both blind and 
sighted visitors alike.

Chapter 5: The impact of enriched audio description 
on the exploration of Henry Grant photography, in 
people with and without sight 
 
Abstract 
This chapter explores the impact that sound enriched AD may have upon users with and 
without sight, when compared to standard AD, thereby exploring the use of additional 
perceptual information in AD. It presents the results of a study comparing the use of an 
ADG (audio descriptive guide) with an enriched audio descriptive guide (EDG), in 
which the AD was enriched with congruent sound effects. Participants, both BPS and 
sighted, were presented with 8 photos, half with ADG and half with EDG, in a 
randomised order. Experience, engagement and memorability were assessed through a 
combination of measures directly after the presentation (time A), and approximately 4 
weeks later (time B). Results demonstrated that the response to the experience was 
broadly similar for both BPS and sighted people, with high enjoyment levels and 
significantly more participants preferring the EDG. The photos presented with EDG 
were more memorable for BPS people than the ADG photos. Whereas sighted 
participants recalled more photos with ADG than BPS participants did, the BPS and 
sighted groups remembered equal number of photos and equal numbers of details for 
the EDG photos. This demonstrates that use of the EDG enhanced memorability in the 
BPS group to the extent that their recall was the same as the sighted group. The 
enjoyment of EDG in both groups suggests that it could be used within mainstream 
museum offerings as an inclusive tool, which would also enhance memorability and 
impact for BPS users who require the AD as access.

Introduction 
Chapter 4 demonstrated that ADGs were well received by sighted participants, and that 
no significant differences in experience emerged between the use of the standard audio 
guide (SAG) and the ADG. However, the ADG resulted in richer memories one month 
after the photos were viewed. This suggested that AD could be used in museum 
interpretation, creating inclusive resources and increasing the impact of the artworks or 
exhibits for all visitors, regardless of their level of vision. Having established the 
benefits of standard AD for the sighted audience, this research now goes on to explore 
how AD could be designed in order to enrich the experience further, for both blind and 
sighted visitors. 
One potential way to enrich AD is by adding sound effects. The use of sound in AD has 
been anecdotally reported by practitioners (Eardley et al., 2017) and AD specialists have 
suggested the mechanisms by which sound-enriched AD may be beneficial for their 
audiences. For example, Giansante (2013), an audio and AD producer for Art Beyond 
Sight (amongst others), encourages the use of sound in his AD training materials and 
claims that adding sound to AD can help to create mental images and memories of a 
sensory experience.  
Potential benefits of sound have also been discussed by AD researchers in Translation 
Studies (de Coster & Muehleis, 2007; Neves, 2012, 2016). Neves’ (2012) notion of 
‘soundpainting’ proposes adding sound and music to AD on the basis that they may 
stimulate emotion, thereby encouraging a richer art experience. Building on 
soundpainting, Neves later proposed ‘enriched descriptive guides’ (2016), which offer 
factual information that ‘has been “enriched” through the creative use of description, 
sound effects and music, to provide thinking prompts that fuel the senses, invite 
cognitive and/or physical exploration, and capture the uniqueness of the cultural context 
the guide relates to’ (Neves, 2016, p.141). Crucially, such enriched descriptive guides 
(EDGs) would be intended for all visitors, not just those with a visual impairment.  
Neves (2016) presents the process through which EDGs were created for Qatari 
artworks as part of the ‘Art Translates Project.’ In these EDGs, sound and music were 
used to suggest geographical context, location and ambience. She reports that the use of 
sound was commented upon by research participants and described as ‘interesting’ or 
‘rich’, and suggests that the use of sound merits further research attention. It is notable 

129 
 
 
that empirical research comparing the use of sound-enriched guides with standard 
guides is rare, despite the fact that countless audio guides around the world make use of 
creative approaches to incorporating sound (Neves, 2016). Furthermore, there is no 
empirical research testing the presumed benefits of sound with regards to AD, through 
reception studies with blind and sighted museum visitors. This raises the question 
regarding the potential impact of sound on the cognitive experience of a museum visit.  
Sounds are already an important element in museum interpretation, and may be 
considered either diegetic, meaning belonging to the world of the story that is being 
presented, or non-diegetic, meaning coming from outside the world of the story 
(Bubaris, 2014). Museums frequently choose to use sounds in their interpretation, either 
through an audio guide delivery or, more often, in sound ‘zones’ within the museum. 
Mobile technologies are moving fast and encouraging new uses of sound (Bubaris, 
2014). For example, projects such as the LISTEN project (Zimmermann & Lorenz, 
2007) have evaluated motion-sensitive technological developments that aim to integrate 
visual and aural perception and create an immersive audio-augmented environment for 
museum visitors. However, there is relatively little information on the impact of sound 
specifically on the user experience, although a number of assumed benefits such as 
attention, interest, imagination, emotion and memorability have been explored in the 
museum research literature, and in the research literatures of other media. 
Firstly, sound is generally understood to help attract museum visitors’ attention and 
develop their interest (Bubaris, 2014). For example, Marshall et al (2016) developed 
sound-enriched audio interpretation to aid exploration of a First World War site in the 
Italian Alps, which they compared to a more objective factual audio text. Observation 
data showed that sounds were successful in capturing visitors’ attention and attracting 
them to areas of interest, and the qualitative data showed that participants who had 
listened to the sound enriched provision had a higher desire to know more about the 
content, suggesting higher levels of interest (Marshall et al., 2016). However, the use of 
sound was not isolated as a variable in this study, as the sound-enriched text also 
included different semantic content to the non-enriched text, such as personal accounts 
(Marshall et al., 2016). Furthermore, the sound-enriched interpretation was delivered 
through open-air listening stations, rather than audio guides, leaving the question 
unresolved of whether sound-enriched audio guides would have a similar impact on 
attention and interest.  

130 
 
 
Empirical studies from other media also contribute findings which suggest benefits of 
sound. Early studies in television (Calvert & Gersh, 1987) assessed the impact of sound 
effects on attention, by adding sounds to a difficult to understand dream sequence in a 
children’s TV programme and comparing children’s visual attention and comprehension 
with/without the sounds. Calvert & Gersh (1987) showed that the sounds increased 
visual attention and improved comprehension and, furthermore, they suggested they 
may also have increased interest in the content amongst the male participants.  
Research in radio also brings insight to the use of sound. Rodero (2012) suggested that 
the use of sound effects in audio drama would stimulate and maintain attention and 
interest using established self-report measures. She compared audio drama with/without 
additional sound effects, finding that sound effects were effective at enhancing listener 
attention. Rodero concluded that sound effects might enhance memorability, although it 
was not directly measured in this study. Rodero (2012) suggested that the use of sounds 
creates a richer sensory experience that may help to generate mental imagery, which is 
of particular relevance to radio, where there is no visual perception. The study (2012) 
also addressed the impact of sound on the generation of mental imagery, finding not 
only that sound helped to increase mental imagery (as self-reported by participants 
through established imagery questionnaires) but also that there was a relationship 
between the generation of mental imagery and increased attention, as demonstrated 
through correlation analysis.  
The potential of sound to enhance mental imagery creation is of particular potential 
importance for BPS museum visitors, for whom mental imagery may be one of the 
desired outcomes of listening to AD (see Chapter 2). Furthermore, research on radio 
advertising suggests that imagery used in radio advertising can engage memories of 
previous sensory experience, helping to make messages more personally relevant (Bolls 
& Lang, 2003). A comparison of high-imagery and low-imagery advertising also 
showed that participants reported higher involvement (attention, concentration and 
thinking) in response to the high-imagery condition (Bolls & Lang, 2003). It therefore 
seems possible that adding an extra layer of perceptual experience through sounds in 
AD would create easier opportunities for image creation, thereby stimulating 
imagination. 
Increased image generation may create further connections with the listener’s networks 
of existing semantic knowledge and memories, thereby providing more opportunities 

131 
 
 
for processes of elaboration to occur (Bubaris, 2014; Craik, 2002). This may also be 
expected to contribute to increased memorability (Craik, 2002). The additional 
perceptual experience and stimulation of imagination through sound may also enhance 
the experiential nature of being in the museum, bringing a sense of immediacy and 
participation (Bubaris, 2014) and help the visitor to imagine being in a different place or 
time. 
The presence of emotion is known to enhance autobiographical memory as emotion has 
a role to play in the way events are both encoded and consolidated (Holland & 
Kensinger, 2010), with emotional arousal triggering changes at a neurochemical and 
cellular level (Holland & Kensinger, 2010). This would suggest that arousing emotion 
in museum visitors stands to increase the long-term impact of a visit. It has also been 
widely proposed in the museum literature that the use of sounds enhances emotional 
engagement with the visit (Bertens & Polak, 2019; De Jong, 2018; Marshall et al., 
2016). This is deemed particularly important in today’s museology with its emphasis on 
the experiential nature of museums, where ‘feeling’ is as important as ‘learning’ (De 
Jong, 2018; Radder & Han, 2015). Furthermore, emotion may help build empathy, 
whereby the visitor engages with the imagined feelings of people in times past (De 
Jong, 2018). Emotion may therefore help drive engagement, and thereby further 
museums’ aim of providing their customers with sought after memorable events 
(Bubaris, 2014). 
 Although empirical investigations into the importance of sounds for arousing emotions 
and enhancing memorability in museums are very limited, research has suggested that 
the use of sound can increase visitors’ emotional connections to the subject matter, 
when assessed through qualitative analysis of visitor comments (Marshall et al., 2016). 
Similarly, Bertens & Polak (2019) found that the use of an audio guide enriched with 
ambient sound resulted in higher evaluation by participants of emotional engagement, 
although this suggestion should be regarded as tentative as it relies upon a single self-
report measure that was not interrogated with inferential statistical tests. Furthermore, as 
was the case with the study by Marshall et al (2016), the sound enriched guide 
contained different semantic content (here, emotions and memories of artists) to the 
non-enriched guide, meaning that the increased emotional connections cannot be 
attributed solely to the use of sound. 

132 
 
 
Nevertheless, the relationship between sound and emotion more generally is broadly 
accepted in the wider context, with environmental and ambient sounds as well as music 
and vocal sound being linked to increased emotion (Weninger, Eyben, Schuller, 
Mortillaro, & Scherer, 2013). Sound design in film is also deemed crucial to arousing 
emotion in the viewer (Fahlenbrach, 2008). In summary, sound may potentially enhance 
autobiographical memory if it is indeed able to increase attention, interest, mental 
imagery generation and emotion. 
It is also relevant to consider whether the use of sound effects is likely to have a similar 
impact on the experience and memorability of people with and without sight. Findings 
in the research literature related to memory in BPS people more generally, and sound 
specifically, present a mixed picture. Researchers of autobiographical memory in 
sighted people have identified the importance of visual imagery in autobiographical 
memory retrieval (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000; Williams, Healy, & Ellis, 1999). 
However, Eardley & Pring (2006) demonstrated that both congenitally blind people and 
sighted people draw upon cross-modal imagery to generate autobiographical memories. 
Nevertheless, they did observe a trend towards sighted participants generating more 
specific events than blind participants- both autobiographical memories and projections 
about the future, both of which may rely on imagery (Eardley & Pring, 2006). 
 Tekcan et al (2015) also reported fewer memories generated by blind participants in 
response to cue words compared to sighted. Their suggested explanation was that 
although autobiographical memory retrieval employs multisensory imagery, it is vision 
that is the most effective sense in integrating components of memory both at encoding 
and later rehearsal (Tekcan et al., 2015). An alternative explanation set out by Eardley& 
Pring (2014) is that imagery is more likely to be multisensory for sighted people, as 
their images are almost always accompanied by a visual image. Therefore, 
autobiographical memories for people with vision are more likely to be multisensory, 
and multisensory input is likely to make these memories more memorable.  
The studies by Tekcan et al. (2015) and Eardley & Pring (2006) were conducted using a 
cue word methodology whereby participants were asked if they were able to generate 
autobiographical memories in response to a specific word. The current research uses 
presentation of a stimulus and analyses later recall of it, thereby exploring participants’ 
memories for the stimuli over time. Participants are not asked for memories of the initial 
experience of the presentation, nor for memories of the event of taking part in the study. 

133 
 
 
As such, it addresses episodic information, in the form of a memory for a personal 
experience (Cohen & Conway, 2007). If such episodic information is integrated with 
knowledge about the self, then it may be considered an autobiographical memory.  
Whether or not such an integration applies here, the findings in the research literature 
that suggest lower autobiographical memory generation in BPS people nonetheless 
provide an interesting context. It is possible that sighted people may produce more 
memories in a longitudinal study, although this possibility is further complicated by the 
fact that some BPS people will have some or no visual experience, and others will have 
residual or largely intact visual memory. If autobiographical memory retrieval is lower 
in blind people compared to sighted people, then this may reduce the number of 
memories retrieved by BPS people overall.  
The study by Tekcan et al (2015) also looked at the effect of the age of memories on the 
imagery variables and metacognitive variables of recollection and belief, noting that the 
impact of the age of the memory on those variables was similar for both groups (blind 
and sighted). This suggested that age of the memory affected the patterns of the memory 
content in broadly similar ways in both groups, indicating that the processes underlying 
autobiographical memory are likely to be similar in both groups of participants in the 
current research. In summary, the structure of autobiographical memories could be 
similar in both BPS and sighted participants, but there is an open question regarding 
whether the level of recall may be subject to the variations between the two groups that 
are tentatively suggested by the research literature (Tekcan et al., (2015), Eardley & 
Pring, (2006). 
The importance of auditory imagery in autobiographical memory is also of potential 
importance. Tekcan et al (2015) found that blind participants reported higher auditory 
imagery at retrieval, with totally blind people recalling the highest auditory imagery. 
This appears to be consistent with observations in the research literature that blind 
people may make superior use of other senses, such as research that has demonstrated 
that blind people perform better than sighted on auditory perceptual tasks, even when 
musical experience is controlled for (Wan, Wood, Reutens, & Wilson, 2010). Sound 
effects may therefore be expected to be particularly beneficial to BPS participants, as 
the sound would provide a layer of perceptual experience, as opposed to merely the 
language of standard AD. 

134 
 
 
Fryer et al., (2013), wanted to explore the impact of sounds for an AD audience, and 
used audio drama with/without sound effects in order to evaluate the impact of sound 
effects on measures of presence (the feeling of being in the mediated environment). 
Whilst sound effects increased ratings of spatial presence and ecological validity in 
sighted people, there was no effect for blind participants, which brings in to question the 
possible benefit of sound for BPS participants. The authors suggested that some of the 
sound effects used may have had a distancing effect on the blind listener, and that the 
effort of assimilating distant sounds into their mental model of the scene would have 
reduced their sense of presence (Fryer et al., 2013). However, the lack of impact on BPS 
listeners may be specific to the measure of presence, and may not preclude other 
benefits, including memorability. Presence measures seek to understand the subjective 
experience of feeling immersed and engaged in a mediated environment (Lombard & 
Ditton, 1997, cited in Fryer, 2013). It is therefore possible that the picture for 
memorability may present differently, and indeed the research literature discussed 
above supports this suggestion (e.g. Marshall, 2016, Rodero, 2012, Bertens & Polak, 
2019). Furthermore, Fryer et al. (2013) are dealing with audio drama, which is a 
different type of stimuli to a museum audio guide. However, Fryer (2013) also reported 
on a task whereby BPS participants were asked to rate their mental imagery across sense 
modalities in response to both verbal stimuli and sound stimuli. Findings showed no 
difference between the two conditions for BPS participants. Therefore, the research 
literature presents a mixed picture regarding the importance of sound for people who are 
BPS. 
Sounds that are congruent with visual stimuli (e.g. image of dog and dog bark) have 
been shown to aid perceptual processing and memorability (e.g. Kim et al., 2008; von 
Kriegstein & Giraud, 2006, see Chapter 1). Relating this to AD for sighted people, 
enriching description of a visual image (e.g. a photo) with congruent sounds (e.g. 
market sounds presented as the audio guide discusses markets) could be expected to 
have a greater impact on memory for information. For sighted people, this may occur 
through the congruence of sound, image and information; for BPS people it may occur 
through the congruence of sound and information. 
It seems plausible that the use of congruent sound effects with AD could enhance 
memorability for information. However, it could also be expected that sighted 
participants would recall more than BPS participants with AD that has not been 
enriched. For sighted people, or people with partial sight, standard AD will include the 

135 
 
 
perceptual experience of seeing the stimuli, with the added advantage of the AD guiding 
attention to the semantic elements as they are verbalized, providing congruence of 
visual and semantic information. Research has suggested that both blind and sighted 
people can create mental representations based on language only (Eardley et al., 2016). 
However, when people with no residual vision listen to AD that presents language only, 
then there is no perceptual experience, and therefore there is not the same opportunity 
for benefits to memory. The lack of perceptual experience would mean that blind people 
are relying on imagery to support the semantic information provided by the AD, which 
increases the cognitive load of listening and remembering, without perceptual prompts 
to support this process. Sighted people, however, have the additional support of visual 
perception, which may mean better memory for non-enriched AD. 
Developing on Chapter 4, which demonstrated that ADGs increase memorability for 
sighted people, compared to SAGs, this study therefore seeks to explore the impact of 
AD with/without congruent sound effects (ADG, EDG) upon the experience, 
engagement and memorability of both blind and sighted people. It also investigates the 
ways in which the AD experience overall is received by both sighted and BPS 
participants, in the context of inclusive design.  
In summary, it is possible that BPS participants will present with lower recall overall at 
time B than sighted participants, due to potential differences in autobiographical 
memory retrieval between the two groups. Sighted participants may recall more with 
standard AD than BPS participants due to the benefits of ‘guided looking’. However, if 
vision is of primary importance to autobiographical memory, then sighted participants 
would recall more than BPS participants with both ADG and EDG.  However, the 
research literature on the impact of sound effects suggests that sound can increase 
attention, interest, mental imagery generation and emotion, all of which could 
contribute to enhanced memorability, in both blind and sighted participants. It is 
expected that sighted participants may recall more with ADG than BPS participants, due 
to the nature of ‘guided looking’. It is also expected that the use of sound in EDGs will 
impact positively upon the experience and engagement both groups. BPS participants 
can also be expected to recall more with EDG than ADG, due to the additional layer of 
perceptual experience. Sighted participants may also recall more with EDG than ADG, 
if the additional perceptual experience is able to increase imagery or increase 
attention/interest/emotion enough to enhance memorability.

Methods 
Design 
The study was a longitudinal mixed design. It had one between subjects IV: vision 
group (BPS, sighted). There were two repeated IVs: AD type (ADG, EDG) and time 
(time A - directly after the presentation; time B - one month later). A series of 
dependent variables were examined; the overall experience (enjoyment, engagement) 
was measured at times A and B, and memorability was measured at time B. Where data 
were not normally distributed, and normality could not be achieved using 
transformations, non-parametric tests were used. All tests were two-tailed. 
Participants 
Forty BPS people and forty sighted people took part in the study. One participant in the 
sighted group did not complete the follow up and was therefore excluded from the 
analysis. Within the BPS group, the mean (SD) age was 50.39 (15.04); 23 males, 17 
females. In the sighted group, the mean (SD) age was 50.64 (15.53); 22 males, 17 
females. Participants were matched for age within 5 years and an independent t test 
confirmed no difference in ages between BPS and sighted groups: (t=0.074, df=76, 
p=.94). Within the BPS group, 16 participants described themselves as having no 
useable vision, 22 as having some useable vision, and 2 as having considerable useable 
vision. An additional scale was selected which has been used to measure self-reported 
levels of functional vision (Douglas, Corcoran and Pavey, 2006; see also Fryer, 2013). 
Based on this scale, all 40 BPS participants would require assistance to access museum 
exhibits, which are often displayed from some distance. Five participants in the BPS 
group and three in the sighted group were non-native speakers of English; all eight 
described themselves as bi-lingual or fluent. The study received ethical approval from 
the University of Westminster’s Psychology Ethics Committee and was run in 
accordance with the British Psychological Society’s ethical requirements. All 
participants gave informed consent, and were debriefed upon completion. 
Materials  
Eight photos were selected from the Henry Grant Collection (see appendix 3.1).  Seven 
of these were used in the previous study, and one additional photo was selected for this 
study, which can be viewed with the accompanying AD text in appendix 4.1. The audio 

137 
 
 
descriptions used in the previous study were used (see appendix 3.2) and these provided 
the ADG condition. Enriched soundscapes were then created for the photos. The 
recorded audio descriptions were edited by the researcher using Audacity software 
(version 2.2.2) to apply sound effect files sourced via the National Theatre or via online 
resources such as the BBC Sound Effect archives (BBC, 2018). Where possible, sound 
was given a spatial element, such as footsteps walking from left to right. These enriched 
descriptions formed the EDG condition. The sound files were sent to experts for review 
(VocalEyes, Joselia Neves) and the final versions were produced to incorporate their 
feedback. The inclusion of sound effects added a mean time of 18.5 seconds to the total 
duration of the presentation of the photos compared to the previous study where only 
plain AD was presented.  
Measures 
Two questionnaires (time A, time B) were designed for the experiment; one 
administered in person after the participants had viewed the photos and the second 
completed online via a Qualtrics link, or by phone, one month later. The questionnaire 
at both time A and B (see appendices 4.2 and 4.3) addressed the participant’s experience 
and engagement levels, with the questionnaire at time B also addressing memorability 
for the photos.  
The questionnaires were an adapted version of those used in Study 3 (Chapter 4), with 
additional questions relating to the different stimuli (ADG, EDG) and questions specific 
to the BPS group. They collected the following information through a combination of 
quantitative and qualitative measures: 
Demographic data: the demographic data was the same as that collected in Study 3: 
age, gender, whether English was the first language. If English was not the first 
language, participants were asked to rate their level of English on a 5-point scale where 
1 was ‘beginner’ and 5 was ‘bilingual’. Participants were asked to rate their museum 
visiting habits over the last 5 years on a 5-point Likert Scale (1= never, 5= once a week 
or more).  
Vision Information: Participants were asked to confirm whether or not they had a visual 
impairment and if so, to state whether they considered themselves to have ‘no useable 
vision’, ‘some useable vision’ or ‘considerable useable vision.’ A second scale 
(Douglas, Corcoran and Pavey, 2006; see also Fryer, 2013) asked them to select the 

138 
 
 
most appropriate statement from a series, ranging from ‘I have no light perception’ to ‘I 
can recognise a friend by sight alone if I’m on the other side of the street.’ 
Experience and Engagement: The following measures remained the same as Study 3: 
desire to re-engage with the content, re-engagement at time B, thoughts and memories 
during the exhibition at time A, emotional response (yes/no), identification of emotions 
if relevant, generation of mental images and clarity of mental images if reported.  
Participants’ attention was measured by logging the time spent on each photo in 
seconds, and the time spent in seconds reviewing any photos, if they chose to do so. 
Participant were asked to rate their enjoyment of the experience on a 7-point Likert 
scale ranging from ‘hated it’ (1) to ‘loved it’ (7). 
Audio Evaluation: Participants firstly rated their experience of the audio at a general 
level using the same audio evaluation measure as Study 3. Participants were 
additionally asked whether they noticed the enrichment using sound effects in some of 
the photo presentations, and if they answered yes, they were asked to describe any 
impact it had on their experience in a free text response. They were then asked to state 
whether they preferred the ADG, the EDG, or whether it made no difference. If they 
stated a preference, they then rated their agreement with 10 statements about the audio 
on a 7-point Likert scale where 1 = ‘not at all true’, 4 = ‘somewhat true’ and 7 = ‘very 
true’. Participants with a preference for one type of audio were asked to rate this one 
specifically; participants who did not express a preference for an audio type were asked 
to rate the audio in general using the same scale. The ten statements addressed various 
aspects of the listening experience; ‘the audio was clear and easy to follow’, ‘it helped 
me to create an image in my mind of the photo’, ‘it brought the photo to life’, ‘it helped 
me to understand the layout of the photo’, ‘it gave me facts and context about the 
photos’, ‘it gave me what I need to discuss the exhibition with other visitors’, ‘it made 
me wonder or feel curious about the photos’, ‘ it made me want to discuss what the 
photos were about’, ‘I enjoyed listening to it’, and ‘it held my attention throughout.’ 
Memorability measures: At time B, participants were asked to recall the photos and 
provide as much detail about them as they could in free text responses. This photo recall 
text was then coded across several categories. Five of these were the same as categories 
used in Study 3: spatial, event/activity/movement, emotion and atmosphere (including 
non-visual imagery), participants’ reactions (emotions, thoughts, and memories 
mentioned during photo recall), and semantic recall (socio-historical 

139 
 
 
information/context and information about the photographer). Auditory imagery and 
references to sound was a separate category. The ‘visual’ category from Study 3 became 
‘content’, and included content elements that could be from seeing the photo or 
listening to the audio (e.g. one count attributed to ‘there was a boy’). The categories 
were combined as before to give each participant a score for the total details they 
recalled for both the ADG and EDG photos. 
Procedure 
All participants took part in the study in a quiet room with no external distraction. The 
eight photos, four of each photo type, ADG and EDG, were presented on a laptop 
computer in a PowerPoint presentation with a minimum screen of 13.5 inches. The 
order of both the photos and the photo type was randomised. Each photo was therefore 
presented with both EDG and ADG with the lowest percentage of EDG presentation for 
any individual photo being 41% and the highest 56%; the average percentage of EDG 
presentation for the photos was 50%. Participants listened to the audio through 
headphones after being invited to check the volume was comfortable. Participants were 
told that they could listen to the full duration of the audio file if they wanted to, or move 
on sooner if they chose, and that they would have a chance to re-visit any photos at the 
end if they wanted to. After the presentation of the photos participants completed the 
Time A questionnaire. This was done either online (Qualtrics) with the aid of a screen-
reader if necessary, via large-print questionnaire or via recorded dictation to the 
researcher, with the recordings later undergoing professional transcription. A month 
later, the time B questionnaire was either completed by phone, in which case calls were 
recorded and professionally transcribed, or online via Qualtrics. Upon completion, 
participants were debriefed, and sent a £15 shopping voucher as a thank you for their 
time. 
Results 
Participant demographics and time taken to follow up 
Participants were asked to what extent they enjoyed visiting museums and galleries. In 
the BPS group the median value was 4 (‘like it a lot’) with a range of 4. In the sighted 
group the median value was also 4 (range 2). A Mann-Whitney U test confirmed no 
difference between the groups: (U=664.50, N1 =40, N2= 35 p=.68).  

140 
 
 
Participants were asked how often they had visited museums in the last 5 years. In the 
BPS group, the median (range) response was 3 (4) and it was 3 (2) in the sighted group, 
with 3 indicating ‘about once every 6 months.’ A Mann-Whitney U test confirmed that 
sighted participants had visited more frequently in the last 5 years: (U=521.00 
N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.008). 
In the BPS group, the mean (SD) time taken in days to follow up was 35.78 (7.15). In 
the sighted group, it was 35.10 (5.21). A Mann-Whitney U test confirmed no significant 
difference between the two groups: (U=733, N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.64). 
Thirty-six of 40 BPS participants (90%) had used AD before, of which 28 had used AD 
in museums and galleries. Seventy-four per cent of the sighted group confirmed that 
they had heard of AD before. The median (range) frequency with which the sighted 
participants had used standard audio guides was 2.5 (4) (2=rarely, 3=sometimes). 
This study sought to explore a) the impact of EDG compared to ADG, for BPS and 
sighted participants, and b) the overall AD experience for BPS and sighted participants. 
The results are therefore divided into two sections. 
Comparison of the impact of ADG and EDG, for BPS and sighted 
participants 
Emotion and imagery 
To assess emotional responses and mental imagery generation, participants were first 
asked to select the photo that they found ‘most interesting’ and the photo that they 
found ‘least interesting.’ Some photos were selected more often than others, however 
each photo appeared in both the ‘most interesting’ and ‘least interesting’ categories. The 
split between original ADG and EDG presentation was broadly equal (see Procedure). 
Further analysis identified whether the choice of most and least interesting photos were 
originally presented with ADG or EDG:

Table 5.1: selection of most and least interesting photos: proportions with ADG and EDG, by 
participant group 
Table 5.1 suggests that both sighted, and to a greater degree, BPS participants were 
more likely to select an EDG photo as the one they found most interesting. BPS 
participants choice of ‘least interesting’ photo was more likely to have come from the 
ADG condition; for sighted participants the split looks more even. Binomial tests 
confirmed that more BPS participants chose an EDG than an ADG photo for the ‘most 
interesting photo’: EDG choice= 29, ADG choice=11, p=.006. For sighted participants, 
there was no difference: EDG choice=25, ADG choice =14, p=.108. For the choice of 
least interesting photo, there were no differences between the numbers of photos chosen 
with EDG or ADG for either BPS (p=.15) or sighted (p=.75). 
The emotional response was then analysed by stimulus type.

Table 5.2: number of participants who selected EDG or ADG for the most/least interesting 
photo, and percentage thereof who reported experiencing emotion  
Table 5.2 suggests that more BPS participants reported experiencing emotion in 
response to their ‘most interesting’ photo when this photo was presented with EDG 
compared to ADG. For sighted participants, the reverse appears to be the case. The 
proportions of participants reporting emotion for the most interesting photo appear 
similar for both BPS and sighted. For the least interesting photo, BPS participants 
appear to report emotion more than sighted participants. The distribution of counts in 
these categories were too low for inferential analysis. 
Participants were also asked whether they could form a mental image when thinking 
about these two photos, and if so, to rate its clarity from 1-10:

Results suggest that mental imagery generation was similar in clarity for both groups of 
participants (see Table 5.3).

Table 5.4: Audio preferences (percentages) by participant group (BPS, sighted) at times A and 
B 
The majority of participants preferred listening to the EDG audio at time A; and that 
audio preferences remained broadly consistent across both groups at time B (see Table 
5.4). A binomial test analysis was conducted for each sight group in order to explore 
whether there was a significant difference between the numbers of participants who 
preferred ADG or EDG. The participants who selected ‘it made no difference’ were 
omitted from this analysis, 3 BPS and 3 sighted participants at time A, and 1 BPS 
participant and 5 sighted at time B. The binomial analysis was significant at time A for 
both groups: BPS p=.001, sighted: p<.001 and at time B: BPS p=.003, sighted, p=.001. 
This indicates that significantly more participants in both the sighted and BPS groups 
preferred EDG. 
At time A, participants were also asked whether they noticed the sound effects, and if 
so, what the impact it had (if any) on their experience. All participants confirmed that 
they noticed it. The qualitative data provided on the impact of enrichment using sound 
effects was also analysed. Observations made by participants about the enrichment 
across all free text questions were coded thematically in order to explore the nature of 
the impact. In the BPS group, there were 94 positive observations, from 34 participants 
(85% of sample). There were 22 negative observations, from 10 participants (25%) and 
6 (15%) participants made a mixture of positive and negative observations. In the 
sighted group, there were 59 positive observations from 32 participants (82% of 
sample), and 8 negative observations from 8 participants (21%). 4 participants (10%) 

145 
 
 
made both positive and negative observations. A Pearson’s Chi-square test confirmed 
that there was no relationship between sight status and the numbers of positives 
comments (chi-square=11.54, p=.17). There was a relationship between sight status and 
the numbers of negative comments (chi-square= 11.61, p=.009), with more negative 
comments about the enrichment from BPS participants. Nevertheless, it is worth noting 
that there were similar numbers of people who made negative comments in both groups, 
and the difference seems to result from the fact that those who didn’t like the 
enrichment in the BPS group made more negative comments than did those in the 
sighted group.  
These observations were broken down further thematically to explore the content of 
what was said. Within the positive observations, the most important theme was that of 
the enrichment ‘making it more real.’ This included comments about the photos being 
brought to life by the enrichment, about the participant feeling present in the scene, or 
about the enrichment helping them to imagine it. Forty-three  such comments were 
made by 23 BPS participants (58% of sample), and 30 comments were made by 25 
sighted participants (64% of sample). Examples included: ‘it just transported me 
actually into the scene itself. It felt more realistic’ (BPS participant); ‘the background 
sounds made you feel as if you were right there with them’ (BPS participant); ‘The 
sound effects made the pictures come to life; made them seem more real.  I felt that I 
could almost imagine myself being there’ (sighted participant); ‘It positioned me in the 
photograph, giving each experience a sense of immediacy and urgency’ (sighted 
participant). 
The next most prevalent type of positive observation was that is enhanced the 
experience. Such observations were expressions of enjoyment and interest, including 
observations that the enrichment added atmosphere and helped tell the story. There were 
37 comments in this category from 24 BPS participants (60%), such as ‘it made it more 
interesting’ and ‘it made me smile’ and 21 comments from 17 sighted participants 
(44%); ‘it made it more lively’, and ‘each photo had a story to tell emphasized by the 
sounds’. 
Eight participants (4 in the BPS group (10%) and 4 (10%) in the sighted group) made 
the observation that the enrichment helped them to concentrate and helped to focus their 
attention, with two sighted participants stating that the sound effects highlighted aspects 
of the photos that they would otherwise have missed. Five BPS participants and 1 

146 
 
 
sighted participant commented that the enrichment either evoked memories or would 
help them to recall the photos later, and 7 participants (5 BPS, 2 sighted) likened the 
experience of listening to the EDG to cinema or film. 
The negative observations (from 10 BPS participants (25%) and 8 sighted participants 
(21%) were similar for both groups; namely that the enrichment was distracting, 
unnecessary or irritating if it did not match with the participants’ imagined versions of 
how the sounds should be. Seven BPS participants and 2 sighted participants suggested 
ways in which they would change the enrichment, such as shortening the duration of the 
sounds, ensuring they were used only during a pause in the words, or making them 
quieter. This analysis demonstrated a very similar, positive response to the use of 
enrichment with both BPS and sighted people, although the BPS participants recorded 
more thoughts overall than sighted. 
Autobiographical Memories 
One hundred and six autobiographical memories were recorded by participants in 
response to the free text question ‘During the exhibition, did any memories come to 
mind?’, of which 71 (67%) were from the BPS group and 35 (33%) from the sighted 
group. In the BPS group, the mean (SD) number of memories was 1.78 (1.25) and in the 
sighted group it was 0.90 (1.02). A Mann Whitney U test confirmed that there were 
significantly more memories in the BPS group: (U=441.50, N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.001). If 
participants reported memories, they were asked to rate the vividness of the most vivid 
memory. For BPS participants, the median (range) memory vividness rating was 9.5 (8); 
for sighted participants it was 8 (8). A Mann Whitney U test confirmed there the BPS 
group’s memory vividness was significantly greater than the sighted participants: 
(U=370, N1 =36, N2= 29, p=.04) 
In the BPS group, 38 memories related to EDG photos and 33 to plain photos. In the 
sighted group, 15 memories related to EDG photos and 20 to plain photos. Wilcoxon 
tests confirmed no difference in the numbers of memories generated in response to EDG 
and ADG photos for either group: for BPS (Z=-0.51, p=.61), for sighted (Z=-9.7, 
p=.33). In other words, BPS participants recorded more memories than sighted 
participants, but similar numbers of memories were evoked in response to both ADG 
and EDG photos in both groups. 
Memorability measures 

147 
 
 
At time B, BPS participants recalled a mean (SD) number of 2.08 (1.38) ADG photos, 
and 2.48 (1.22) EDG photos. Sighted participants recalled a mean (SD) number of 2.79 
(1.20) ADG photos, and 2.72 (1.19) EDG photos. Wilcoxon tests confirmed that more 
EDG photos were recalled than ADG photos in the BPS group: (Z= -2.15, p=.031) and 
that there was no difference between the amount of EDG and ADG photos recalled in 
the sighted group (Z= -0.323, p=.75). Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed that more ADG 
photos were recalled by sighted than BPS participants (U=548.50, N1 =40, N2= 39, 
p=.02) but that there was no difference in the number of EDG photos recalled in either 
group: (U=682.00, N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.32) 
The memories were coded for details, resulting in a total details score for ADG photos 
and a total details score for EDG photos, for each of the sighted and BPS groups. Some 
participants recalled a memory in only one condition, but not the other (see Table 5.5).

Table 5.5: recall of details for ADG or EDG only, and no recall of photos, by participant group 
The two participants in the sighted groups who did not recall any content about the 
photos were excluded from this analysis. Data of those who only remembered content 
from one condition were included in the analysis, but the result was that the data was 
not normally distributed, so nonparametric inference tests were used, with a Bonferroni-
Holm correction for multiple tests. In the BPS group, the mean (SD) total details scores 
were 24.65 (22.00) for ADG photos and 30.30 (26.50) for EDG photos. In the sighted 
group, the mean (SD) total details scores were 37.12 (30.38) for ADG photos and 37.92 
(31.64) for EDG photos. Wilcoxon tests confirmed no differences in the amount of 
details recalled for ADG or EDG photos either in the BPS group: (Z=1.68, p=.19); or in 
the sighted group: (Z=0.369, p=.71).Therefore, participants in both groups recalled 
similar numbers of details for photos regardless of the AD type. Mann-Whitney U tests 

148 
 
 
were also conducted to explore potential differences in recall of the details between 
groups. The difference between the sighted and BPS groups for the amount of details 
recalled for ADG photos did not quite reach the threshold for statistical significance 
(U=541, N1 =40, N2= 37, p=.084). There was no difference between the sighted and BPS 
groups in terms of the amount of details recalled for EDG photos (U=617, 
N1 =40, N2= 37, p=.21). Therefore, blind and sighted participants recalled similar 
numbers of details about ADG and EDG photos, but there was a potential trend towards 
sighted people recalling more details about ADG photos than BPS participants. 
Finally, participants’ recall of the photos were scored for detail types.  
 
Figure 5.1: mean detail counts for categories: content, event/activity/movement, spatial, 
reactions (participants’ thoughts, emotions and memories), semantic information (socio-
historical details and details about the photographer), emotion and atmosphere (including non 
visual imagery) and sound (references to sound and sound images) by participant group and 
stimuli type (ADG, EDG), at time B 
Figure 5.1 shows that content elements were the most salient category recalled for both 
BPS and sighted participants. BPS participants appear to have higher mean counts of 
personal reactions compared to sighted participants. The amount and distribution of data 
points within the categories did not permit inferential analysis.

The overall AD experience: levels of engagement of BPS and sighted 
participants  
Attention 
The total presentation time for the 8 photos varied for each participant depending on the 
randomly allocated combination of ADG and EDG files that they received, although 
this was only minimally different (see Materials, p.126). In the BPS group, the mean 
(SD) total photo presentation time was 30 minutes and 51 seconds (3.81 seconds). In the 
sighted group, it was 30 minutes and 52 seconds (5.20 seconds). A Mann-Whitney U 
test confirmed there was no difference in the total presentation time for BPS or sighted: 
(U=665, N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.26). Each participant’s time with the photos was calculated 
as a percentage of the total audio time available to them. The mean (SD) percentage of 
available time spent listening was 99.34 (11.97) for the BPS group, and 94.81 (15.47) 
for the sighted group. Some participants spent more than 100% of the total audio time, 
due to them choosing to reflect on the photo before moving on. Analysis was therefore 
conducted on the number of participants who chose to listen for less than the total 
available audio time. 19% of BPS participants listened for less than the total available 
time, and 34% of sighted participants. A Pearson chi square analysis confirmed no 
differences between the two groups: (chi-square=2.19, p=.14).

Table 5.6: enjoyment ratings (median, range) at times A and B, where the maximum score is 7 
Table 5.6 indicates that enjoyment in both groups was high at time A, with BPS 
participants appearing to rate their enjoyment slightly more positively than the sighted 
participants, where there was also more variability. A Mann-Whitney U test confirmed 
this difference was significant: (U=544, N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.009). Over time, enjoyment 

150 
 
 
ratings for sighted people appeared to remain stable at time B. Enjoyment ratings 
appeared to reduce for BPS participants, one month later. Wilcoxon tests confirmed that 
there was no difference between times A and B for sighted participants: (Z=1.70, p=.09) 
but there was a significant difference between times A and B for BPS participants: (Z=-
2.50, p=.012). However, the rating of how enjoyable the exhibition had been was still 
high at Time B, with the median rating of 6 indicating ‘liked it a lot’. A Mann-Whitney 
U test confirmed no difference between BPS and sighted groups in enjoyment scores at 
time B with the test not reaching the convention for statistical significance: (U=583.50, 
N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.063.)

Table 5.7: Likely re-engagement scores at times A and B (median, range) for BPS and sighted 
participant groups, where maximum score=5 (definitely). 
Table 5.7 shows that likely re-engagement scores were at the maximum level for both 
participant groups at time A. There was no difference between the likely reengagement 
scores between BPS and sighted people at Time A:(U=718.50, N1=40, N2=40, p=.37). 
At time B, the desire to explore more photos remained at the maximum level for BPS 
participants (definitely). It reduced to ‘probably’ amongst sighted people, with a 
Wilcoxon test showing that the difference between times A and B for sighted people 
was close to significance: (Z=-1.94, p=.052). However, a Mann-Whitney U test 
confirmed no differences between BPS and sighted groups in likely reengagement 
scores at time B: (U=604.00 N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.086). 
At follow up, participants were asked whether they had thought about the photos or 
talked to anyone about them since, if they had tried to find out any further information, 
or engaged further with the museum. In the BPS group, 88% gave a positive response to 
this question, compared to 67% in the sighted group. A Pearson’s chi-sq test confirmed 

151 
 
 
that there was a relationship between participant group and follow-up engagement: (chi 
sq (1, N=79) = 4.87, p=.027). For the 61 participants who reported follow up

Two blind participants also left an additional comment that they had discussed with 
others how the exhibition had been able to create images in their minds. 

152 
 
 
Table 5.8 suggests that conversations followed by thoughts were the most prevalent 
form of follow-up engagement in both groups, followed by content engagement and 
engagement with the museum. The distribution of counts in these categories did not 
allow for further analysis. 
Thoughts  
Participants were asked what they were thinking about during the exhibition and their 
thoughts were coded thematically. BPS participants recorded a mean (SD) number of 
3.53 (3.43) thoughts; sighted participants recorded a mean (SD) number of 2.15 (1.16) 
thoughts. A Mann-Whitney U test confirmed there were significantly more thoughts in 
the BPS group: (U=535.00, N1 =40, N2= 39, p=.014).  
Many of the participants’ thoughts were related to the content or subject matter. 
Seventeen comments were made by 14 BPS participants (35% of sample) and 9 
comments from 8 sighted participants (21% of sample) about the photos themselves, 
either content within them, or the fact that they were concentrating on them. Other 
comments related to the photos were about imagining oneself in the picture, or about the 
atmosphere of the photo; for example, ‘I was mainly trying to just think about the 
pictures that I was seeing and also trying to imagine myself in those situations.’ (sighted 
participant) and ‘it was being brought to life in my mind, the scene, not just the photo 
but the whole scene and the area’ (BPS participant). Such comments were more 
prevalent in the BPS group (16 comments from 13 participants, 33% of sample) than in 
the sighted group (5 comments from 5 participants, 13%), partly due to the fact that 
BPS participants also referred to actively building mental images whilst listening. Such 
mental impressions were also created in multiple modalities, for example: ‘the eels, 
yeah, you get the impression of the smell, the taste, the whole environment’ (BPS 
participant). There were similar numbers of thoughts in each participant group about the 
photographer, about London, and about life in the past. 
Participants also thought about the interpretation, and these thoughts were more 
prevalent in the BPS group. Twenty-two comments were made by 17 BPS participants 
(43%) about the description. Most of these comments referred to participants’ 
enjoyment of the description or feeling of being immersed in it; one person found the 
factual information too long, and two participants commented on the story-telling nature 
of the AD. In the sighted group, 17 comments were made by 13 people (33%). Three 
participants found the description too long or too detailed, and the rest of the comments 

153 
 
 
were positive observations, with several people highlighting the fact that it drew their 
attention to things they would otherwise have missed or otherwise enhanced the 
experience; ‘Interesting that the description took my attention around the photographs to 
things that I wouldn't necessarily have noticed without it’; ‘Taking the time to listen to a 
guided description of each image triggered imagination in an unexpectedly powerful 
way.’ Three sighted participants (8%) thought about the use of sound effects, compared 
to 13 participants (33%) in the BPS group.  
Finally, participants reported thoughts that were a personal response to the exhibition, 
such as memories (12 participants (30%) from each group) and reactions, including 
expressions of interest or emotion (13 BPS participants (33%) and 5 sighted participants 
(13%). Overall, the thoughts recorded were broadly similar in content although the BPS 
group reported larger numbers of thoughts and observations. 
Audio Evaluation 
At time A, participants gave ratings for four aspects of the overall audio experience 
(measured using a 10-point Likert scale). These were totalled to create an audio 
evaluation measure, which had a Cronbach’s alpha of .82, indicating high internal 
consistency. In the BPS group, mean (SD) audio evaluation score was 36.35 (4.09) and 
in the sighted group it was 32.87 (4.74); the maximum score was 40. A Mann-Whitney 
U test was performed on the total audio evaluation score, which confirmed that the BPS 
rated the audio overall more highly than the sighted group: (U=421.00, N1 =40, N2= 39, 
p<.001).  
Discussion 
This study extended the findings of Chapter 4, and the broader AD literature, by 
exploring the impact of enriched AD with both BPS and sighted people. The study’s 
findings enable firstly a comparison of the impact of EDG and ADG on the experience, 
engagement and memorability of BPS and sighted people, and secondly, a comparison 
of the overall AD experience for the two groups. 

154 
 
 
The impact of EDG and ADG on BPS and sighted listeners: experience 
and engagement 
Firstly, the EDG was well received by both groups of participants, with significantly 
more listeners preferring the enriched AD, regardless of their level of vision. This 
preference in both BPS and sighted people is consistent with observations in the 
research literature that sounds in audio guides can increase enjoyment (Ardito, 
Costabile, De Angeli, & Lanzilotti, 2012; Bertens & Polak, 2019). The preference for 
EDG also emerged through the selection of the ‘most interesting photo’; which, within 
the BPS group, was significantly more likely to have been presented with EDG. It 
seems reasonable to suggest that the layer of perception provided through sound 
contributed to the level of interest for BPS people. It may also have contributed to the 
level of emotion in this group, as BPS participants appeared more likely to report an 
emotional response to their choice of ‘most interesting’ photo, if it was one originally 
presented with EDG. This finding provides tentative support to the observations in the 
museum literature about sound increasing emotion (Bertens & Polak, 2019; De Jong, 
2018; Fahlenbrach, 2008; Marshall et al., 2016), although in the current study the 
tendency for EDG to enhance emotion is indicated in the blind but not in the sighted 
group. It is possible that the use of sound had more emotional impact for the BPS 
participants as it provided them with a direct perceptual experience of the photos, not 
available through ADG alone, and as such, may have had more salience. However, this 
finding remains tentative as it could not be supported by inferential analysis. 
The breakdown of comments about the sound enrichment was also broadly similar 
between groups, with the most common theme being that the enrichment helped to 
bring the photo to life or increased the sense of being present in the scene. This differs 
from the findings in audio drama (Fryer et al., 2013) and whilst the observations are 
qualitative in nature, they would merit further exploration. The prevalence and content 
of comments about negative aspects of the sounds were also similar between groups, 
namely that the sounds were distracting or unnecessary, although the prevalence of 
negative comments was relatively low. This serves to re-emphasise the importance of 
choice of mode of delivery in museum interpretation, and in audio in particular 
(Woodruff et al., 2001), so that visitors can select interpretation that fits their own 
preferences. 

155 
 
 
Whilst the qualitative comments suggested that the sounds were able to enhance 
imaginative engagement, the sound enrichment did not appear to contribute any 
particular advantage to the generation of mental images as evaluated through the mental 
image clarity ratings. Both ADG and EDG were successful in stimulating the creation 
of mental images for both groups of participants, and the clarity ratings were similarly 
high in both groups. It may have been expected that the sounds would increase mental 
imagery generation and clarity, especially for the BPS participants, where the sounds 
were a source of perceptual experience relating to the photos. However, it is possible 
that the language of the AD alone was sufficient to allow the formation of images. This 
is an important finding for AD practice, as it suggests that that the AD was able to 
engage the BPS participants’ imagination in a way that gave them a sense of the photo, 
and with similar self-reported levels of clarity to people with sight.  
Whilst it must be recognised that not all BPS people will want to create mental images 
(Chapter 2), and indeed that imagery capabilities are subject to individual differences 
(Isaac & Marks, 1994), it remains an important aspect of evaluation for AD. Firstly, 
because many BPS people will wish to form a mental image of the object or artwork, as 
reported by the majority of practitioners in AD traditions and across AD types 
(Giansante, 2013; RNIB, 2010; Synder, 2014) . This may be because the majority of 
blind people have some visual experience to draw upon, as sight loss often affects 
people in later life (RNIB, 2018). Secondly, because the formation of mental imagery is 
likely to enhance recall (for example, Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). Generation of 
mental imagery is therefore a possible predictor that a lasting memory may be formed of 
the exhibits, which may in turn indicate increased impact. Furthermore, research has 
demonstrated that BPS people are able to create a spatial mental representation through 
language alone (Eardley, Edwards, Malouin, & Kennedy, 2016). The similarly high 
imagery ratings in both groups reported here may provide further tentative support for 
this, as they suggest that BPS participants’ ability to create a mental representation was 
not compromised by reduced or absent vision. It is also possible that the inability of 
sound to increase the clarity of mental images even further may have been a reflection 
of the fact that the median clarity ratings were already high (8/10). 
The majority of participants in both groups also experienced autobiographical memories 
being evoked in response to the photos. However, EDG was no more likely than ADG 
to generate autobiographical memories in BPS or sighted participants. This again 
suggests that the sounds contained in EDG did not offer any specific advantages in 

156 
 
 
terms of cueing memories, perhaps because the impact of the photo content and the 
audio commentary was already high in terms of memory cueing, with 82% of the 
sample recording memories.  
In summary, the EDG did not appear to offer any clear-cut advantages in evocation of 
autobiographical memories and mental image generation/clarity. However, this should 
be contextualised by the fact that EDG was preferred by both groups of participants and 
that the qualitative data demonstrated its potential to enhance imaginative engagement. 
Selection of the ‘most interesting’ photo suggests that the preference for EDG was even 
higher amongst BPS than sighted participants. EDG appears therefore to offer 
advantages in terms of the experience for all participants. 
The impact of EDG and ADG on BPS and sighted listeners: memorability 
The memorability measures in this study revealed that the impact of photos presented 
with EDG and ADG did indeed differ. The key finding of the study was that the EDG 
stimuli were able to increase memorability for BPS people, compared to ADG photos.  
Furthermore, this effect on memorability for BPS participants meant that there was no 
difference between the BPS and sighted groups in the number of photos recalled with 
EDG, or the richness of EDG memories. In other words, if there is a tendency for BPS 
participants to recall fewer memories than sighted people (see also Eardley & Pring, 
2006; Tekcan et al., 2015), then the use of EDG was able to negate this tendency. 
However, it should be recognised that this study did not ask participants for memories 
of the experience of the photo presentation, but rather they were asked for memories of 
the photos themselves, which may have been episodic components of the overall 
memory of the event of participating in the study. Comparisons with the 
autobiographical memory literature are therefore necessarily tentative.  
Regardless of the type of memory representation that was created by the participant, the 
use of recall in this study was consistent with understandings of everyday memory 
whereby learning is incidental and aspects of everyday memory (such as memory for 
places, faces, objects and actions) are components with a broader framework of personal 
history (Cohen & Conway, 2007). Nonetheless, recall was increased for BPS people 
with EDG and it seems likely that there are multiple explanations for this, which are not 
mutually exclusive. 

157 
 
 
Firstly, it is possible that the additional layer of perceptual experience provided by the 
sounds supported mental image generation, as suggested by the qualitative analysis of 
BPS participants’ thoughts on the experience generally and the sound in particular, 
where comments strongly suggested that it helped with imaginative engagement. 
Secondly, it is possible that the sound increased interest and emotion, all of which are 
associated with enhanced recall (Holland & Kensinger, 2010; Renninger & Hidi, 2015). 
Increased interest for EDG was apparent for both BPS and sighted participants through 
the preference for EDG over ADG. It was also apparent in the BPS group through the 
choice of ‘most interesting’ photo, which was more likely to be chosen with EDG. The 
BPS data also suggest that emotional responses to the ‘most interesting’ photo were 
more likely if it was presented with EDG. Although the effects of ADG and EDG 
cannot be entirely dissociated in this research because of the repeated measures design, 
the data suggest that EDG was enjoyed more than ADG amongst the BPS group. This is 
also consistent with qualitative observations and discussion in the museum literature 
about the benefits of sound (for sighted visitors) (Bertens & Polak, 2019; Bubaris, 2014; 
Marshall et al., 2016).  
It was anticipated that these advantages of sound could aid memorability in both groups, 
however there were no differences between the numbers of photos recalled with EDG 
and ADG in the sighted group. It is possible that the visual experience, and the guided 
looking through AD, was enough for the sighted participants to form sufficient 
connections at encoding, and that the effect of any additional perceptual experience 
above and beyond that would be of lesser importance. However further research would 
be needed to explore this tentative suggestion.  
Finally, sighted participants recalled more ADG photos than BPS participants did, and 
with a potential trend towards a higher amount of details. It is likely that the congruent 
nature of the ’guided looking’ was able to create a perceptual experience that brought 
together visual elements of the photos with semantic content. Furthermore, there was 
the potential for this experience to be enriched further with multisensory imagery 
through the language of the AD. For BPS participants, there was no direct link between 
perceptual experience and semantic content when the sounds were absent. Furthermore, 
mental imagery generated through language may be ‘weaker’ than imagery generated 
through perceptual experience (Bolls & Lang, 2003; Rodero, 2012; but see Fryer, 
2013). Therefore, these findings were consistent with the prediction that sighted 
participants would recall more than BPS with ADG. 

158 
 
 
The overall AD experience for BPS and sighted participants: 
Some of the experience and engagement measures used in this study do not dissociate 
between the effects of ADG and EDG bur rather provide insight into the similarities and 
differences between BPS and sighted participants in terms of the overall experience of 
presenting photos with AD. As such, these measures are crucial to the investigation of 
AD as a tool for inclusive design within museums and interpretation in a museum 
context.  
There were a number of similarities in the experience and engagement of BPS and 
sighted participants. The experience was well received by both groups of participants 
and engagement levels were similar. This was demonstrated by high enjoyment levels in 
both groups, with median ratings of at least 6 (‘I liked it a lot’). Levels of interest were 
also high, as demonstrated by participants’ indication that they would be keen to 
explore more of the museum’s photography collections (median ratings indicating 
‘probably’ to ‘definitely’).   This is also consistent with the findings presented in the 
chapter 4, and provides further evidence that AD, enriched or otherwise, is well 
tolerated and enjoyed by people with vision as well as by people who rely on it for 
access.  
Qualitative analysis of participants’ thoughts showed that they were all concentrating on 
the task, and that the photo presentation was able to generate thoughts that suggested 
participants were making personal connections to the stimuli. These included 
expressions of interest, emotion, and personal memories. There were also thoughts that 
were an extension of the semantic information presented, such as reflections on the city 
of London today and in the past, and thoughts about the photographer and his work. 
Thus, the analysis of thoughts indicated positive levels of interest and engagement.  
The importance of personal context and identity in meaning-making in museums has 
been widely discussed in the research literature (Dierking & Falk, 1992; Falk, 2006, 
2013; Paris & Mercer, 2011). Paris & Mercer (2011) contend that museum visitors 
search for features of their personal lives during their exploration of museums, and that 
this feeds back into their understanding of their own identity. As demonstrated in 
Chapter 4, the current findings suggest that the audio interpretation provided 
participants with the support they needed to engage with the photos, consider their 
possible meaning, and relate this to their own lived experience.  

159 
 
 
Furthermore, the memorability analysis for both groups shows that the content of the 
photo memories was broadly similar between groups. As in Chapter 4, the content 
elements (e.g. ‘there was a boy’) were the most salient, and the other categories were 
similar in prevalence. The presence of participants’ emotional and cognitive reactions, 
semantic recall, and details indicating imaginative enragement such as ‘emotion and 
atmosphere’ were all present in this study as they were in Chapter 4, suggesting once 
again that the AD experience was able to facilitate a rich and engaging experience. 
Some differences between the BPS and sighted groups suggest that whilst engagement 
was high overall, it was higher still amongst BPS participants. Although the audio 
evaluation measures showed positive responses in both the BPS and sighted groups, 
they were significantly higher in the former, with BPS participants providing a more 
positive overall evaluation of the audio. Other qualitative measures suggested that BPS 
participants were more engaged with the experience than the sighted participants. As 
discussed above, one way of exploring levels of interest and the formation of personal 
connections was through evaluation of participants’ thoughts and memories. These 
showed a high level of engagement for both groups, but the BPS group generated more 
memories and thoughts compared to the sighted group, suggesting higher engagement. 
They also rated the vividness of their memories more highly than the sighted group.  
The nature of the thoughts was also slightly different. BPS participants appeared more 
likely to report placing themselves imaginatively in the scene of the photo (33% of BPS 
sample and 13% of sighted sample). For many, this related to the conscious process of 
building a mental image, which the sighted participants did not have the same need to 
do. They were also more likely to reflect on the interpretation, and the use of sound, 
perhaps because both were entirely central to their experience of the photos, as opposed 
to one part of the perceptual experience, as was the case for sighted people. 
It seems reasonable to suggest that BPS people were more stimulated by the AD 
experience, because the AD was their experience to a greater or lesser extent, depending 
on an individual’s level of sight. However, it is also possible that methodological issues 
influenced the higher number of thoughts and memories in BPS people. Whereas the 
sighted participants typed their answers into an online questionnaire, 93% of BPS 
participants chose to dictate their responses to the researcher. Whilst every care was 
taken to ensure this still operated as the recording of an answer, rather than as a 
conversation, it is still possible that BPS participants provided more information simply 

160 
 
 
because it is faster and easier to speak than to type. Further research, ideally using 
dictation for all participants, would be needed to explore this potential difference in the 
thoughts and memories stimulated by AD for BPS people, compared to sighted.  
It would be useful to develop further AD reception studies to try to determine whether 
attention and engagement is sustained for longer amongst BPS people compared to 
sighted. Further work could also use measures of presence to further investigate whether 
BPS people are more ‘immersed’ whilst listening to AD. 
There were also differences between subsequent re-engagement between times A and B. 
Levels of re-engagement were high overall in this study, with 67% of sighted 
participants choosing to re-engage with the experience either in their thoughts, 
conversations or subsequent explorations of the subject matter and museum. This is 
comparable to 60% of the sighted ADG group who chose to re-engage in Chapter 4. In 
the current study, this figure rose to 88% amongst BPS participants, with conversations 
being the most common form of re-engagement (all participants), closely followed by 
thoughts about the photos and guides. Sufficient interest was triggered for BPS 
participants to research the subject matter further online, or to engage further with the 
museum (23 and 11% respectively). However, it was striking that all 35 BPS 
participants who confirmed subsequent re-engagement stated that they discussed the 
experience with someone else between times A and B. This figure may be elevated to 
some degree by the fact that some BPS participants had a travel companion with them, 
and so it would be very natural to discuss the experience on the return journey. 
However, many did not, but were sufficiently interested to want to subsequently discuss 
the photos or audio guides in their social circles. This finding is again consistent with 
Study 4 and is suggestive of the importance of social function and conversations in 
cultural experience as discussed in Chapter 3. It is also consistent with the museum 
literature which emphasises the importance of social aspects of museum visiting 
(Dierking & Falk, 1992), and observations in focus groups held with BPS museum 
visitors about the importance of post visit reminiscing and conversations (Reich et al., 
2011).  
Finally, it should be recognised that the BPS participants did not form a homogeneous 
group, but that the spectrum of sight loss was wide, ranging from 3 congenitally blind 
participants, to people who had access to a life-time of visual memory following recent 
sight loss in their sixties. However, the common factor, and justification for grouping 

161 
 
 
them together, was that all BPS participants had sufficient visual impairment that they 
would not be able to access collections in a museum without AD. The heterogeneity of 
the BPS group means that they are representative of BPS audiences for museums, but it 
is possible that the heterogeneity makes it harder to find an effect of EDG. This may 
therefore suggest that if the study had focused on people with very little vision or visual 
experience, then the effects may have been even stronger. The differences found in this 
study could be of even greater importance when considering the museum access needs 
of people with very little vision or visual experience. 
Summary  
This study was the first empirical exploration of the use of congruent sound effects in 
AD in both blind and sighted people. The findings demonstrate that EDG was preferred 
by both groups of participants. The qualitative data and choice of ‘most interesting’ 
photo suggest particularly high levels of engagement amongst BPS people for the EDG. 
Furthermore, the memorability benefits of EDG meant that the photos presented with 
EDG were as memorable for the BPS group as they were for the sighted participants. It 
has been suggested that the purpose of AD is to offer parity of experience for BPS 
people, compared to sighted visitors (Chapter 2). The current findings, which suggest 
equal, if not greater, levels of enjoyment, interest, attention, mental image generation 
and engagement in BPS participants, suggest that this can certainly be achieved. EDGs 
are therefore a valid choice for museums to explore when they are considering how to 
make their narratives accessible and engaging through inclusive design and EDGs have 
promising potential as inclusive museum interpretation. These results indicate that 
offering AD that is enriched with congruent sounds would be a valid and valuable 
choice for museums to make. In so doing, they would increase their access provision 
and enhance their interpretation for many users beyond the access audience. 
Furthermore, they would facilitate more shared experiences.

Chapter 6: Revisiting inclusive experiences facilitated 
through Audio Description 
Introduction 
This research started with the premise that many museum visitors need support in order 
to access an engaging and memorable experience, regardless of their level of vision. It 
therefore sought to explore the central question: how might AD support access to an 
engaging museum experience for visitors with and without sight? The approach to this 
question was framed by a broad understanding of access. The concept of access was not 
limited to physical access to the museum’s collections, whereby their physical 
appearance and visual features are addressed. Rather, access was understood as access 
to an engaging museum experience, that may have a long-term impact on the individual, 
as demonstrated by aspects of emotional and/or cognitive engagement. Museum 
interpretation provides support for visitors which may help them to engage. The 
objective of the thesis was to explore ways in which AD, as a potentially inclusive form 
of museum interpretation, might help museums to enhance access for both blind and 
sighted users, also facilitating shared experiences. 
In asking the question ‘how might AD support access to an engaging museum 
experience for visitors with and without sight?’, the research addressed several 
elements, which were split out and explored in the experimental chapters 2-5. Any 
question about museum AD needs to begin with an exploration about what form(s) 
museum AD takes and what its purpose is thought to be. This is crucial, as museum AD 
is an under researched segment of AD practice and research.  
In thinking about the purpose of museum AD, it is essential to understand the 
experience it is seeking to translate.  The impact of the museum experience, and how to 
evaluate it, was explored through analysis of museum memories using an 
autobiographical coding model. This developed a method of evaluation for museums 
that informs on the nature of their impact, and simultaneously contributes to 
understanding in psychology about memories for cultural events. 
The nature of engagement in an experience of exploring museum artworks was 
considered through evaluating participants’ levels of engagement immediately after 
experiencing a photo presentation and the impact one month later. Measures of 

163 
 
 
attention, enjoyment, emotional response, interest, and memorability were used.  The 
research addressed the use of AD by sighted people by comparing it to a standard audio 
guide or minimal text interpretation. This was the first study to explore the impact of 
museum AD on sighted users. The final study built on these findings by a) exploring the 
impact of enhancing the AD experience through perceptual enrichment, and b) adding 
to the findings about AD’s potential as inclusive design by evaluating the experience 
with both blind and sighted participants. This study was also the first evaluation of the 
impact of sound enriched AD with both blind and sighted users. 
The findings of experimental chapters 2-5 now allow us to revisit the central question. 
In so doing, this chapter will draw conclusions based on how the research findings have 
developed understanding of AD and its purpose in museums; the nature of the museum 
experience and the ways in which it can be evaluated, and how AD can help to facilitate 
an engaging and inclusive experience. The chapter then discusses implications for 
practice and avenues for future research. Finally, it revisits the concept of museum AD 
in the light of the research findings, and discusses the future of the discipline. The 
chapter concludes with a summary of the contribution of this research to the fields of 
AVT, psychology and museum studies.  
Discussion of the research findings 
The purpose of museum AD 
 
In its ‘home discipline’ of Translation Studies, AD is defined as a form of intersemiotic 
translation, which takes a nonverbal visual source text and translates it into a target text 
of spoken language (Jiménez Hurtado & Soler Gallego, 2015, see Chapter 1). When 
understood as such, in the museum context, it primarily addresses physical access to 
collections (to the visual information). Chapter 2 developed understanding of museum 
AD by examining the current museum AD guidelines, and exploring practitioners’ 
views about the optimal content, style, and purpose of AD in museums (Study 1).   
Responses from two important AD traditions, US and Europe, were compared, 
revealing many points of agreement but some important differences. Describers from 
both regions tended to agree on important aspects of AD content, such as the use of 
multisensory imagery, referring to colour, and seeking to generate mental images. 
However, European describers gave more importance to factors such as addressing 

164 
 
 
meaning or creating emotion in museum AD, thereby indicating that a certain level of 
subjective interpretation can be acceptable or even desirable. They also placed more 
emphasis on using cognitive prompts, with the aim of leaving the listener with 
something to think about or remember. US practitioners were more likely to view 
cognitive prompts as outside the remit of museum AD, and overall US practitioners 
favoured an approach that reduced subjectivity as far as possible. The spectrum of 
opinion demonstrated in this research is also reflected in the (so far) limited museum 
AD guidelines (see Chapter 2). 
These results therefore opened debates about the kind of experience that museum AD is 
seeking to provide: whether it should address the ‘translation’ of visual information 
only, or whether it should expand its remit to address meaning and emotion. The 
findings emphasised that AD could aim to do many things in a museum: provide visual 
information, help listeners to build mental images, tell stories, provide background 
information, explore meaning and arouse emotion in the listener. The differing views on 
which of these aspects it could and should address raised the question of what the 
purpose of museum AD should be, and to what extent the describer should be explicit 
about their own role in the process of creating and delivering AD. 
These debates were then discussed in the context of theory from Translation Studies, 
whereby the principle of objectivity in translation more broadly is critically examined 
and recognition of the visibility of the translator is called for (Chesterman, 1997; Van 
Wyke, 2010, Venuti, 1995). It is likely that the differences in opinion between US and 
European describers are underpinned by the pervading emphasis given to the objectivity 
principle in the wider discipline of AD, particularly in the US, where principles of 
objectivity are advocated through the WYSIWYS maxim (Mazur & Chmiel, 2012) 
(Chapter 2). This thesis calls for a critical evaluation of the objectivity principle in the 
context of museum AD. It argues that a broader understanding of museum ‘access’, 
meaning access that goes beyond physical and sensory access to include access to an 
engaging experience, necessitates a different understanding of museum AD and its 
function. The empirical findings from Study 1 – the differences in opinions between 
regions (US, Europe) – are what suggest a need for a broader discussion about AD and 
its function.  
These findings add weight to observations in the research literature. In his exploration 
of the experiences of blind visitors in art museums, Simon Hayhoe contends that 

165 
 
 
learning about the visual arts is based on more than perception alone, emphasising the 
importance of language, emotional attachment and personal identity. He argues for the 
re-evaluation of artworks as ‘objects with merely perceptual value’, and museums as 
‘institutions that hold little value beyond their contents’ (Hayhoe, 2017, p.23). The 
findings of this thesis logically suggest a re-evaluation of the ‘source text’ in museum 
AD (chapter 2). If the ‘source text’ is deemed to extend beyond the visual appearance of 
exhibits, and to encompass the broader museum visiting experience, then understanding 
the nature of that experience and relating it to AD becomes crucial. Exploring the nature 
of the museum experience and optimal ways to evaluate its impact was addressed in 
Study 2 (Chapter 3). 
The long-term impact of the museum experience and approaches to 
evaluation 
Museums have developed their thinking about their role in society in recent decades. 
Whereas they were once viewed as formal, academic and highbrow institutions where 
visitors came to learn, or have a reverent cultural experience, in both practice and 
research the emphasis is now on the experiential nature of museums (Prior, 2003). 
Museums operate in an experience economy (Pine & Gilmore, 2011, Radder & Han, 
2015) and there has been much focus in the museum research literature on 
understanding audiences, including the reasons why people visit museums (Pekarik et 
al.,, 1999; Prentice, 2001; Radder & Han, 2015; Roppola, 2012; Slater, 2007). However, 
relatively little is understood about the cognitive experiences that visitors have once at 
the museum, and how this relates to the long-term impact of that experience. 
Research has explored the application of memorability as a way of evaluating the 
experience (Anderson, 2003; Anderson & Shimizu, 2007; Falk & Dierking, 1990, 1997; 
Medved et al., 2004; Medved & Oatley, 2000). However, researchers recognize that 
early museum memories studies were atheoretical, and that the methodologies of 
museum memory studies have since varied according to individual research questions 
(Anderson et al, 2007). There is therefore no broad agreement regarding the key 
measures that could guide museum memory research, and new research strategies need 
to be developed in order to understand the long-term impact of visits (Anderson et al, 
2007). Thus, up to now there has not been a method of evaluation that has applied 
inferential analysis to a fuller breadth of measures that can be drawn from the 
autobiographical memory theory and literature. This has limited the possibility of 

166 
 
 
reaching generalisable conclusions about the impact that museums have on their 
visitors. This is the gap that this research sought to address, on the basis that such a 
technique a) provides a ‘common ground’ in understanding the apparently diverse 
experiences that people may have in museums and b) allows for the generalisation from 
samples to wider populations.  
The research findings presented a hierarchy of content that was remarkably similar 
across the sample, regardless of participants’ age or the frequency with which they visit 
museums, thus demonstrating that our cognitive experiences of museums are broadly 
similar, no matter who we are as individuals or what our reason for visiting may be.  
The minor differences that were identified between older and younger participants could 
be explained by differences in autobiographical memory that occur through aging. The 
consistency within this hierarchy of content therefore enables us to develop our 
understanding of the impressions museums leave on visitors.  
This approach starts to respond to the issue raised by researchers regarding the 
challenge of expanding the unit of analysis beyond individuals (Anderson et al., 2007). 
The complexity of human experiences has been regarded as a challenge to museum 
memory research (Anderson et al., 2007), and it has been suggested that it is difficult to 
evaluate the highly individual and complex nature of visits in ways that are robust 
(Anderson et al., 2007). However, this research contends and demonstrates that whilst 
there is of course variability in individual experiences, the commonalities in people’s 
cognitive experiences within the museum mean that autobiographical memory theory-
driven research can facilitate exploration of patterns of commonalities and differences 
in populations. In that sense, the current paradigm does enable generalisation about 
impact: something previously considered problematic in the literature (Anderson et al., 
2007). This provides an important contribution to the museum memory literature which 
is calling for new and generalisable methods (Anderson et al., 2007). 
The breakdown of the hierarchy of content in this research gives us crucial 
understanding about the lasting memories, or impact, that result from museum visits. 
Impact was defined in this thesis as ‘the lasting memories of an experience, with 
evidence of cognitive or emotional engagement’ (Chapter 1, p.30). The findings of this 
research, as demonstrated through the analysis of participants’ memories in Chapter 3, 
showed evidence of both cognitive and emotional engagement, even in memories of 
visits that took place several decades before.  

167 
 
 
The hierarchy demonstrated that the presence of ESAK (event specific acquired 
knowledge) was particularly salient. This category referred to information recalled 
about the specific event of the museum visit, and indicated that participants showed 
evidence of recall of details about the museum, such as objects and artworks seen, the 
physical features of the exhibition, or facts and concepts presented within it. This 
confirms that traces of learning can endure in visitors’ memories of museum visits over 
the life span. The museum literature contends that ‘learning’ in museums can range 
from ‘simple awareness of things’ to ‘highly complex conceptual understanding’ 
(Anderson et al., 2007, p.198); these findings provide empirical evidence that such 
incidental or intentional learning is an important part of a museum experience. 
Personal reactions to the visit in the form of thoughts and emotions were also 
particularly salient, suggesting that emotions and cognitions experienced during a 
museum visit can have a long-term impact, again contributing further empirical 
evidence in support of recognition in the literature that emotions associated with the 
experience of visiting have an impact on memorability (Anderson et al., 2007).  
Furthermore, the hierarchy of content suggests the importance of personal connections 
and context. This was evident through the ways in which visitors integrated their 
memory of the visit with their knowledge about themselves, their own personal 
narratives and their sense of personal chronology. This was consistent with the 
contextualisation of episodic events with the autobiographical knowledge base during 
the formation of autobiographical memories, as described by Conway and Pleydell-
Pearce (2000). The importance of visitors’ identity and personal biographies have also 
been widely observed and discussed in the museum literature (Falk, 2016; Anderson et 
al., 2007), with museum researchers suggesting that museums may increase their impact 
or even encourage repeat visits if they can provide visitors with personalised 
experiences that fit with their sense of self (Anderson et al., 2007).   
Memory traces of other information, such as sensory-perceptive information, events (in 
the sense of ‘happenings’), details of place and interactions with others, were all 
present, albeit to a lesser extent than ESAK, participants’ personal reactions, and 
personal context for the visit.  
The hierarchy of content therefore showed how similar visitor memories are, in terms of 
the basic elements of which they consist. This research therefore provides an empirical 
approach based on autobiographical memory theory that relates to discussions in the 

168 
 
 
museum literature about the nature of museum memories. For example, Falk (2016) 
observes, based on his qualitative analysis of museum memories, that memories share 
structural commonalities and are constructed from a small number of basic elements: 
‘we see that the colours and trim on each (memory) are unique, but if we look closely, 
we can discern that structurally each is built from just a handful of basic designs’ 
(p.136).  
The autobiographical memory model used to analyse memory content could be 
transferred and applied to any situation where a museum wishes to understand the long-
term impression it has left on its visitors through particular exhibitions, performances, 
community or access interventions, or indeed any form of programming.  The hierarchy 
of content will help museums to understand the relative salience of the memory traces 
that endure, thus revealing the relative impact of the various aspects of a museum visit; 
such as the design, content and interpretation within an exhibition, the thoughts and 
feelings stimulated in the visitor, their sense of the space they are in, and their 
interactions with others. With the focus in museum practice and research on the 
experiential nature of museums, an empirically driven approach to evaluation based on 
autobiographical memory could provide the crucial link that enables museums to 
understand their impact. 
One aspect of visitor memories where visitor differences did appear to have some 
importance was in analysis of the distribution of memories over the life span (chapter 
3). This research indicated that frequent visitors were more likely to recall museum 
visits from their early years of life (0-9 years), despite the age of their first visit being 
approximately the same as that of the infrequent visitors. It cannot be determined from 
this research whether frequent visitors made more childhood visits, or whether the visits 
were more memorable and if so why; this would be an interesting and worthwhile 
direction for future research. It would also be valuable to explore the role of schools and 
facilitating adults in these memories, especially as museums are increasingly called 
upon to demonstrate the impact of early school visits (Anderson et al., 2007). 
Nonetheless, this research provides empirical findings to support the importance in 
museum practice of programming with young people.  
The life span distribution also suggested a strong effect of recency for the overall 
sample of participants aged 40 and over. This means that participants recalled more 
memories from 40+ than would have been expected had each participants’ memories 

169 
 
 
been evenly distributed across the life span. The recency effect also presented as larger 
and earlier in these findings compared to the theoretical lifespan curve (Conway & 
Pleydell Pearce, 2000).  This indicates that recent memories were more accessible for 
the participants compared to those from the reminiscence bump period of 10-30 years, 
from which a high proportion of memories are usually drawn.  
This suggests that memories of museum visits are not, in general, tightly bound with 
experiences that had an important bearing on identity, such as first-time experiences 
(although these can, of course occur). Rather, the availability of recent memories is 
suggestive of the role of museums in the participants’ more recent sense of cultural 
identity, perhaps as expressed through conversational sharing. Such rehearsal of a 
memory (‘do you remember the exhibition we saw recently?’) may contribute to the 
relative ease with which more recent experiences were recalled. These findings were 
tentative due to the descriptive nature of the data analysis, but are in line with 
observations and suggestions in the museum literature that sharing experiences through 
conversations (rehearsal) is likely to enhance memorability for museum visits 
(Anderson et al., 2007). Further use of the autobiographical memory coding model 
could be applied to see if these findings are replicated with larger samples, and if so, 
what implications this may have for museum’s understanding of their role in visitors’ 
social and cultural lives. 
In summary, findings from this research demonstrate the extent and nature of the impact 
that museums have on visitors. This exploration of the long-term impact of museum 
experiences brings context to the discipline of museum AD by setting out the salient 
features of the experience that AD is seeking to facilitate. The research also contributes 
a new methodology which can equip museums with the evaluation tools they require to 
understand the experiences of their audiences. This form of evaluation was further 
applied in this research to the analysis of experiences facilitated through AD, in order to 
explore the potential of AD as inclusive design. 
AD as a tool for inclusive design 
This research set out to explore the potential for AD as inclusive design, based on the 
rationale that whilst AD provides access for BPS people, it could simultaneously 
enhance access for people with sight, as a kind of ‘guided looking’ (Eardley et al., 
2017). ‘Guided looking’ suggests that visitors with sight may benefit from the potential 
of AD to influence patterns of attention, through spending longer with an object or 

170 
 
 
artwork and taking in details that may otherwise have been missed (Eardley et al., 
2017). The use of multisensory imagery in the language of the AD, along with the 
potential for ‘guided looking’ to bring together visual elements of the photos with 
semantic content, suggested the possibility for enhanced memorability with AD for 
sighted users. However, it was also crucial to explore the experience of using AD for 
sighted people, as there would be little practical benefit of enhanced memorability if 
engagement levels were low. 
The findings of Chapters 3 and 4 confirm a positive picture for the future use of AD in 
inclusive design. In Study 3, the experience of AD for sighted people was compared to a 
standard audio guide (as well as no audio at all). Findings showed that AD did not have 
a negative impact on the experience of viewing photographs (Chapter 4), despite the 
anticipated drawbacks of audio guides in general (Chapter 1), and the longer duration of 
the ADG compared to the SAG. Rather, the quantitative data showed that participants 
who listened to an ADG (compared to a SAG or no audio at all) were just as likely to 
have an enjoyable experience and to want to re-engage with the content. Furthermore, 
they experienced similar levels of autobiographical memories being evoked, that were 
similarly vivid, and their emotional response was comparable to the other two groups. 
In other words, the AD did not have any negative effect on their levels of engagement 
and ability to form personal connections with the artworks, indicating that the 
description of visual elements was not intrusive or distracting to the point where it 
impacted on the experience. 
Furthermore, in the audio evaluation qualitative data, many ADG participants 
commented on their appreciation of the audio, with such comments being more frequent 
in the ADG than in the SAG group. Some of these observations were about the benefits 
of the ‘guided looking’, for example: ‘(the audio) highlighted things that I missed at 
first glance’, and: ‘the audio guide made me look at the photographs more closely and 
gave more depth to their subjects. I thought the guide was very informative and drew 
your eye to certain aspects which may have been missed.’ Others commented on the use 
of narrative: ‘The best part was a story about the photograph’. Another participant 
mentioned the focus of the ADG on the ‘people in the photo - their activity, their 
sensations and feelings’, saying that this made it more ‘interesting and engaging’, which 
also indicates a response to the use of narrative and cognitive prompts in the ADG texts. 
There were also many observations on the general level of enjoyment and the ability of 
the AD to bring the photos to life: ‘It (the audio) provides a rich context for each photo 

171 
 
 
which entices the spectator towards each point of the photograph. It overall gives a 
greater sense of enjoyment as opposed to just the photograph alone’. Other participants 
commented on the ability of the AD to bring the photo to life through sensory 
engagement: ‘very good description of each photo - with the one-man band you could 
virtually hear the music.’ For some, this brought the photos closer to their own 
experience: ‘the sun on their face, grass tickling an arm, boy in the lido who had an 
unexpected shiver - they are experiences which we can relate to and therefore make the 
photo more enjoyable.’ Whereas it was anticipated that the use of multisensory imagery 
may help with memorability, the use of such imagery in the AD texts seems also, for 
some participants, to have contributed to enjoyment and engagement.  
Where criticisms of the audio guide experience did occur, these were no more prevalent 
in the ADG group than in the SAG group, suggesting that the extra time taken to 
describe the visual elements did not have a negative impact on the experience. 
However, whilst there were a relatively low number of negative comments regarding 
duration, some participants (both SAG and, to a slightly greater extent, ADG) did report 
finding the audio too detailed. Whilst a certain level of detail will be required for an 
audio text to function as AD, and facilitate the creation of mental images, the level of 
detail should be critically reviewed in terms of the trade-off between mental image 
generation and the cognitive load engendered by lots of information. This is particularly 
relevant in the context of the findings of Study 1 (Chapter 2), which suggested that not 
all BPS museum visitors actively engage in building mental images, (see also Fryer, 
2013).  
Furthermore, it may often be possible, depending on the object/artwork that the AD is 
addressing, to come up with creative ways to deliver the spatial information (the layout 
of visual elements) in a way that is engaging and simultaneously offers enriching 
information or narrative. For example, in the descriptions of photographs used in this 
research, a number of ADG participants (27%) interpreted the spatial information as 
information about composition, and indeed the description of the spatial relationship of 
the visual elements did by definition inform participants about the layout of the photo. 
Although the spatial information was provided to allow the text to function as AD, it 
was also valued as contributing to understanding: ‘the audio guide gave lots of 
information about the composition of the photos…I would have spent a few seconds 
looking at each photo without the audio’ (ADG participant). Another ADG participant 
commented: ‘the audio guide gave an interesting perspective on each photo, not only 

172 
 
 
describing what was being depicted, but also the photographic techniques used… the 
imagery, the use of angles, and shapes e.g. diagonals.’ Building enriching information 
such as narrative or multisensory imagery into the provision of spatial elements is 
something that could be emphasised in AD training. This example demonstrates how it 
can be achieved: 
We stand with Grant (Henry Grant: the photographer), facing the children, who 
are thundering across the playground towards us. The school buildings are 
approximately 30-40 metres away and the crowd of school children spreads out 
between us and the buildings - the nearest boy will reach us in just a second or 
two. 
In this way, the spatial information about the scene is provided but it simultaneously 
seeks to keep the text engaging for the listener by building anticipation and narrative. 
Crucially, the results of Study 3 also demonstrated that AD led to richer memories of 
the photos a month later. The richer nature of the memories, and the content that was 
identified within them, is important when considering how museums can help to 
increase their impact, when understood as evidence of long-term cognitive or emotional 
engagement. The memories of the photos analysed in Study 3 all indicated a level of 
impact, with cognitive and emotional engagement suggested through the recall of the 
photos’ content, socio-historical information and information about the photographer, as 
well as thoughts and feelings in response to the photos. ‘Impact’, therefore, was a 
consequence of the photo presentation, regardless of the original mode of presentation 
(SAG, ADG or no audio).  
However, the key finding was that whilst ADG participants’ pattern of recall was 
broadly similar to the other groups, higher numbers of details were recalled, suggesting 
a greater level of impact. As discussed in Chapter 4, the mechanism(s) by which this 
occurred are difficult to dissociate: the nature of ‘guided looking’, multisensory imagery 
or narrative may all have contributed to various extents. It seems unlikely that the 
increased recall was primarily due to the novelty of presentation, as participants’ 
comments did not indicate any surprise about the format, and indeed the spatial 
information, when commented upon, was interpreted as information about composition. 
Only one person’s comments revealed that they had made the connection between the 
ADG and how a work might be presented to a blind person. From a museum’s 
perspective, knowing that the AD enhanced memorability is arguably more important 

173 
 
 
than knowing the precise mechanisms by which this may have occurred. However, the 
current findings and analysis of the qualitative data suggest that multisensory imagery, 
guided looking and narrative all played a role.  In summary, Study 3 suggests that the 
use of AD techniques in museum audio provision would have a positive impact on 
visitors’ experience and memorability, regardless of their level of vision. 
Study 4 further sought to explore the impact of perceptual enrichment of AD, and its 
impact on all potential users (BPS and sighted). This research was the first empirical 
exploration of the impact of sound enrichment in AD on experience, engagement and 
memorability in blind and sighted people. The use of sound is advocated in AD (de 
Coster & Muehleis, 2007; Giansante, 2013; Neves, 2012, 2016) and has been explored 
by practitioners (Eardley et al., 2017). The potential of sound enrichment for inclusive 
design in these findings was extremely positive, in two respects. Firstly, the use of 
sound was preferred by BPS and sighted participants, with the frequent observation that 
it brought the photos to life and increased the sense of being in the scene. Secondly, 
sound enrichment was able to increase recall of the photos, and details about them for 
the BPS participants, to the extent that the level of recall in the BPS cohort for EDG 
was the same as that of the sighted cohort. Therefore, sound enrichment provided better 
‘access’ for BPS participants in the sense that the photos were able to have the same 
impact (including cognitive and emotional engagement) on them as they did on the 
sighted participants.  
Although overall participants preferred EDG, the BPS as well as the sighted participants 
expressed a range of opinions about the sounds, with both positive and negative 
reactions to the use of sound overall and individual sounds specifically. This emphasises 
the need for sound enrichment to be offered as a choice, and for various curatorial 
approaches to including sounds to be further explored through future research. For 
example, the impact of congruency, authenticity, frequency or duration of sounds could 
all be the subject of future studies. The use of sound enrichment may also lend itself 
better to some objects and artworks than others. However, the potential for the sound 
enrichment to have an impact on the experience of someone with low or no vision was 
clear from the qualitative comments. One participant with partial sight made the 
following comment: ‘Oh, it just brought it all to life.  It felt as though I was listening to 
a Radio Four story.  It was as if I was actually transported to the actual place itself.  I 
wouldn’t get that from a photo.’  The ability of sound to bring the photos to life was 
equally important to this congenitally blind participant:  

174 
 
 
if it had just been purely description, I don’t think I would have quite got as 
much of a feel for it, but because the sounds effects were there… it brought it 
more to life, like the scenery. You could imagine being there….So, the fact that 
the sound was there enabled me to visualise it in my own way… without the 
sound effects… I would have still got a lot from the descriptions and I would 
have enjoyed it but, I think, it would have been a bit less impactful. I just think, 
for blind people we appreciate things that we can identify with, so we appreciate 
things we can hear. 
In summary, the enjoyment of sound by both BPS and sighted participants contributes 
empirical findings to the audio guide literature that discusses the benefits of sound 
enrichment in standard guides (Bertens & Polak, 2019; Marshall et al., 2016), and the 
current research addresses this from an inclusive design perspective. Most importantly, 
the findings of this research validate and support the use of sound as an additional 
choice in AD delivery, for all visitors, regardless of their level of vision. 
Finally, Studies 3 and 4 provide further tentative support for the understanding of the 
hierarchy of content in memories, as shown in the descriptive breakdown of the photo 
recall memories. (Chapter 4, p.105, Chapter 5, p.134).  In studies 3 and 4, the photo 
recall task was focused on recall of content, rather than an overall museum experience. 
As such, the photo recall memories may have been more episodic in nature, with the 
photo recall information being one component of an overall autobiographical memory 
of taking part in the study. However, the pattern of content within the photo memories 
adds to our understanding of the content that may be present within episodic memories, 
or autobiographical memories if the episodic information is later integrated with 
knowledge about the self.  
Firstly, elements of content were the most salient category, for example, ‘there were 
eels in the photo’, in other words, information which could have been encoded from 
vision or from listening to the guide. This is consistent with the salience of EASK 
(‘event specific acquired knowledge’) in Study 2, and is consistent with the occurrence 
of learning (intentional or incidental) in everyday memory (Cohen & Conway, 2007). 
Furthermore, there was evidence of further cognitive engagement through recall of 
factual or contextual information, as well as thoughts and reflections. The presence of 
emotional engagement was clear through the emotional reactions to the experience. The 
development of personal connections was also indicated in Studies 3 and 4 by the high 

175 
 
 
proportion of participants in both studies who reported their own personal memories 
being evoked during the presentation of the photos. Therefore, the analysis of memory 
content, whether it be for museum visits in the past (chapter 2) or for the recall of photo 
stimuli a month before (Chapters 4 and 5), suggested similarities in the hierarchy of 
content and demonstrated evidence of impact. Again, the content of these different types 
of memories provide crucial information for museums regarding the long-term impact 
that artworks and experiences have on visitors. 
Inclusive AD: implications for practice and avenues for future 
research 
The aspiration of inclusive design is to enable enjoyable, shared, inclusive experiences 
which benefit all users. In 2011, a team of collaborators from between Art beyond Sight 
and Museum of Science, Boston, published their qualitative findings about the needs 
and preferences of blind visitors to art museums. Their report followed a series of focus 
groups with BPS participants held at 7 major art museums throughout the United States, 
with the intention to provide professional development for museum professionals and to 
inform on the development of museum programming for BPS visitors (Reich et al., 
2011). Whilst the report focused on the needs of the specific access audience, rather 
than on inclusive design, the need for inclusive experiences was evident throughout the 
findings presented. Participants stated that what they would like museums to develop 
would be the creation of a welcoming atmosphere with the provision of social 
experiences that they could enjoy alongside their sighted companions (Reich et al, 
2011). This was part of their desired outcome of being socially involved: a motivation 
which is crucial in light of the fact that spending time with friends and family is a major 
reason for museum visiting (Packer & Ballantyne, 2005). Participants also emphasised 
the need for intellectual and emotional stimulation. Furthermore, they wished to be able 
to explore museums independently and to be able to visit on their own. The final desired 
outcome was that accommodations made for them (i.e., ‘access’) would have universal 
appeal. These findings emphasise the desire of BPS visitors to visit museums and enjoy 
them with others, blind and sighted, with emphasis on both social experiences and 
opportunities for independence (Reich et al., 2011). 
The current research suggests that the incorporation of AD techniques in recorded audio 
would significantly further the aims captured in the Reich et al. (2011) study and help 
museums to enhance the engagement of their visitors regardless of their level of vision. 

176 
 
 
This would also help museums to fulfil their social inclusion and access agendas. More 
widespread provision of inclusive audio descriptive guides that could be used by all 
would immediately open up more collections to BPS people and allow for more shared 
experiences, as the current provision of ADGs in museums is low (Cock et al, 2018). 
Listening to ADGs that not only describe the visual appearance of exhibits, but also 
seek to tell a story and provide context and meaning, would stand to provide additional 
‘support’ to help all visitors engage more deeply with collections, irrespective of their 
visual status. This would help to provide the emotional and intellectual stimulation 
sought by BPS visitors as reported by Reich et al. (2011), and would be likely to 
enhance the long-term impact for all listeners (Study 3). The report from Reich et al. 
(2011) also emphasises that BPS museum visitors are not a homogenous group (which 
also applies to sighted visitors). Rather, they have diverse interests and needs which will 
require various approaches to the design and delivery of interpretation. This is 
consistent with the findings of this research and suggests several possible directions for 
future research, in terms of the flexibility and choice in delivery of inclusive AD.  
This research kept technology deliberately out of scope, for the purpose of explicitly 
isolating AD from its delivery, in order to understand its impact. Presenting the AD 
through a device in these studies, whilst attractive from an ecological validity 
perspective, would have introduced additional variability. This would have reduced the 
validity of the conclusions reached about AD itself. In other words, it would have been 
very difficult to deduce whether the AD, or the device, was impacting on memorability 
and experience. However, the next phase of research should most certainly explore the 
integration of AD and technology, with the myriad of creative opportunities for 
engagement that this will offer. 
Future research could examine the impact of layering information, so that listeners can 
access description distinctly from factual or contextual information, for example. Whilst 
separation of these types of information allows for an initial sensory response to the 
artwork, as advocated by some practitioners, others advocate interweaving the 
description and information which would allow for the closer linking of semantic 
content to mental imagery (chapter 2). It would be useful to explore the benefits of both 
approaches, in different museum settings.  
Other aspects relating to choice and flexibility in AD delivery would also be well worth 
exploring. Allowing for sound enrichment to be present as an option would no doubt be 

177 
 
 
valuable, to allow listeners to switch from standard AD to sound enriched AD, from one 
exhibit to the next, according to their preference. Providing true parity of experience 
(Chapter 2) through inclusive AD also means facilitating a variety of AD experiences, 
to allow BPS visitors to have access to the range of experiences that sighted people do. 
For example, offering short ‘clips’ of AD might provide an experience similar to the 
quick glance of a sighted person, which helps them decide whether to linger at an 
artwork or move on. This may also be appreciated by sighted visitors, as a 30 second 
‘burst’ of guided looking through audio may provide more support than the equivalent 
number of seconds of unsupported looking as described in the research literature (Smith 
& Smith, 2001, Smith, Smith & Tinio, 2017).  
Whereas much museum AD is delivered by the professional voice of a describer, 
sometimes in conjunction with a curator, the use of different voices in AD could be 
more widely explored and exploited. The use of different voices, perhaps even other 
museum visitors (through collaborative description), may help to maintain attention and 
interest, or even incite curiosity, and such potential techniques have been discussed and 
explored at AD events (Thompson, 2018). 
Different modes of delivery in recorded AD would be worth investigating. If access to 
an engaging museum experience means creating opportunities for social interaction, 
then exploring alternatives such as listening stations or linked devices (Aoki et al., 
2003) would be important and useful, as would the use of headphones that deliver 
content into one ear only, allowing for simultaneous social interaction with companions. 
Delivery of inclusive AD through these alternative formats may help to reduce the 
isolation effect of audio guides in general (Aoki et al., 2003) and enhance the inclusive 
nature of shared experiences.  
The focus of the current research is recorded audio, as researching recorded AD was 
deemed to be the optimal starting point for this empirical study of museum AD. It is 
more practical to control variables within the participant experience with recorded AD 
compared to live tours, enabling stronger conclusions to be drawn about the AD 
variables under investigation. This was important considering the lack of empirical 
findings on museum AD. However, live AD tours are an important part of museums’ 
AD offering (Chapter 2) and offer more opportunity for interaction and social 
engagement, thus, access to a different museum experience that is also in need of 
research attention. From an inclusive design perspective, there is potential for standard 

178 
 
 
museum tours to incorporate AD techniques, thereby becoming more accessible, 
although they would also need to incorporate navigation in order for BPS visitors to 
make full, independent use of them. However, it would be valuable to explore what 
impact the use of AD techniques has on sighted visitors during a guided tour. If there is 
the same benefit for memorability and impact as suggested here for recorded AD, then 
this would have further exciting potential for inclusive experiences. Inclusive tours 
could offer new ways of engaging with art and objects for all visitors, as well as for 
museum staff, who may enjoy new ways of ‘seeing’ (Eardley et al., 2017) 
Finally, the promising results for sound enrichment reported here could be developed in 
multiple directions. Whilst the EDGs used in this study contained some limited spatial 
elements (footsteps moving from left to right, for example), fully immersive binaural 
soundscaping was outside the scope of this research. Further work could explore the 
impact of such delivery on both BPS and sighted participants. AD research in film has 
been exploring in recent years whether words in AD can be replaced by sounds (Lopez 
& Pauletto, 2009), for example, a chair leg scraping on the floor, versus ‘he leaves the 
table.’ This may help to reduce the amount of detail that AD needs to provide, which 
may help all listeners with processing the information, although sound localisation may 
be more challenging for sighted people and the replacement of verbal AD with 
directional/spatial sound would potentially reduce the guided looking benefits of AD. It 
would be interesting to explore the impact of this technique in museum AD. One BPS 
participant in Study 4 noted the spatial direction of sounds in an EDG text, and 
commented to this effect: 
the example I gave earlier about the boat, it enabled you to orientate in terms of 
the sound and it matched the description. So in the description of the picture I 
know that the man is standing on the left, I know that his feet are really close to 
the edge of the water and that the water threatens to make his feet wet.  And the 
sound came from the left, and … I know that from the description the boat is 
travelling from my left to my right and so the sound went in the same way.  So it 
frees up brain cells to go and think about something else….  And it just added to 
the depth of the experience, it felt more participative. 
Research has suggested the importance of perceptual sound to sighted listeners in audio 
drama (Fryer et al., 2013; Rodero, 2012), but not for BPS listeners (Fryer et al, 2013), 
although the findings of Study 4 support the notion that auditory imagery is of particular 

179 
 
 
importance to BPS people in recall (Tekcan et al., 2015).This is therefore an area that 
merits further research attention in terms of the trade-off between words and sounds in 
AD, suggesting this as a valuable future avenue for inclusive AD research. 
Rethinking museum AD 
This thesis developed understanding to address the central research question of how AD 
might support access to an engaging museum experience for visitors with and without 
sight. The findings show that AD could become an important tool in inclusive museum 
interpretation due to its ability to provide access for BPS people and simultaneously 
enhance access for sighted people, and its ability to facilitate a rich experience. AD 
therefore has potential to increase independence of visiting for BPS people and to create 
new shared and inclusive experiences. AD can help to address a broader experience of 
museum exhibits than access purely to visual information, as evidenced by the presence 
of learning, thoughts and feelings in the memories analysed in this research. In this 
sense, it is an important tool for museums who seek to reduce the reliance on visual 
access in their settings and who are prepared to look creatively at other, non-visual, 
ways of engagement. In order to take this new understanding of the function and 
potential of AD forward, it is important to revisit the original assumptions about what it 
seeks to achieve. 
These research findings have brought into question whether or not museum AD should 
be considered as a visual to verbal translation, or whether it should rather seek to 
address the museum experience (Study 1). The empirical exploration of experiences of 
artworks and experiences in museums presented here demonstrates that the lasting 
impact of such experiences shows evidence of cognitive and emotional engagement. 
Museum AD therefore must address the broader experience of museum visiting, in 
order to ensure it is optimising the opportunities for such cognitive and emotional 
engagement to occur.  
Simultaneously, as a tool for inclusive design, it can help to provide the interpretation 
support that is needed for many visitors to engage, not exclusively an access audience. 
Expanding the remit of museum AD as a form of inclusive interpretation that facilitates 
an engaging museum experience therefore means going beyond the provision of visual 
information. However, this research strongly suggests that in so doing, it will enhance 
access for all its users. Taken together, the findings of this thesis therefore support the 

180 
 
 
argument for an approach to museum description that seeks to arouse emotion, draw the 
listener into a story, or incite their curiosity, with the explicit aim of creating access to 
an engaging experience. This does not suggest that the translation issues of objectivity 
and describer visibility are no longer important, or no longer apply (see Chapter 2). 
Rather, such an approach allows for levels of personal interpretation and subjectivity, 
but with a transparent and self-aware approach to description from practitioners. 
Such self-reflexivity is already discussed and encouraged by translation scholars 
(Chesterman, 1997; Van Wyke, 2010, see Chapter 2 for discussion) but could be 
discussed, validated, even promoted further in museum AD.  Such approaches are likely 
to already happen in practice, particularly in live AD tours, where it may be more 
natural for a describer to incorporate narrative, or even offer an opinion or reaction to an 
artwork which is self-evidently (or explicitly) subjective. Such an approach may enliven 
AD delivery and increase engagement. Training resources for museum describers, 
which have been in development during the course of this research in the form of the 
ADLab Pro project (ADLabPro, 2019) provide important endorsement of this approach. 
The materials specific to museums and static art AD state that a ‘freer approach’ is 
permissible, and draw upon comparisons with film to clarify their position: 
While for AD in general the use of appraisal (that is personal interpretations, 
subjective description) is either frowned upon or acceptable in small doses, in 
describing works of art, especially those considered worthy of description, it is 
difficult to avoid using expressions of approval, pleasure and personal 
interpretation. Within reason, this can help to bring the exhibit to life for the PSL 
(person with sight loss, my emphasis in the text). The phrase ‘a beautiful girl’ in 
film translation is a subjective opinion and should be avoided. But describing 
artworks as ‘magnificent’ or ‘remarkable’ and colours as ‘voluptuous’ would 
seem to be more acceptable, take for example ‘these magnificent 17th century 
tapestries’. 
These training materials therefore take the previously limited recognition of 
interpretative techniques in the guidelines further (ADI, cited in RNIB, 2010; ADC, 
2009), with the emphasis on the potential to bring the text to life. This firmly shifts the 
focus away from objectivity and onto the recipient experience, with all the aspects of 
engagement that this implies. Such advice is likely to be welcomed by many, as it 
validates the opinion of many practitioners that interpretative techniques can be 

181 
 
 
acceptable in museum AD (Chapter 2). The academic and art expert Georgina Kleege, 
who is herself blind, puts forward a similar case in More Than Meets The Eye (Kleege, 
2018): 
If I can derive any specific recommendations from the comments of these three 
artists, and from my own experience as a museum-goer, it would be to abandon 
the pretext of objectivity. It is impossible and besides the point. The blind 
listener knows that there’s some interpretation involved in even the most basic 
description, and often the systematic cataloguing of depicted objects is more 
information than anyone wants. Once the pretense of objectivity is abandoned, it 
could be replaced with descriptions of the artist’s techniques, as well as the 
effect the work has on the viewer, recognizing that this will differ from 
individual to individual. (p.121) 
Again, the emphasis here is to be shifted from objective ‘cataloguing’ of visual 
elements on to the effect that art has on people, namely the experience. The current 
findings take important steps towards exploring how expanding our understanding of 
that experience can underpin development and evaluation of museum AD. 
Museum AD has been an under researched segment of AD, and advice for museum 
describers has been hereto limited (chapter 2). As this is addressed (ADlab Pro, 2019), 
and empirical research continues to explore the impact of museum AD on people’s 
experiences, it seems likely that museum AD will continue to carve out its own unique 
and differentiated place in the field of AD. With countless opportunities for future 
research and development of the discipline, there are doubtless many new and creative 
avenues to be explored in order to bring museums’ collections to life for all visitors. 
Summary of contribution to knowledge: 
This thesis has made a number of important and novel contributions to the fields of 
AVT, psychology and museums. Firstly, it has expanded the AD research by providing 
the first empirical reception studies of museum AD. It has taken AD research in new 
directions by substantially increasing the empirical data available about the potential for 
AD as inclusive design. Furthermore, it provides the first insight into international 
views and practices of museum describers. Taken together, these studies advance the 
current understanding of museum AD significantly. In psychology, this work develops 
understanding of memories for cultural events and provides theoretically driven 

182 
 
 
evaluation measures (autobiographical memory coding model) that can be applied to 
other questions and settings to further develop our understanding of the impact of 
cultural experience. For museum practice, this work provides the first empirical 
investigation of inclusive audio interpretation, clearly demonstrating that AD could be 
taken out of its access ‘niche’ and considered as an inclusive interpretation tool to 
enhance engagement and access for all visitors. The work further adds to the empirical 
data on the experience and memorability of audio guide use more generally. Finally, 
this research contributes an evaluation tool for museums, the autobiographical memory 
coding model. This model provides museums with a theoretically driven method to 
explore and understand the lasting impact that they have on their visitors, in terms of 
cognitive, emotional and social engagement – in other words, to what extent optimal 
access is being achieved for all.

Title of Study:  Audio Description for Museums: Exploring Practitioner Views  
Very little research has been carried out into Museum audio description. This project 
represents a collaboration between museum studies, psychology and audio-visual 
translation researchers at the University of Westminster, in collaboration with 
VocalEyes, UK, to explore audio description specifically within Museums. In order to 
understand and develop the field we would like to gather information and expertise 
from the people who are currently delivering AD for and within Museums. It is crucial 
to get a full understanding of your priorities and processes as Audio Describers.   
You will be asked to complete a short questionnaire to share your views and 
experiences, which should take approximately 10-20 minutes to complete. The 
questionnaire is divided into two sections. The first section seeks your view on 
methodologies, considering aspects such as coverage and selection, and content and 
style. In the second part, we ask for some details to help us understand your activity as 
an Audio Describer. All sections have additional space for you to include comments on 
anything you consider of importance which we have not addressed. 
There is space for you to leave your email address if you would like an update on the 
results of the study. The project has been approved by the University of Westminster 
Psychology Department ethics committee.     
This research forms part of a wider research project on Museum AD. The project will 
examine the impact of Museum AD on visitor experience and memorability, 
considering both sighted visitors and those with visual impairment, thereby exploring 
AD as an opportunity for Inclusive Design.

missed. 
1.Coverage and Selection:     How do you plan a description for a particular museum 
artwork or artefact?     (For example: Which factors determine what you decide to 
describe, and what you decide to omit? Do you describe the gallery/museum space? Do 
you gather information from curators or other sources? How do you incorporate it?)

In this study, we are interested in exploring memories of museum visits that have been 
important to us throughout life. Autobiographical memory is described as our own 
personal scrapbook, containing information about ourselves and our past experiences. 
Autobiographical memory resides in a memory system which consists of episodes 
recollected from an individual’s life, based on a combination of both episodic (personal 
experiences and specific objects, people, and events experienced at a specific 
time/place), and semantic memory (general knowledge and facts about the world). We 
are interested in memory for museum visits in particular because we are exploring the 
role of cultural experiences in our lives and the development of our sense of self.  In 
recent years, research has examined the distribution of autobiographical memories over 
the life span, and it has been proposed that older adults report a higher frequency of 
autobiographical memories for experiences that occurred between the ages of 15-30, 
compared with other life periods. Furthermore, this phenomenon has been found across 
cultures, and through the use of various methods, including responses to word cues, 
olfactory cues, and musical cues. This study will contribute to this field of research by 
developing understanding about the ways in which autobiographical memory in relation 
to cultural experience may be more salient for certain life periods.  Please be assured 
that all the information collected today will remain anonymous and will be treated with 
and stored with strict confidentially, and as such it will not be possible for your 
responses to be identified within the data archive. Your participation in the present 
study is highly appreciated, and we hope that it will give us a greater understanding of 
group patterns in memory for museums that have been important to us.  I would be very 
grateful if you could refrain from discussing the nature of this research project with 
other potential participants to ensure that it does not have an effect on their responses.  
If you have any further questions regarding the nature of the study or if you would like a 
copy of the outcomes of the research once complete, please contact Rachel Hutchinson 
on the following email address: w1580109@my.westminster.ac.uk .     Thank you for 
your participation.

Appendix 2.2: Instructions and examples for second coder 
Step 1:  Classifying memory type: 
Categorise the memory as either a non-memory, a general memory, or a specific 
memory. 
Select Non-Memory if the text given by the respondent does not constitute any kind of 
memory, for example a generic comment such as ‘I like the Science Museum’. 
Select General Memory if there was no clear information in the memory that enabled it 
to be situated in a specific day or moment. General memories might be an 
amalgamation of many different visits, perhaps typifying a life period, for example: 
‘Natural History Museum: Many visits with our children beginning when they were 5 
and 3 respectively.’ 
Also include descriptive memories without a spatial-temporal context in this category, 
for example: ‘Cragside Northumberland. Large National Trust estate. Historic house, 
the first to be lit by electricity, flame shaped shades on staircase lamps. Bedroom with 
owls carved on bedposts. attic room filled with curiosities from around the world. A 
warren of a house developed over a number of years using proceeds from the armament 
industry.’ 
The use of a single grammatical tense throughout is an indicator to class the fragment as 
a general memory. For example, the present tense only is used here: ‘Fitzwilliam 
museum Cambridge. I always visit when in the area. They have an amazing permanent 
collection. .. Think it is a beautiful building and it has a nice café.’ The sole use of the 
past tense can be less clear, as in this example: ‘The V&A - I really liked that for most 
of the things displayed there they had an audio information if you are interested to hear 
more about what are you looking at. I liked that the way of display followed a historical 
line - from early centuries to recent times.’ Here, the use of the past tense throughout 
could indicate two scenarios. Firstly, that the memory does indeed refer to a specific 
moment in the past. I ‘liked’ it (on the day that I visited). Alternatively, I ‘liked’ it, on 
the many occasions when I visited. As it cannot not be clearly determined which 
scenario applies, classify as general. 
Memory fragments with no verbs are by definition classed as general, as there was no 
verb construction to link detail to any specific moment: ‘Saatchi Gallery. Wonderful 

208 
 
 
exhibition by young new artists. A beautiful pencil drawing of a massive sequoia. a 
hyper realistic statue of a swimmer.’ 
Select Specific Memory if there is some detail which indicates a particular day or 
moment. This could be a reference to the time when the visit happened, e.g. ‘The first 
time I went to the science museum’, or it could be the recall of something specific that 
happened there: ‘I can never forget the scream I heard from my little brother when we 
first walked in and the rush of adrenaline in me when I saw that skeleton.’  
A change in tense may be an indicator that a memory is moving from a general memory 
to a specific moment, for example with a shift from present to past tense. In the 
following memory, the fragment contains a shift from the present tense, to the present 
perfect (‘has created’) to the introduction of a specific detail in the past simple tense 
(bold type): ‘Preston Park Museum, Stockton. Good place to take children as it is in a 
parkland setting. with other attractions such as butterfly house and playground. Museum 
has recreated street of shops, printer and stationer, chemist, cobbler etc, some of which 
sold items, some just had exhibits. Also had a valuable painting, The Card players I 
think, can't remember artist, housed in a darkened room by itself, very reverential, made 
you feel you could only whisper’. This shift in tense through to a specific moment in the 
past is considered adequate to classify the overall memory as a ‘specific memory.’ 
Step 2: identify special memories: 
Special Memories: this category includes memories that have an emotional element that 
indicates an enduring relevance and salience for the participant. For example, a memory 
of doing something for the first time (the first time I ever visited London), a memory 
that was in some way self-defining (seeing the work of Monet that I had dreamed of 
seeing since childhood), culture-defining  (a moment of external relevance and 
importance for a generation, eg 9/11) or that marked a moment of transition (during this 
visit, I finally understood why art could be exciting). Memories that were coded as ‘first 
time, ‘self-defining’, ‘culture-defining’ or ‘transitional’ are grouped into the category 
‘special memories’. Memory fragments were not counted in more than one of the 
subcategories, meaning they did not artificially inflate the overall score for ‘special 
memories.’ However, self-defining, culture defining or transitional memories could also 
be first-time memories: eg the visit was the first date I went on with my future husband) 
All other memories are categorised as ‘Other Recollection.’ 

209 
 
 
Step 3: code for memory content: 
For each unique description you are asked to code the segments of text using a series of 
codes, described below. A segment of text is based on units of meaning, and can 
therefore range from a single word to an entire sentence. However, discrete segments 
are only coded once – no double coding across categories. 
Sensory-Perceptual Categories: 
Visual: a visual image recalled by the participant: including colours, conditions of 
light/darkness: for example: ‘The big red blue and white targets on the sides of the 
planes’, ‘light flooded in from the outside’. Where size or scale is associated with visual 
detail, then this is also counted as visual: ‘little coloured engraved details’ (However see 
also ‘spatial’ section). Reports of the experience of visual images were also coded in 
this category: ‘I can visualise the scene now.’  
Spatial: the scale of the environment ‘the museum was big’ or the scale of objects 
within the environment: ‘huge canvases’. The spatial layout of objects or elements of 
the environment, such as ‘suspended from the ceiling.’ Spatial information situating the 
participant within their environment: ‘I remember standing under the glass pyramid’. 
Details of how space is perceived: ‘acres of open space’, ‘the curve of the space was so 
unusual’, ‘low ceilings’. 
Auditory: sounds heard, or the absence of sound, such as ‘there was this amazing 
singing or chanting’, ‘there was just a huge silence.’ 
Taste: a memory of a particular food eaten or the taste of something, such as ‘also 
remember the so so good, and warm cinnamon bun’. Mentions of the act of eating are 
not included in this category as they don’t represent a true taste image or sensory 
experience, but rather an event detail. Details such as ‘we had lunch’ are therefore 
included in ‘event’, in the sense of a ‘happening.’ 
Tactile: detail of touching something or texture: ‘I remember the smoothness of some of 
the statues.’ 
Olfactory: specific smells reported or the memory of a smell ‘I remember a strong smell 
of beeswax’, ‘It all smelt wonderful.’ 

210 
 
 
Kinaesthetic: Movement is included in this category e.g. ‘detail regarding the body such 
as ‘we sat down’, or use of part of the body to grab, dip one’s hand in, etc. Something 
like ‘I ran through the gallery’, would receive a coding of Kinaesthetic for ‘I ran 
through’ and Place for ‘the gallery’.  
Pain: any mention of pain, discomfort or fatigue is included in this category. E.g. ‘I had 
tummy ache’ or ‘my feet hurt’ or ‘I was tired’.  
Emotion: Any mention of emotions experienced is coded in this category, whether 
reported directly as a feeling: ‘I was very emotional’, or whether reported indirectly: 
‘the atmosphere was incredible.’ Reports of the emotions of others were included in the 
category ‘event.’ See ‘social interaction’ for classification of emotions in the first-
person plural. 
The verbs ‘to like’ and ‘to love’ denote enthusiasm and therefore indicate a count for 
emotion. For example: ‘I liked the displays’, or ‘I loved the paintings.’ 
Cognition: details classed as thoughts or implications are coded in this category. This 
included thoughts relating directly to the exhibit or its subject matter: ‘stunning, 
exceptionally high quality photos’, thoughts relating to the overall experience: ‘I 
remember thinking about how grand it all looked’, thoughts generated in response to the 
event (visit): ‘For the first time in my life, I had mixed feeling towards my faith’ and 
thoughts relating to the rememberer themselves and their autobiographical memories: 
‘reminded me of flying my kite with my dad.’ Expressions of interest or fascination are 
included as cognition, not emotion. Aesthetic judgements are also cognition: ‘it was 
beautiful’.  Note that when a cognition is coded, elements of the thought are not coded 
further (to avoid double coding). Eg, the following would score 1 for cognition, but 
‘rooms’ would not require a ‘place’ score: ‘The rooms felt as though Monet and his 
family had just popped out for a moment and might arrive any minute back in the room’ 
NOTE: The cognitions are related to what people thought at the moment. Or thoughts 
they had about it after the experience. Where people say ‘I remember going into a long 
room’ the ‘I remember’ is not coded as cognition.   
Context -time: includes abstract, thematic knowledge that contextualises other 
information in terms of the rememberer’s personal history (Conway et al., 1992). 
Examples of this are the ‘back story’ provided by the participants to contextualise their 

211 
 
 
memory, eg ‘I was on a school trip’, ‘the first time I went to a museum on my own’, 
‘the first museum I visited in London’ (this example would receive one count for 
‘context’ and one for ‘place.’). 
Secondly, this category also includes information from participants that provides 
context in the memory but is too broad in scope to count as a specific detail, for 
example: ‘there was a lot of stuff to do with the world war’.. Thus, comments that 
qualify the visit in some way are also included in this category: ‘there was plenty to see 
and do’, ‘I don’t usually use an audio guide’. Information was counted as context if it 
was given in the passive voice ‘there were a lot of paintings.’ If an active verb is 
attributed, eg ‘we saw a lot of paintings’, then it would count as ‘event’ (in this 
example, event + ESAK). ‘There was a lot of art’  - passive voice  - context. ‘We saw a 
lot of art’ – active voice – event. Time: includes details that place the museum visit in 
the participant’s sense of autobiographical chronology: ‘last summer’, ‘about a year 
ago’, ‘last year when I went to Scotland for the first time.’ It also includes details on 
perceived duration ‘the tour lasted an hour’, ‘it was a short trip’. 
Place: details of the physical environment of the museum, such as references to the 
different floors of the museum, the shop or café, or physical features such as ‘a massive 
grand hall’. Mention of the location (city, region). Note that where the participants gave 
a title to their memory, e.g. ‘the Natural history Museum’, this is not coded for place, as 
treating these as part of the memory text would overly inflate the place counts. 
However, if specific information was given within the title ‘eg Australian 
Impressionists at the National Gallery’, then this would receive one count for ESAK’. 
Multiple identical references to the same part of the museum, e.g. ‘the rooms’ are coded 
for ‘place’ the first time, but not with every repeated use (see example at end of 
document)  
Event: In line with other autobiographical memory coding systems (Levine et al., 2002), 
this category includes happenings ‘we lost my son’, ‘there was a book reading by an 
author’, ‘we had a guided tour’, as well as weather conditions ‘It was raining’. It also 
includes references to people present who were not known to the rememberer ‘there 
were hosts in pink shirts’, or mentions of crowding in the museum e.g. ‘it was too 
crowded to see much’. Emotional reactions or physical actions of others were coded as 
‘event’: ‘She was fit to burst with pride’, ‘I watched a man draw.’ 
 

212 
 
 
Social Interaction: This includes details of any reported interactions with others, known 
and unknown. A reported joint emotion counts as social interaction as interaction is 
implicit: ‘we laughed’, ‘we were disappointed.’ Joint expressions of interest also: ‘we 
were fascinated.’ However a joint action such as ‘we saw lots of paintings’ is not coded 
as a social interaction as this activity could be done alongside someone without 
necessarily interacting with them. 
Person/People: detail to do with a person or people known to the rememberer at 
subsequent recall (e.g. friend or family member, teacher, or tour guide).  If a fragment 
has been coded as social interaction, but also includes a ‘person’ detail, this does not 
require an additional ‘person’ count as the presence of another person is implied.  
Event-Specific Acquired Knowledge: this category includes details internal to the event 
(visit), for example objects or artworks seen, such as ‘Queen Victoria’s wedding dress’, 
‘the Mona Lisa’, and details of them, such as the ‘different expressions and postures’ of 
the Terracotta Army soldiers. This category also includes physical features of the 
exhibition ‘you can take a walk on an old Pan AM plane’, its displays ‘there was a 
display of the tomb where they were found and how they were found’, or facts/concepts 
recalled ‘(Scotland)... merged with England but was originally separate’, ‘they (artists) 
used logos of famous brands to create their pieces criticising the actions, or the lack of 
effective actions from big nations such as US and also UN.’ Knowledge about 
something seen within the museum can be coded as ESAK, if even general 
‘statues/paintings’. Information given which qualifies the name of the museum can also 
be counted as ESAK ‘Australian Impressionists, XXX.’ 
Text Segmentation and Scoring: A segment of text was based on units of meaning, and 
could range from a single word to an entire sentence. However, discrete segments were 
only counted once within the multiple categories of Level 3. In the following example, a 
participant recalled a visit to Monet’s house:  
 
The rooms felt as though Monet and his family had just popped out for a 
moment and might arrive any minute back in the room (cognition=1). I felt almost a 
sense of intrusion (emotion=1) shuffling through (kinaesthetic=1) the crowded (event) 
rooms (place*) examining the saucepans etc (event-specific acquired knowledge).  I 
remember the colours within the rooms being so vivid (visual=1) as the light flooded in 
from the outside (visual=1). Blue and yellow are predominant in my mind (visual=1).  
The gardens (place=1) were beautiful (cognition=1) and felt so lush (cognition=1). I 

213 
 
 
remember crouching down (kinaestehic=1) and telling my son (social interaction=1) 
that I was looking at a bridge which I had wanted to see since I was a little girl 
(cognition). It felt so much more special (emotion=1) because I was able to share it with 
him (social interaction=1). 
The fragment in its entirety clearly refers to a specific moment, and so is coded as a 
specific memory; also coded as ‘self-defining’, as this moment represents something 
that the participant had thought about over her life-time up to this point, when she 
finally saw the object of her recurring thoughts.

Parliament Hill Lido: Audio Guide 
Henry Grant took this photo in the heatwave of June 1957. It shows children playing in 
the Parliament Hill Lido in North London.  
In this photo, Henry Grant displays his enthusiasm for photographing children enjoying 
their environment. Some children are playing with the spray from a standpipe at the 
edge of the pool, and others are in the shallow water of the lido.  
The Lido was opened on 20 August, 1938, in the decade when lidos were the height of 
fashion and enjoying their heyday. The construction of lidos was part of a government 
initiative to improve the nation’s health, especially that of the working classes. Between 
1930 and 1939 at least 180 lidos were built in Britain. This lido was designed by Harry 
Rowbotham and TL Smithson, who were architects working for London County 
Council. They designed all of the city’s lidos between 1906 and 1939. It cost £34,000 to 
construct, making it the most expensive of the lidos built in London in the 1920s and 
30s. 
By 1957, when this photo was taken, the Lido had been open for nearly 20 years and 
had survived a direct hit in the Blitz. On 13 September 1940, incendiary bombs caused 
seventeen local fires, and the last one fell on the lido. The fire brigade managed to 
extinguish the blaze and keep the lido open. 
Since Henry Grant took this photo, the lido has continued to survive despite the gradual 
decline of lidos across the UK. In 1976, a young boy lost his life there, which resulted 
in increased numbers of staff and the removal of most of the diving boards. The final 
board was taken away in 2003. 
The lido underwent a major refurbishment in 2005 and remains open today, with the 
addition of a stainless-steel liner which is said to give the water an extra shimmer. It is 
acclaimed as an Art Deco classic and was Grade II-listed in 2009. Measuring 61 by 27 
meters, it is a large pool which is packed with families on warm days, and is popular 
with triathletes in training. 
Parliament Hill Lido: AD: 
Henry Grant took this photo in the heatwave of June 1957. It shows children playing in 
the Parliament Hill Lido in North London.  
A small section of the shallow end of the lido is captured in the photo. We stand, with 
Grant, at the water’s edge, surveying the scene. Water is to our left, and tarmac to our 
right, with the edge of the lido leading up from the base of the picture. This forms a line 
dividing the action of the photo. 
To the right, are two boys and a girl, all about 10 years old. They appear half way up the 
photo, standing on the poolside tarmac which looks rough under their bare feet. They 
crowd around a standpipe which sends a jet of water spraying into the lido. The two 
boys are in front of the girl, closest to the pipe, and their wet hair is plastered against 

220 
 
 
their foreheads. They are wearing plain dark swimming trunks. One boy has his hand in 
the jet of water, forcing it up and over his playmates in the pool. A girl in a plain dark 
swimming costume stands behind him. Her right hand is on the boy’s back as she 
reaches past him, jostling for position at the source of the stream of water.   
To the left, are around 12 children of similar age, girls and boys, ankle deep in the lido. 
They run towards the roaring spray of water. It forms an arch and patters like heavy 
rainfall as it cascades into the pool. They raise their arms and stretch out their hands to 
feel the force of the cool water as it batters against their faces. 
In the foreground is a young boy about 3 or 4 paces away from us. He stands still, ankle 
deep, drawing his shoulders up towards his ears, holding his arms away from his sides. 
His body is tense, his rib cage showing, as if the coldness of the water has caused a 
sharp intake of breath. Exhilarated, a broad grin spreads across his face as he glances 
past the camera. 
The photo has been taken with the camera angled towards the ground. The sky line is 
high and the clear, cloudless sky takes up only the top fifth of the photo. The horizon 
line is made up of a row of terraced houses and, in front of them, three elm trees in leaf. 
By the time this photo was taken, the Lido had been open for 19 years. Lidos were at 
their height in the 1930s, as a result of a government drive to improve the health of the 
working classes. It was built by Harry Rowbotham and TL Smithson, who were 
architects for London Country Council. The Lido cost £34,000 to construct, making it 
the most expensive of the city’s lidos built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Lido is still 
open to swimmers today. It survives despite the decline of lidos across the UK, and its 
own turbulent history. It took a direct hit in the Blitz of 1940 and a young boy lost his 
life there in 1976. It has since undergone major changes. These include the removal of 
diving boards and the addition of a stainless-steel liner, which is said to give the water 
an extra shimmer. The lido is acclaimed as an Art Deco classic and was Grade II-listed 
in 2009. Measuring 61 by 27 meters, it is a large pool which is packed with families on 
warm days, and is popular with triathletes in training. 
Eels at Chapel Street Market: AG 
Henry Grant took this photo in 1955, at Chapel Street Market, which sold textiles, food, 
hardware and jewellery. It shows the eel stall. 
In this photo, there is a market trader with his large tubs of live eels in water. People 
walk past in the background. The trader has positioned himself outside a shop selling 
cooked eels. 
Grant was drawn to market scenes for the buzz of activity and the characters that he 
found there. Markets also provided the opportunity to photograph great British 
traditions. This was attractive to Grant, as it provided good potential for ‘stock’ imagery 
which showcased iconic London scenes. Stock imagery would be reprinted more 
frequently due to editorial demand, and so could increase his earnings. 
Chapel Street market was open seven days a week. People bought the eels to cook at 
home, once the stall trader had dispatched them with a knife, as he is doing here. As 

221 
 
 
well as being sold for cooking at home, eels were also sold ready to eat. There were two 
businesses on Chapel Street selling hot stewed eels, both in the name of Manze. (pron: 
Mans) Eels were served alongside meat pie and mashed potato. The consumption of 
eels in London can be traced back far earlier than the 1950s, when this photo was taken. 
References to eels as food can be found from Shakespearian to Victorian times. Eels 
were said to have helped feed London during the Great Fire in 1666, when they were 
brought from the Netherlands in huge quantities to help meet demand. The popularity of 
eels was due to the fact that they were cheap and plentiful. Whereas other meat and fish 
had to be preserved in salt, eels could be kept alive in puddles of water until required. 
Today, the consumption of this traditional working class food has declined dramatically. 
This has been attributed to changing tastes and the scarcity of the eel. However, 
Manze’s still exists today on Tower Bridge Road. Dating from 1908, it is now the oldest 
surviving eel shop. For Grant in 1955, however, a teeming mass of eels would have 
been a striking, even if commonplace sight in London’s bustling market scenes. 
Eels at Chapel Street Market: AD 
Henry Grant took this photo in 1955, at Chapel Street Market, which sold textiles, food, 
hardware and jewellery. It shows an eel stall. 
We stand with Grant at the stall, facing the market trader, who doesn’t seem to have 
seen us yet. Between him and us, two large rectangular tubs of eels span the base of the 
photo. The tubs are filled nearly to the top with a mass of seething, black eels squirming 
over one another with their smooth, muscular bodies.  The trader stands in the centre, a 
set of weighing scales to the right of him and a cash register to the left. In his 30s, he 
has short dark wavy hair, parted to the side and slicked back away from his face. He 
wears a jacket with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, a stained apron of thick material 
tied around his waist. In front of him is a heavy wooden block. His right hand holds a 
sharp knife, about as long as his forearm. His finger points down the handle to direct the 
blade, which rests in contact with the block. He has just used it to cut up an eel. His left 
hand holds the stump of the eel’s body, with sticky blood oozing out of its centre. He 
looks down at the knife, fully absorbed in his task. His right shoulder is angled 
backwards, away from the knife and the eel. Perhaps he is trying to avoid being 
spattered with blood. 
Behind him, the motion of the passing street scene fills the rest of the frame with no sky 
visible. A shopfront frames the market trader, with the capitalised text ‘HOT STEWED 
EELS’ clearly captured by Grant. Two passers-by, out of focus, walk from left to right. 
One man, on the left side, is smartly dressed in a suit. He walks by, looking straight 
ahead. In front of him, a blond woman in her 30s walks past, wearing a checked jacket. 
She turns her face towards us, in a blur of motion. Perhaps the photographer has caught 
her attention as she hurries by. 
Markets were a favourite location for Grant with their bustling activity, characters and 
traditions. They also provided ample opportunity for ‘stock imagery’ of iconic London 
scenes, which had greater earning potential for the photographer.  
On Chapel Street, eels were sold by Manze, a business which still exists today on Tower 
Bridge Road. Open since 1908, it is now one of the oldest surviving shops to sell the 

222 
 
 
traditional working class food of eels, pie and mash. Eels had a long tradition as a cheap 
and plentiful food that dated back to Shakespearian times, and even helped feed London 
during the Great Fire of 1666.  In recent times, the British taste for eels has declined 
dramatically. But for Grant in 1955, a teeming mass of eels would have been a striking, 
even if commonplace sight in London’s bustling market scenes. 
Irwin Clement Steel Band: AG: 
Henry Grant took this photo in May 1964. It shows the Irwin Clement Steel Band 
playing at Stalbridge Street, in Lisson Grove, in London. 
A man dancing the limbo has removed his shoes to allow him to pass beneath a low bar. 
Steel band music and the limbo are popular in the Caribbean, especially in Trinidad, and 
have developed out of African music and dance. The first steel band played in London 
in 1951, when the Trinidad All-Steel Percussion Orchestra presented the newly-
invented steelpan to an international audience. 
Steel pans are made from industrial waste, such as car parts, paint pots, dustbins, oil 
drums and biscuit tins. A series of dents hammered into the shiny metal surface create a 
range of different notes, according to their position and size. The pans can be stationary, 
or slung around the players’ necks so they can be played as the musicians walk, as a 
marching band. 
The players in this photo are not identified , but we know that Irwin Clement began his 
career as a pannist with Dem Boys of Belmont in 1952. He migrated to the UK in the 
early 1960s where, in addition to being a pannist, he became a percussionist. He played 
for many years with the Russ Henderson Steel ensemble and travelled extensively as an 
accompanist to many prominent artists. Whilst he continued to be based in London, his 
profession took him to many countries in Europe, Asia, southern Africa and Australia. 
In recent times Clement has been a frequent visitor to Tobago where he has a home. At 
80 years of age, “Clem” continues to be an active pannist and percussionist.  
This photo was taken a few months before the first Notting Hill Carnival, which began 
in 1964. Russ Henderson is recognised as one of its founders. Henry Grant did not 
photograph the Notting Hill Carnival, but he did photograph street musicians all over 
London. He also documented the transformation of London following African-
Caribbean migration, marked by the arrival of the passenger ship the Empire Windrush 
in June 1948. He captured this social change through photographs of employment, 
political demonstrations, music and culture. 
Irwin Clement Steel Band: AD: 
Henry Grant took this photo in May 1964. It shows the Irwin Clement Steel Band 
playing at Stalbridge Street, in Lisson Grove, in London. 
They are playing music on steel pans and bongos, and a man is dancing the limbo. Steel 
band music and the limbo are popular in the Caribbean, especially in Trinidad. Steel 
pans are made from industrial waste materials, and give out a range of notes from dents 
hammered into their surface. 

223 
 
 
The limbo dancer is the focal point of the photo. He has removed his smooth black slip-
on shoes, which are paired neatly on the road next to him. His legs are splayed out in 
front of him as he draws his body under the limbo bar, feet first. His back is parallel to 
the road and his knees just inches above its surface. The posture of his body looks as 
though it would be impossible to sustain a moment longer. We imagine the burning 
sensation in his legs as the tension builds and the roughness of the road felt through his 
socks. His hands are flung up for balance, fingers spread, as he inches his weight under 
the bar. Behind him, three band members stand with their large round steel pans, which 
weigh heavily on the back of their necks, where the straps rest. The outermost men 
appear to be of Caribbean origin and are smartly dressed with shirts, black trousers and 
smooth black slip-on shoes. The central pannist is the only white member of the group. 
The fourth band member is playing the bongo which is clamped between his knees.  He 
is squatting on the kerb, at eye level with the limbo bar. The rhythmic thuds of the 
bongo intermingle with the tones of the pans, perhaps building to a crescendo to 
encourage the dancer.  All four men are smiling at the limbo dancer and the leftmost 
man is tapping his foot. At the far left hand side of the image, a young white boy stands 
watching with his arms folded. His stance gives nothing away and we wonder what he 
thinks of what he sees. 
Grant held the camera at waist height to take this photograph, which puts us on eye 
level with the limbo bar. The band are playing on the pavement, just a few paces away 
from Grant, with the limbo dancer in the road in front of them. The limbo bar consists 
of two vertical posts, with a horizontal pole balanced across them. The posts have pegs 
at intervals that allow the pole to be lowered. The bar juts out into the road, at a 45-
degree angle to the pavement. In the background, there’s a line of wrought iron railings 
behind the band, and brick buildings fill the rest of the frame with no sky visible. We 
can make out the street sign for ‘Stalbridge Street’ to the right, fixed to the railings, 
although it is partially obscured by one of the four band members. 
The players in this photograph are not identified, but we know that Irwin Clement 
migrated to the UK in the early 1960s when his career as a pannist and percussionist 
took him around the world. He also played alongside other well-known artists, such as 
Russ Henderson. Henderson was one of the founders of the Notting Hill Carnival, 
which began in the months after this photograph was taken. Grant did not photograph 
the Notting Hill Carnival, but he did photograph street musicians all over London. He 
documented the transformation of London following African-Caribbean migration, 
marked by the arrival of the passenger ship the Empire Windrush in June 1948. He 
captured this social change through photographs of employment, political 
demonstrations, music and culture. 
Highbury Quadrant Infants School: AG 
Henry Grant took this photo in December 1964. It’s called ‘Pupils at Highbury 
Quadrant Infants School.’  It shows a crowd of schoolchildren, around 60 or so, running 
across the playground towards the photographer. 
The low-rise pre-fab buildings of Highbury Quadrant Infants School contrast with the 
imposing and ornate semi-detached villas behind. The school itself was opened in 1956 
by Countess Atlee. 9 years later, this photograph was taken close to Christmas when the 

224 
 
 
children were rehearsing their Nativity play, which Grant photographed separately. 
Here, Grant has directed the children to run towards him. He has positioned the camera 
at waist level, or perhaps even lower to the ground, so the children are at eye level as 
they approach. A few black children can be seen amongst the crowd of mainly white 
faces. This reflects the increasing numbers of Caribbean families coming to London in 
the post-war years. A teacher or dinner lady is also seen amongst the crowd. This photo 
was taken in midwinter, and the children are wearing jumpers and winter coats, but 
many of the boys are still in schoolboy shorts. 
Grant was a committed socialist, and his pictures often contain a layer of social 
comment. He was a passionate believer in education as a vehicle for social change. He 
worked in partnership with his wife Rose, a journalist. Together, they covered a wide-
ranging spectrum of events and subjects within London. These included welfare, the 
NHS, Housing, construction developments, famous events and landmarks, youth culture 
and schools. In the 1950s, with a child of their own, they became increasingly focused 
on schools and the education system. This took Grant into the classroom, from special 
needs schools and nurseries through to secondary schools and universities. Grant 
produced thousands of photographs of schools and school children. He and Rose were 
particularly interested in new approaches in education, such as the first comprehensives. 
A great deal of Grant’s work, including this photo, appeared in the Times Educational 
Supplement, and chronicled developments in education. 
In Grant’s work in schools, many of the shots were taken in playgrounds, where the 
children can be seen skipping, hula hooping, running and jumping. These photographs, 
and this one among them, demonstrate Grant’s ability to work with school children and 
to capture their natural exuberance. 
Highbury Quadrant Infants School: AD 
Henry Grant took this photo in December 1964. It’s called ‘Pupils at Highbury 
Quadrant Infants School.’  It shows a crowd of schoolchildren, around 60 or so, 
charging across the playground towards the photographer.  
We stand with Grant, facing the children, who are thundering across the playground 
towards us. The school buildings are approximately 30-40 metres away and the crowd 
of school children spreads out between us and the buildings - the nearest boy will reach 
us in just a second or two. The children closest to us are about 7 or 8 years old and 
there’s a mix of girls and boys, with a few black children reflecting the increasing 
number of Caribbean families moving to London in the post-war years.  There is a 
female teacher or dinner lady in the crowd, and the younger children are staying close to 
her. She seems very fixed and dour compared to the excited children. The three nearest 
boys capture our attention. The nearest child is on the left side of the photograph, and 
takes up just over half its height as he is just a pace or two away from Grant. He is 
winning the race to the photographer by a clear margin. Like many of the boys in the 
photograph, he wears a winter jumper and his coat is flapping open, and he has bare 
legs in schoolboy shorts. The wind whistles past his ears and the cold air must feel 
biting on his face and legs as he charges towards Grant. The other two boys head the 
rest of the crowd and are approximately in the centre of the photograph. All three of 
these boys are looking directly at Grant with broad smiles on their faces. They also have 

225 
 
 
both feet, blurred with motion, completely clear of the ground as they sprint towards us.  
We can imagine the thuds of their feet and their whoops of delight as they surge 
forwards. 
Grant held the camera low to the ground to capture this image. Only a thin sliver of sky 
is present, as the majority of the photograph is taken up by the tarmac of the 
playground. Apart from the children, the playground itself is completely empty, except 
for a solitary leafless tree on the far-right hand side. Behind the children are the low rise 
pre-fab school buildings, with their large windows, which frame the playground. On a 
nearby street overlooking the school, rise two sets of imposing and ornate semi-
detached villas, across the left half of the photograph. They form a contrast with the 
more modern school buildings below.

Sailing Model Boats: AG 
Henry Grant took this photo sometime in the 1950s. It shows a middle-aged man 
launching a model boat, the R.A.F. Rescue Launch 141, on the waters of the Round 
Pond in Kensington Palace Gardens. 
The Round Pond was created in 1730 by George II. It is around seven acres in area, 
measuring approximately 200 by 150 metres. It is up to 5 metres deep in places. Despite 
its name, it is not circular, but rectangular with stepped and rounded corners. It is home 
to a variety of wildlife, including fish, ducks, geese, swans and other birds, all of whom 
are regularly fed by visitors. Kensington Gardens and the Round Pond were first opened 
to the public in 1830, to visitors who were deemed to be ‘respectfully dressed.’ The 
Round Pond very quickly became popular for the sailing of model yachts. In 1876, the 
Model Yacht Sailing Association was founded. It is still active today, making it the 
oldest model sailing club in the UK. It has met many challenges in its sailing history, 
including a period in the 1880s when the pond was drained, and some further disruption 
in the same decade due to pondweed. The club suffered greatly after the First World 
War, when membership went down, but it gradually recovered its popularity and status. 
In 1937, a section of the pond was railed off to create a paddling pool for children. 
However, this met with fierce resistance and the rails were removed a year later. 

226 
 
 
In the 1950s, when Grant took this photograph, people crowded around the Round Pond 
to watch model boats race around the water, such as this R.A.F. Rescue Launch 141. 
The R.A.F. models were based on the marine boats used in the Second World War to 
rescue airmen who had fallen into the sea. Today, the club continues to face challenges 
from pressures on parkland space and boathouse accommodation, and the sailing is still 
periodically halted due to pondweed. However, club members still gather on most 
Sundays throughout the year to race their collection of vintage and classic model boats 
and yachts.  
Sailing Model Boats: AD 
Henry Grant took this photo sometime in the 1950s.  It shows a middle-aged man 
launching a model boat on the waters of the Round Pond in Kensington Palace Gardens. 
The focal point of this photo is the miniature R.A.F. Rescue Launch 141. Its 
streamlined, graceful form cuts through the water of the Round Pond, its colour dark in 
contrast. Water splashes up against its bow. It has been launched from the left side of 
the photo, and a bubbling trail in its wake crosses over two thirds of its width. On the 
far left-hand side, the man who launched it follows its progress with a look of 
concentration. He crouches at the water’s edge, just a couple of metres away from 
Grant. About 40 years old, he wears dark trousers and a thick coat. The collar is pulled 
up to protect his neck from the wind, which lifts his hair. His left arm is outstretched, 
having just pushed the boat into the water, dipping his hand into the cold water in the 
process. The boat itself is about the length of the man’s forearm. 
Grant might have crouched down to take the photo, as his subject is doing, as the 
camera has been held close to ground level. The man’s smart black lace-up shoes are 
roughly half way up the photo, and he balances his weight on the concrete at the water’s 
edge. Small waves lapping at the shore threaten to soak his feet. Behind him, two 
children on the edge of the frame capture our attention as they peer over his shoulder to 
watch the boat’s progress. One of them, a boy around 10 years old, wears a school boy 
cap and round glasses.  Behind them, the water’s edge divides the photo in half. It is 
lined with many small figures of other spectators, who appear in the far distance. 
Behind them rise the trees of the Gardens. Their bare branches suggest that the model 
sailing enthusiasts are braving cold and wintry weather to enjoy their hobby. 
Created in 1730 by George II, the Round Pond measures approximately seven acres in 
area, and 200 by 150 metres. It is up to 5 metres deep in places, and it is actually 
rectangular with rounded corners. It is home to fish and a variety of waterbirds. First 
opened to ‘respectfully dressed’ visitors in 1830, the Pond quickly became popular with 
model yacht enthusiasts and the Model Yacht Sailing Association was founded in 1876. 
The club is still active today, despite a history of challenges. Draining of the pond, 
pondweed and space given over to children have all temporarily halted sailing.  The 
club’s membership numbers also suffered after the First World War, but it gradually 
recovered its popularity and status. 
In the 1950s, people raced RAF models based on the marine boats used in the Second 
World War to rescue stricken airmen. Today, club members face on-going pressures on 

227 
 
 
boathouse accommodation and battles with pondweed, but they still gather most 
Sundays to race vintage and classic models. 
Feeding the Pigeons: AG 
Henry Grant took this photo in November 1954. It shows a young boy feeding pigeons 
in Trafalgar Square. 
Feeding the pigeons was a London tourist attraction for many decades. The construction 
of Trafalgar Square started in the 1830s, and it was already known for its large number 
of pigeons by the time building finished in 1844. Feed sellers soon established 
themselves there, selling bags of seed to visitors throughout the Victorian era. Feeding 
the pigeons soon became a quintessential London pastime among all social classes.  
The National Portrait Gallery exhibited a series of photos taken around Trafalgar 
Square, including one of Elizabeth Taylor being mobbed by pigeons. The last licensed 
bird feed vendor on Trafalgar Square was Bernard Rayner, whose family sold feed in 
the square for half a century. He was forced to leave in 2001 when the then Mayor of 
London, Ken Livingstone, decided to ban licensed feed sellers in the area. The local 
authorities were concerned that the birds’ acidic droppings were damaging Nelson’s 
Column and they started to install anti-pigeon wires and spikes. Westminster City 
Council extended the ban on feeding the pigeons to a wider area in 2007, and imposed a 
£500 fine on anyone who disregarded the new bylaws. Harris hawks were also brought 
in to patrol the Square and scare the pigeons away. 
Feeding the pigeons was also popular on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral. This was 
immortalised in the now iconic Feed the Birds song in the Disney film Mary Poppins. 
The song shows the Bird Woman sitting on the Cathedral steps selling crumbs for 
tuppence a bag. Today, visitors are encouraged not to feed the pigeons on the steps, but 
many come to have their photo taken in the same spot as the Bird Woman, and the 
Cathedral shop continues to sell a number of Feed the Birds inspired gifts. 
Henry Grant took many photos of this popular pastime. In this one, some of the major 
landmarks of Trafalgar Square can be seen, including the National Gallery and one of 
the Sir Edwin Landseer lions. The young boy feeding the pigeons is wearing his school 
blazer. He typifies Grant’s delight in capturing London and its scenes through the eyes 
of young people. 
Feeding the Pigeons: AD 
Henry Grant took this photo in November 1954. It shows a boy feeding pigeons in 
Trafalgar Square. 
A young boy, about twelve, stands stock still, tense, and looks past Grant, his mouth 
half open in an awkward smile. Just a metre or so in front of us, slightly to the right of 
centre, he holds out his hands. The thick material of his dark school blazer pulls tight at 
his elbows. With a whoosh of beating wings, blurry with motion, two pigeons swoop 
and settle on his bare hands. Their feet and claws are sharp on his skin and their wings 
waft air towards his face. A bird perches on his right sleeve, and another sits on his left 
upper arm. Unsure, the boy draws his shoulders up and pulls his chin down into his 

228 
 
 
chest, his tie tight around his neck. Another bird sits in profile, on his head, surveying 
the scene. Its dark grey colour contrasts with the boy’s close-cut fair hair and the bright 
sun casts the bird’s shadow on the side of his face, above his ear. Its feet are sharp 
through his hair. If it moves, its tail feathers will brush against the side of his face.  
From the pocket of his blazer, just in frame, to the pigeon on his head, our unsure 
subject forms a central column of interest, taking up most of the photo’s height. Behind 
him, men mill about in Trafalgar Square, in dark overcoats, some wearing caps. Pigeons 
move busily between them, casting shadows on this bright day. One of the Sir Edwin 
Landseer lion statues, larger-than-life, juts into the shot from the left. Raised on its 
plinth, it peers over the people, its paws level with their heads. It looks regally, in 
profile, towards the National Gallery. The Gallery’s ornate lantern and pillars are just a 
blurred suggestion above the head of our boy and the men behind him. Grant has 
focused his camera entirely on the young boy in the foreground. We think he is 
enjoying himself despite his uncertainty. 
Feeding the pigeons was a popular London pastime and tourist attraction for many 
decades, from the 1830s when Trafalgar Square was first built. It has been immortalised 
in popular culture.  Elizabeth Taylor was photographed being mobbed by pigeons in 
Trafalgar Square, and the photo was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery. 
In the Disney film Mary Poppins, the iconic Feed the Birds song showed the Bird 
Woman feeding the pigeons on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral, and selling bags of 
crumbs for tuppence. 
The last licensed bird feed vendor on Trafalgar Square was Bernard Rayner, whose 
family sold feed in the square for half a century. He was forced to leave in 2001 when

2007, and imposed a £500 fine on anyone who disregarded the new bylaws. Harris 
hawks were also brought in to patrol the Square and scare the pigeons away. 
However, in the 1950s, feeding the birds was still a popular pastime. The young boy 
photographed here typifies Grant’s delight in capturing London and its scenes through 
the eyes of young people. 
Street Busker: AG 
Henry Grant took this photo in 1952. It shows a one-man band performing to the 
crowds outside Woolworth’s in Camden Town. 
The photo was taken at the corner of Camden High Street and Delancey Street, where a 
crowd has gathered to listen to the busker. He is wearing a large bass drum on his back, 
with cymbals attached, but at the moment the photo was taken, he appears to be playing 
a wind instrument, perhaps a soprano sax. 
The history of the one-man band in London goes back over 100 years before Henry 
Grant took this photo, at least as far as Victorian London. A watercolour painting by 

229 
 
 
George Scharf from the 1820s shows a one-man band on the Strand. The man plays 
panpipes fastened around his neck and beats a bass drum and tambourine which are 
slung over his shoulders. The one-man band was later immortalized in popular culture, 
8 years after Grant’s photo, in the Disney film Mary Poppins. Dick van Dyke plays 
Bert, a one-man band who entertains the crowds in Edwardian London. 
Behind the listening crowd in Grant’s photo, we can make out a pub, possibly the 
Brighton, and Woolworth’s. In its heyday, a Woolworth’s shop was a feature of every 
British high street. Woolworth’s was the retail phenomenon of the twentieth century. 
The mass-market shop sold factory-made goods at rock bottom prices. It has its roots in 
the US, as the original five-and-dime store, where all goods were priced at either 5 or 10 
cents. It quickly went global, building to more than 3,000 near-identical stores across 
the world.  
Part of its magic was an ability to fit into different local communities without 
sacrificing its identity. Shoppers in the UK considered 'Woolies' as British as fish and 
chips, while Americans continued to call the chain 'the five-and-ten' more than sixty 
years after other, more expensive lines of merchandise were added. 
In the 1950s, Woolworth’s boasted a shop in virtually every parade across the British 
Isles and the Republic of Ireland. The shops were known for their bright and shiny 
appearance and loyal customer following. The shops changed very little over the years, 
except for stocking many more expensive items. However, the chain could not survive 
the financial crisis of 2008 and it went from normal trading in 800 stores to complete 
shutdown in just 41 days. 
For Grant in 1952, ‘Woolies’ would have been the quintessential British shop, making 
for a typical high street scene. The one-man band was also iconic. When Grant archived 
this photograph, he stored it alongside images of chair makers and market traders, 
labelled collectively as ‘London Types’.  
Street Busker: AD 
Henry Grant took this photo in 1952. It shows a one-man band performing to the 
crowds outside Woolworth’s in Camden. 
In profile, a busker lifts a wind instrument, perhaps a soprano sax, to his lips, ready to 
entertain the waiting crowd. He leans towards his audience, to counterbalance the 
weight of a large bass drum, positioned uncomfortably on his back. Thick straps pass 
over his shoulders and under his arms to hold the drum in place. This drum has a 
smaller drum and cymbals lashed to its side.  More ropes pull taught between the 
instruments on his back and his feet, where they loop around his scruffy black leather 
boots. The slightest movement he makes will result in a crash or jangle of instruments. 
The bass drum is large enough to have a loud, deep tone, enough to be heard despite the 
chatter of the crowd. 
Only a small part of the man’s face is visible, but he may be in his 40s, and he has a 
dishevelled appearance. He wears dark clothing, maybe overalls, which finish mid shin 
where they meet his thick woollen socks and boots. His only smart article of clothing is 

230 
 
 
his black top hat. It is pushed firmly down on his head and gives him a dapper 
appearance, despite the scruffy clothes. 
The busker’s audience stands in a semicircle on the pavement, just a step up from his 
position in the road. The kerb stretches from the bottom right of the photo, in a strong 
diagonal line, finishing just under half way up on the left side. 30-40 people have 
gathered to hear him play. They are warmly dressed in winter coats, and the men wear 
ties. On the left side of the photo, some shoppers wait to cross the road, paying little 
attention to Grant or the busker. On the right side, closer to us, spectators smile directly 
at the busker. Two of them are young boys of about 8, whose bare legs show between 
their woollen socks and winter coats. Their hands are pushed down into their coat 
pockets for warmth. The busker has their full attention. 
Behind the crowd, buildings at the corner of Camden High Street and Delancey Street 
rise to fill the rest of the frame, with very little sky visible. The building on the left side 
of the photo is a pub, possibly ‘the Brighton’ although some of its letters are obscured 
by traffic lights. A smart shopfront, with two large protruding glass windows, takes up 
about one third of the photo’s width on the right side. Above the door, the name 
‘F.W.Woolworth’s’ in capital letters. 
Woolworth’s was a high-street presence across the UK in the 1950s. The brand came 
from the US, where it was known as a ‘five and dime’ store, selling cheap items. The 
chain grew internationally but was known for its ability to fit into local communities. 
Shoppers in the UK considered ‘Woolies’ as British as fish and chips. The store 
disappeared from British High Streets after the financial crisis of 2008. For Grant in the 
1950s, it would have been part of a typically British high street scene. 
The one-man band was also a typical London sight for Grant. These single buskers, 
carrying and playing an array of musical instruments, had been entertaining London 
since at least Victorian times. An 1820s painting by George Scharf shows a one-man 
band on the Strand. The one-man band would go on to be immortalised in popular 
culture through the character of Bert in the Disney film Mary Poppins. This was 
released 8 years after Grant’s photo. For Grant in 1952, the one-man band was iconic 
enough for him to file this photo, alongside other images of chair makers and market 
traders, under the category of ‘London types.’  
Tower Beach: AG 
Henry Grant took this photo in 1952. It shows Londoners relaxing on the artificially 
created Tower Beach, which was next to the Tower of London. 
Tower Beach was a popular day-trip destination, especially for children and adults from 
the East End. 1500 tonnes of sand were added to the shingly foreshore at Tower Hill to 
create a beach holiday atmosphere. The beach officially opened on 23rd July, 1934. King 
George V promised that the children of London would have ‘free access for ever’.  In 
the 1930s over 500,000 people dipped their toes in the water of London’s very own 
seaside. 
In many ways, the experience came very close to the real thing. The tides came and 
went just as they did on the coast, and children could build sandcastles whilst their 

231 
 
 
parents relaxed in deck-chairs. Toffee-apple sellers and entertainers sold their wares just 
as they did at Brighton or Southend. Visitors could paddle, swim or even hire a rowing 
boat. It cost 3 shillings to take a trip under Tower Bridge and back again. A boatman 
was posted on duty to look out for adventurous children getting into difficulties. When 
people had tired of the beach, they could visit the Tower of London, which was free for 
children. 
The beach was closed during the Second World War but reopened again in 1946 and 
thrived throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It finally closed in 1971 due to public concern 
about the water quality of the Thames. 
London’s iconic Tower Bridge appears in the background in this image, with its 
distinctive towers in Victorian Gothic style, and the walkways between them. 
The photo is typical of Grant’s work in many ways. He sought out iconic London 
scenes, and he frequently photographed social leisure scenes. Children at play in their 
city form a regular theme throughout his work. He also had an ability to document 
scenes that seem in some way historic, scenes that may not last, just as this one did not. 
The composition of the photo is split in half diagonally with the scattering of figures on 
the beach on one half and the dominant, famous Tower Bridge on the other. Today, now 
that the riverfront looks so different, this almost feels like two separate scenes 
conjoined: Tower Bridge and the seaside. 
Tower Beach: AD 
Henry Grant took this photo in 1952. It shows Londoners relaxing on the artificially 
created Tower Beach, which was next to the Tower of London. 
A little girl picks her way across the sand at Tower Beach, on this bright summer’s day. 
With her back to us, feet just out of frame, she is in the centre of the photo, just a pace 
or two away from Grant. Maybe 5 or 6 years old, she wears a knitted swimming 
costume, straps cross at the back. Her blond hair is neatly parted and pulled tightly into 
plaits which are pinned to the side of her head. No hair escapes from this neat style and 
the nape of her neck and her back are completely exposed to the sun, which warms her 
skin. 
She and Grant survey the scene. Crowds of people sit, stand or stroll.  Children in 
swimming costumes or shorts are barefoot on the coarse sand. It is rough under their 
bare feet, especially close the river, where it turns to shingle. They call to one another as 
they play and explore the beach. People’s shadows fall in long dark stripes across the 
sand, suggesting a warm summer’s afternoon. One man moves away from Grant, 
pushing a bike over the sand. Another man, closer, sits facing the river reading a 
newspaper. His dark suit jacket and trousers are formal and restrictive and must be 
uncomfortably warm on this sunny July day. 
The diagonal line of the shore cuts through the photo, punctuated by people walking 
along it or paddling in the water. One young boy stands thigh deep in the water, several 
metres away from the shoreline. He is far enough into the river to be wading in deeper, 
colder water. Beyond him, the iconic form of Tower Bridge rises against the bright sky. 
The bridge deck forms a strong horizontal line just above the river, spanning the entire 

232 
 
 
photo. Tower Bridge itself takes up the rightmost half of the photo where it juts into the 
sky, the details of its ornate Victorian Gothic style on display. Its towers, their roofs 
(rooves tbc) a cluster of turrets, are at right and centre. 4 stories of windows on the 
towers face over the river. At the level of the highest window, walkways join the 
towers. Parallel to the walkways, the old wharves of Bermondsey, very small in the 
distance, extend across the width of the photo. The silhouettes of cranes rise in the far 
distance. 
Tower Beach was created in 1934 by adding 1500 tonnes of sand to the shingly 
foreshore of the River Thames at Tower Hill. King George V promised that the children 
of London would have ‘free access for ever’, and the beach was very popular with 
families from the East End. The beach came close to the real sea-side experience, with 
toffee-apple sellers, deck-chair men and entertainers. Visitors could paddle, build sand-
castles or even hire a rowing boat for a trip under Tower Bridge and back, for the price 
of three shillings. The nearby Tower of London was free for children too. 
The beach was closed during the Second World War, but reopened again in 1946 and 
thrived throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It finally closed in 1971 due to public concern 
about the water quality of the Thames. 
This photo reveals Grant’s enjoyment in capturing iconic London scenes through the 
eyes of young people. It also shows his ability to document historic scenes that were 
transient, just as this one was. The composition of the photo is split in half diagonally, 
with the scattering of figures on the beach on one half and the dominant, famous Tower 
Bridge on the other. Today, now that the riverfront looks so different, this photo almost 
feels like two separate scenes conjoined: Tower Bridge and the seaside. 
Wolf Cubs: AG 
Henry Grant took this photo in March 1954. It shows 20 boys in Wolf Cub uniform 
having a picnic on the grass. A single girl is among them. The Albert Memorial is in the 
background. Queen Victoria opened the memorial in 1872 to commemorate her 
husband. The statue of Prince Albert within it was added three years later. 
In the 1950s, when Grant took this photo, Wolf Cub membership was at its peak. But 
Wolf Cubs were not part of Baden-Powell’s original concept for scouting. The scheme 
was never meant for boys below the age of 12. However, younger boys were keen to 
participate and would join older brothers and friends at Scout meetings. By 1913 the 
younger element was seen as a problem and it was clear that something would have to 
be done. Wolf cubs was created for boys aged 7-11. 
Baden-Powell and Sir Percy Everett, of the Headquarters Committee, corresponded at 
length to work out details of the age of admittance, uniform, and tests for the first Stars.  
The Stars were awarded on completion of activities from four activity areas, and were 
worn on the side of the cap. The wolf cubs were given the official go ahead in January 
1914. By the end of the first year, there were 30,000 wolf cub scouts. 
The world’s first international Scout Jamboree was held at Olympia in August 1920, 
just around the corner from Kensington Gardens. It included wolf cubs. 

233 
 
 
Today, wolf cubs have been renamed cub scouts, and their numbers run into many 
millions worldwide. They are also no longer the youngest group. The Beavers have now 
taken their place. 
We don’t know anything about the Wolf Cubs in this photo. Perhaps they were 
Londoners, or boys visiting from elsewhere. Kensington Gardens would have been a 
convenient place to stop for lunch if they were visiting the Science or Natural History 
Museums nearby.  
This photo was a good opportunity for a stock image, especially considering the 
popularity of Wolf Cubs at this time. These images would be re-printed more frequently 
and could earn the photographer more money. 
Wolf Cubs: AD 
Henry Grant took this photo in March 1954. A group of twenty boys of about 7 or 8 
years old, sit, squat, kneel or stand on the grassy lawns of Kensington Gardens. If they 
were in an arrangement for the photo, then it is now collapsing. Some of the boys are 
looking in Grant’s direction, but most are engrossed in eating. Perhaps Grant saw this 
lunch stop as an opportunity for a photograph. 
The boys are all dressed in the peaked caps of the Wolf Cub uniform, blazers, shorts 
and knee high woollen socks. On the far right of the group, a boy with dark rimmed 
glasses sits legs akimbo, his lunch on a bag between them. He smiles slightly as he 
opens a paper packet, perhaps discovering his favourite sandwiches. Moving left, a boy 
with a mop of thick, dark, curly hair crams his lunch into his mouth, his eyes on Grant. 
In front of him, four more boys form an untidy front row. The rightmost boy lounges 
across the front of the group, eating, with his legs stretched out casually to the side. The 
grass must tickle his bare knees. To the left of him, also eating, two boys sit more 
sensibly with crossed legs. The leftmost boy in the front row of our group is falling 
backwards on a boy behind. His left hand clutches his packet of sandwiches and he 
breaks his fall with his right elbow. He sticks his tongue out and his eyebrows are 
pinched together, making him look slightly aggrieved. A thickset boy behind has a hand 
on his shoulder  - is he pulling him up, or did he push him down? On the far left hand 
side of the group, a little girl sits slightly apart, looking more composed in a dark coat 
and hat. To the right of her, a smooth dark leather handbag marks a space between her 
and the boys. Perhaps an adult has momentarily stepped away to help Grant attract the 
group’s attention. At the back of the group, one boy stands tall and is looking in the 
photographer’s direction. His peaked cap is pulled down to the side, just above his right 
eye, and his cub scarf stands out against his dark shirt. Behind him, a row of formally 
planted trees recedes to the skyline, which divides the photo in half. Bare branches 
stretch to the top of the frame and form an ever-fading silhouette against a dull sky. The 
fading trees in the distance and their bare branches suggest a cold day, fog even. In the 
far distance, right of the trees and just right of centre, rises the Albert Memorial, 
Albert’s statue in sombre profile. Its ornate and imposing form contrasts with the heap 
of hungry boys in the foreground. No broad grins for the camera this time. Perhaps the 
children are chilled sitting on the ground on this March day, or just too interested in 
their lunch to pay much attention to Grant.

By the time Grant took this photo in the 1950s, Wolf Cub Scout membership was at its 
peak. Younger members had not been part of Baden-Powell’s original plan for scouting, 
but pressure from younger siblings and Scout leaders resulted in the formation of Wolf 
Cubs, for boys aged 7-11. Wolf Cubs began in 1914 after a long correspondence 
between Baden-Powell and Sir Percy Everett of the Headquarters committee. They 
worked out details of age of admittance, uniform, and tests for the first Stars. These 
were badges that were worn on the side of the cap, and were given upon successful 
completion of activities.  
Today, Wolf Cubs have been renamed Cub Scouts, and the Beavers have taken their 
place as the youngest members.

Appendix 3.4: Time B questionnaire 
Sample time B questionnaire for the ADG or SAG group: 
 
Henry Grant Photo Exhibition: Follow Up Questionnaire  
 
Researcher: Rachel Hutchinson, in collaboration with Dr Alison Eardley, University of 
Westminster, and the Museum of London  
                     
Thank you again for participating in this research study on the Henry Grant Photo 
Exhibition.  
 
Now that it is approximately one month since you viewed the photos, we'd like to ask 
you a few questions about them. This should take about 20 minutes to complete. 
 
The questionnaire asks you to recall some details about the photos, and to share your 
opinions about them, and the audio guide you listened to. Some of the questions will be 
the same as before, and some will be different. Please do not worry about what you 
wrote last time, we want your thoughts today.  Some of your ratings/thoughts may be 
the same as before, some may be different. That is completely fine.  
 
    There is space for you to leave your email address if you would like an update on 
results of the study. The project has been approved by the University of Westminster 
Psychology Department ethics committee.  
 
    Questions about the Research 
 
    If you wish to contact the researcher, Rachel Hutchinson, after participation, please 
send an email to r.hutchinson@my.westminster.ac.uk                                  
 
Please enter your name here (everything you write here today will be subsequently 
anonymised and your personal data treated confidentially, this is just for us to match 
your responses to the questionnaire you completed previously)

In this section, we would like you to tell us what you remember about the Henry Grant 
photos. It does not need to be the order in which you viewed them. Any order is fine.  
    
For each photo that you remember, please tell us the title, or give a few words of your 
own to identify it. Then we would please like you to tell us any details that come into 
your mind as you think about it. This could be a person, building or other detail that you 
remember seeing in the photo, or it could be a particular piece of information, word or 
phrase that comes to mind as you remember the image.    
    
It might be clear to you, slightly hazy, or just a fragment of information, but that doesn't 
matter. Please list all the details that you can remember below.  We would really 
appreciate it if you could give as much information as you can.   
    
Don't worry if you can't remember all the photos. Please just fill in as much information 
as you can for those you do remember. We have provided space for you to give us 
details about all 9 photos, but you can click through the rest of these pages if you have 
filled in all you can.

Thank you very much for your participation in this research experiment.   
    
This study is exploring different ways of presenting information to museum visitors. In 
particular, we are keen to understand whether presenting audio information alongside 
artworks enhances visitors' experiences.    
    
In this study, we are comparing the presentation of photographs simply as they are, with 
minimal accompanying text, with the presentation of photographs with an audio guide. 
We are also testing two different kinds of audio guides. One is a standard guide, 
providing some factual and contextual information about the photo. The other is an 
audio descriptive guide, which also provides some facts and contextual information, but 
also describes the visual elements that can be seen in the photo. The audio descriptive 
guide draws upon techniques used for interpreting artworks for blind and partially 
sighted museum visitors.   
    
We are keen to understand which kind of presentation is most enjoyed by museum 
visitors, and whether this affects how people might connect to the artwork and what 
they might remember.   
    
If you would like any further information about the different kinds of presentations used 
here, please contact the researcher Rachel Hutchinson on 
r.hutchinson@my.westminster.ac.uk. You can also contact this address to receive a 
summary of the research findings when the study is complete.   
    
If you know other people who are taking part in this study, please do not mention the 
information given here as it may influence their responses.    
    
Once again, thank you for your time and your participation!

Appendix 3.5: Instructions and examples for second coder 
Photo recall coding 
Participants viewed 9 photos at time A and were asked to describe what they could 
recall about them a month later (time B). Time B data were collected via an online 
questionnaire. 
Each memory of a photo is therefore an individual text which is broken down into 
discrete segments. Segments are not defined by grammatical rules or other restrictions. 
A segment could therefore be a single word: ‘bike’, or phrase: ‘there was a bike.’ It may 
also be a complete sentence, in the case of a thought (see category ‘participants’ 
thoughts’ below). A thought is the only instance where the multiple elements within a 
phrase or sentence are not coded separately: eg: ‘they were just people outside their 
homes making music’ would receive one count (for a thought). 
Discrete segments, once allocated to a code, are not coded again in any other category 
(i.e. no double coding). However, where elements are repeated, they are coded again 
each time. Eg if the participant mentioned a beach twice, this receives two counts. 
However, grammatical referrants (they, he etc) are not coded as further occurrences. 
Justification -  ‘the man’ is closer to an image or representation of the photo content 
than ‘he’ 
‘boy scouts’ – content element (boy) and semantic (scouts). 
It counts as ‘content element’ is it is referenced in the image/description – ‘eg 
Woolworths’ (has the sign visible above the door.) it counts as semantic if it is not 
visible from the image (eg Camden) 
 
The categories are as follows: 
1. Photo content elements: these are details of content within the photos – details 
which could have been retained either through visual observation or through 
listening to an audio guide. Examples: ‘there were trees’, ‘beach’, ‘bridge’, a 
steel drum band’, ‘there was a man.’ However, these are NOT facts or 
conceptual information (see ‘Semantic recall’ category for that).  
2. Photo structure/spatial elements: details that indicate the spatial relationship 
between photo content elements, or details that refer to composition/framing of 
the photo. For example: ‘in the foreground’, ‘in the background’, ‘on their 
right’, ‘behind them’, ‘gathered around him’, ‘the scene was happening in front 
of’. 
3. Event/Activity/Movement: details of events or activities in the photos (in the 
sense of a ‘happening’) eg ‘posing for the picture’, ‘reading’, ‘sunbathing’, 
‘performing music’, ‘they were playing’. Also, movement: ‘they were running’, 
‘children wading’, ‘bending down’, passing by’, ‘walking by’. 

269 
 
 
4. Photo emotion and atmosphere: perceived emotions of photo subjects (NOT 
participants’ emotions) for example: ’ they looked happy’, ‘ their excited 
expressions’, ‘acting spontaneously, ‘he looked quite uncomfortable’. 
Atmosphere of the photo includes weather conditions: ‘’it looked like a warm 
summer’s day’, ‘misty scene’. 
5. Non visual imagery – auditory ‘singing’, ‘cheering him on’, ‘you could almost 
hear the music’. Also tactile or taste imagery. 
6. Participants’ reactions: this category includes participants’ emotional 
reactions, either positive, such as enthusiasm: ‘I liked it, I loved it’ or negative 
such as ‘I remember really not liking this photo.’ This category includes 
cognitive reactions, which are more thought based, such as ‘it was interesting or 
intriguing’ or an aesthetic judgement ‘it was beautiful’.   
7. Participants’ thoughts: thoughts here in the sense of an intellectual evaluation 
– or a reflection. Examples: ‘Unfortunately most of the pictures were singularly 
unmemorable because they were not very good’, ‘this picture represents a way 
of life no longer possible’, ‘They have Paris plage every year and I always think 
it is a shame London doesn't have an equivalent although I think they might 
have had in recent years’, ‘the photos were memorable because of sense of 
pleasure and incongruity.’ Thoughts are not double coded – once the entire 
phrase/sentence is classified as a thought, it is not coded further (eg in the last 
example, pleasure would NOT receive a count for ‘participant reactions’. 
8. Semantic recall – This can include mentions of the photographer, facts or any 
socio-historical information given (this can be vague, even, for example, the 
decade in which the photo was taken. Examples: ‘long standing eel and pie 
shop’, ‘1950s’, ‘some Victorian / Georgian buildings’ (semantic count for 
Victorian/Georgian’, content element count for ‘buildings’). No second coding 
within ‘semantic’ fragments, eg ‘The beach was closed during the war but was 
reopened, finally it was shut for good when concerns were raised about the 
quality of the Thames river water’  - ‘beach’ here not coded for content element 
as it forms part of a broader recall of information rather than an image of 
content. 
9. AB memories – please code any memories that are evoked as the participant 
recalls the photos, and code as either general or specific: eg ‘Visiting Trafalgar 
Square with my own family when I was younger’ (general), ‘I do remember 
years ago going there specially when it had been drained for maintenance.   A 
complete fleet of boats was resting in the mud.’ (specific) 
 
Examples: 
 

270 
 
 
1. Beach (CONTENT ELEMENT) at the fore, (STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL) 
thronging with (EMOTION/ATMOSPHERE) people (CONTENT ELEMENT), 
filling the lower left hand corner of the photo (STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL) 
Tower Bridge (CONTENT ELEMENT) cutting horizontally across the photo 
(STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL) about two thirds up it (STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL) 
We had the perspective of (STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL) a young girl (CONTENT 
ELEMENT) looking (EVENT) in the direction of (STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL) the mid-
point (STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL) of the bridge (CONTENT ELEMENT) 
Some children (CONTENT ELEMENT) paddling (EVENT) in the river (CONTENT 
ELEMENT) 
A nearby (STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL) gent (CONTENT ELEMENT) sad (sat) down 
(STRUCURAL/SPATIAL) on the beach (CONTENT ELEMENT) with his suit 
(CONTENT ELEMENT) on on what seemed to be a very hot day 
(EMOTION/ATMOSPHERE) 
The beach was created before the 2nd World Ward, (SEMANTIC) and was closed 
during the war (SEMANTIC).  It re-opened again (SEMANTIC), but was permanently 
closed in the 70s (SEMANTIC) after water quality problems were confirmed 
(SEMANTIC) 
 
2. Tower Bridge (CONTENT ELEMENT) Beach (CONTENT ELEMENT) 
People (CONTENT ELEMENT) enjoying themselves (EMOTION/ATMOSPHERE) by 
the river (CONTENT ELEMENT). Tranquillity in the middle of the city. (THOUGHT) 
 
3. Eel pie stall (CONTENT ELEMENT) 
Discovering (PARTICIPANT REACTION) there was such a thing as eel pies 
(SEMANTIC) and the bustle (MOVEMENT) of the street market (CONTENT 
ELEMENT) 
 
4. Boys (CONTENT ELEMENT) sitting in (STRUCUTRAL/SPATIAL) a field 
(CONTENT ELEMENT) having lunch (EVENT) 
I can visualise the image of boys (CONTENT ELEMENT), I think boy scouts 
(SEMANTIC), having a packed lunch (EVENT) in a field/park (CONTENT 
ELEMENT). There was one girl (CONTENT ELEMENT) to the left of the photo 
(STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL). There was a monument (CONTENT ELEMENT) in the 
background (STRUCTURAL/SPATIAL). I remember not really liking the photo 
(PARTICIPANT REACTION) but it has come back to me quite vividly (THOUGHT).

Appendix 4: Chapter 5 
Appendix 4.1: Additional Henry Grant photo and AD text: 
 
 
Henry Grant took this photo in 1978. It’s called ‘Buying a wig, Camden Market.’ 
We stand with Grant at an L-shaped market stall, mingling with the shoppers. The stall 
is in the foreground  - it’s a bric-a-brac stall, laden with a collection of unwanted 
household items, such as cushions and a lampshade. 
 The clear focal point of the photo is a woman in her forties, slightly to the right of 
centre. She examines a collection of wigs. She has a long fringe that reaches her eyes – 
it’s flattened down by a headscarf tied tightly under her chin. She wears a thick, bulky 
coat, down to her knees where the frame finishes. By her left elbow is the handle of her 
shopping trolley, with her umbrella dangling from it. The strap of a black bag strains 
across her chest and pulls at the thick material of her coat under her right arm and at her 
left shoulder. The bag looks full and heavy and is pushed uncomfortably behind her 
back to allow her hands to explore items on the stall.  With her eyes down, her attention 
is entirely focused on the light-coloured wig that she holds in her right hand. In her left 
she holds two - a wig of silky dark hair and a second lighter one. Her right arm, with the 
lighter wig, is extended and she holds it higher than her left, as if giving this one at least 
momentary preference. Despite the thick coat, she wears no gloves. Perhaps she has 
removed them to better feel and assess the thick, wiry texture of the locks of hair which 
fill her hands. 
The stall where we stand is on a street corner with the road immediately beyond it. To 
the right of the woman, about one quarter of the photo, the scene opens out with a view 

272 
 
 
down an adjacent street, with terraced houses and parked cars. This is the only section 
of the photo where the sky is visible, and it is a bright day. 
To the left of the woman, a building on the street corner fills the frame for the remaining 
three quarters of the photograph. The building itself is mostly obscured. A billboard 
advertising Bingo covers much of it, promising ‘Free Membership’ and ‘Eyes down’ at 
2.55. Below the billboard, a refuse lorry is at the street corner on the far side of the road 
from the stall. The smell of its contents will reach the shoppers due to its open side. 
It is clearly the woman in the centre of the photo who has caught Grant’s attention, but 
she is not alone at the stall. Two women, to the left of her, are also examining its 
contents. One stands at the far left hand side of the shot and is only partially captured. 
Similarly, another visitor to the stall just edges into the frame on the extreme right. 
Tourism, gentrification and youth culture have all converged to change the face of 
Camden’s market scene. Today, a walk between Camden Tube and Camden Lock takes 
the visitor through an eclectic series of markets offering international street food and 
original fashion and design. This photo may have been taken at the more traditional 
market at nearby Inverness Street, near Camden Tube. Grant did much of his street 
photography in between assignments, taking pictures constantly, searching the city for 
stories and images that few others would consider worthwhile. He photographed 
everyday market scenes across London, often holding the camera at waist height to pass 
unnoticed. He may have been drawn to this scene due to the unusual element of the 
wigs. The image allows us an unobtrusive view into everyday market life in the 1970s.

Appendix 4.3: Time B questionnaire 
Sample Time B Questionnaire hosted on Qualtrics for sighted participants and BPS 
screen-reader users (with branching to different versions). As before, the questionnaire 
was also provided in a screen-reader friendly and large-print MS Word version for BPS 
participants. 
Museum Audio Description: Follow Up Questionnaire       
Thank you again for participating in this research study. Now that it is approximately 
one month since you listened to the Henry Grant Audio Guide, we'd like to ask you a 
few questions about the exhibition that we presented to you. This should take about 20 
minutes to complete. 
The questionnaire asks you to recall some details about the photos, and to share your 
opinions about them, and the audio guide you listened to. Some of the questions will be 
the same as before, and some will be different. Please do not worry about how you 
responded last time, we want your thoughts today.  Some of your ratings/thoughts may 
be the same as before, some may be different. That is completely fine. Please do not 
worry if you can't remember the photos in detail. Even fragments of information, no 
matter how hazy they may seem to you, will be very valuable for the study. 
Please enter your name here (everything you write here today will be subsequently 
anonymised and your personal data treated confidentially, this is just for us to match 
your responses to the questionnaire you completed previously) 
Firstly, we are interested to know how much you enjoyed the experience. To what 
extent did you enjoy the Henry Grant exhibition? Please select from one of the 
following options below: 
 loved it  
 liked it a lot  
 liked it  
 it was ok  
 didn't like it  
 really didn't like it  
 hated it  
 

291 
 
 
and how likely is it that you would want to experience more of the Museum of London's 
photography collections? 
 definitely  
 probably  
 maybe or don't know  
 probably not  
 definitely not  
 
In this section, we would like you to tell us what you remember about the Henry Grant 
photos. It does not need to be the order in which you viewed them. Any order is fine.   
    
For each photo that you remember, please tell us the title, or give a few words of your 
own to identify it. Then we would please like you to tell us any details that come into 
your mind as you think about it. This could be a person, building or other detail that you 
remember from the photo, or it could be a particular piece of information, word or 
phrase that comes to mind as you remember the photo.    
    
It might be clear to you, slightly hazy, or just a fragment of information, but that doesn't 
matter. Please list all the details that you can remember below.  We would really 
appreciate it if you could give as much information as you can.   
    
Don't worry if you can't remember all the photos. Please just fill in as much information 
as you can for those you do remember. We have provided space for you to give us 
details about all 8 photos, but you can skip through the rest of these pages if you have 
filled in all you can.

Thank you for participating in this study. This section provides some further 
information and explanation about the study. Once you reach the end of the information 
below, please ensure that you click on the final next arrow at the bottom of this page, in 
order to record your response. 
 
This study is exploring different ways of presenting information to museum visitors. In 
particular, we are keen to understand how audio description can be enhanced with sound 
and how this might impact on the experience for the visitor.   
    
This study presented photos using Audio Description, which is used to present artworks 
to blind and partially sighted museum visitors. We presented each participant with 8 
descriptions, half of which were plain and half of which had additional sounds.    
    
We are keen to understand which kind of presentation is most enjoyed by museum 
visitors, and whether this affects how people might connect to the artwork and what 
they might remember.   
    
If you would like any further information about the different kinds of presentations used 
here, please contact the researcher Rachel Hutchinson on
