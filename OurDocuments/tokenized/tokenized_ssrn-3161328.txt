neutrality

principles
for
platform
regulation
introduction
the
question
whether
online
platforms
need
to
be
regulated
has
been
heavily
debated
by
legal
scholars
without
clear
answer
however
it
appears
that
policymakers
in
different
eu
member
states
and
at
eu
level
have
drawn
their
conclusions
and
are
proposing
or
adopting
regulation
regulation
is
used
in
broad
sense
here
referring
to
specific
legal
instruments
as
well
as
the
application
of
competition
law
but
this
article
focuses
on
the
former
most
notably
france
has
adopted
law
on
platform
fairness
while
the
european
commission
commission
not
only
ordered
google
to
implement
form
of
search
neutrality
but
is
also
tabling
regulatory
proposals
on
fairness
in
platform-supplier
relations
there
is
however
disconnect
between
the
academic
debate
and
the
political
reality
the
first
issue
is
that
legal
scholars
often
discuss
the
in
appropriateness
of
platform-specific
regulation
without
clear
view
of
what
this
regulation
looks
like
which
means
that
both
support
and
criticism
miss
clear
target
as
the
scholarly
discussion
is
not
centred
on
the
regulation
that
is
actually
being
proposed
policymakers
cannot
fully
benefit
from
the
academic
debate
this
brings
us
to
the
second
issue
namely
that
policymakers
make
scholarly
discussion
difficult
by
presenting
their
regulatory
proposals
in
terms
of
fairness
and
neutrality
goals
that
are
lofty
but
meaningless
in
and
of
themselves
to
solve
the
two-way
disconnect
between
academia
and
policy
this
article
seeks
to
propose
frame
of
reference
for
productive
debate
on
platform
regulation
it
does
so
by
extracting
from
the
various
regulatory
initiatives
two
operational
principles
namely
transparency
and
non-discrimination
to
achieve
its
goal
of
presenting
meaningful
principles
for
platform
regulation
the
article
is
structured
in
three
parts
each
with
its
proper
methodology
it
starts
with
brief
doctrinal
review
of
the
legal
debate
on
the
need
for
platform
regulation
section
while
platforms
give
rise
to
several
concerns
the
article
identifies
the
economic
dynamic
that
is
at
the
heart
of
many
of
the
regulatory
initiatives
section
the
main
resource
for
this
exercise
is
the
economic
literature
on
online
platforms
which
is
primarily
theoretical
but
incipiently
empirical
the
main
part
of
the
article
then
surveys
the
policy
initiatives
targeting
online
platforms
both
at
the
eu
level
and
at
the
member
state
level
with
focus
on
france
section
as
there
is
lack
of
primary
research
on
this
topic
an
objective
preliminary
description
of
the
proposed
legal
instruments
is
crucial
through
critical
analysis
the
article
then
distils
from
these
instruments
operational
principles
for
platform
regulation
and
identifies
in
which
cases
they
can
serve
purpose
the
need
for
online
platform
regulation
many
authors
have
discussed
the
need
for
regulation
of
online
platforms
such
as
google
amazon
facebook
and
apple
their
views
can
be
split
up
in
two
camps
which
may
be
termed
with
some
simplification
anti
intervention
on
the
one
hand
and
pro
intervention
on
the
other
in
the
anti-intervention
camp
are
authors
who
argue
that
intervention
in
digital
markets
should
be
kept
to
minimum
the
reasons
they
offer
vary
some
argue
that
competitive
issues
are
unlikely
to
develop
in
digital
markets

and
that
when
they
do

the
preliminary
question
is
how

however

on
such
definition
is
elusive
generally
they
can
be
described
as

this

amounts
to
30
of
the

of

and
subsequent

in

situation
the
platform
may
seek
to
capture

chain
first
straightforward
way
to
do
so
is
by
increasing
the

it
demands
from

there
is
also
more
intricate
and
possibly
more
profitable
way
to
capture
more
value
namely
by
integrating
vertically
vertical
integration
means
that
the
platform
starts
creating
its
own
goods
or
services
for
distribution
through
its
platform
in
order
to
make
an
additional
profit
on
those
sales
after
such
vertical
integration
the
platform
actually
competes
with
certain
suppliers
which
creates
an
incentive
to
exclude
them
this
exclusion
can
be
carried
out
explicitly
through
the
delisting
of
certain
suppliers

this
exclusion

cases

regulatory

in

should
be

however
given
the
novelty
of
this

and
the
duration
of

competition
law
has
not
been
sufficiently
applied
to
potentially
abusive
behaviour
in
the
digital
economy
and
it
thus
remains
unclear
whether
this
branch
of
law
can
adequately
regulate

platforms
nevertheless
some
authorities
in
europe
have
at
least
implicitly
concluded
that
competition
law
is
not
up
to
the
task
consequently
they
are
preparing
or
have
already
adopted
specific
regulation

the
relationship
between
platforms
and

4.1
introduction
the
possibilities
for
platform
regulation
are
situated
on
broad
spectrum
limited
by
two
extremes
on
one
side
of
this
spectrum
we
find
the
complete
freedom
from
regulatory
intervention
for
platform
operators
while
such
freedom
is
difficult
to
imagine
since
platforms
are
subject
to
various
parts
of
the
current
legal
framework
eleven
eu
member
states
did
call
on
the
commission
not
to
specifically
regulate
platforms
joint

situated
on
the
other
side
of
the
spectrum
are
complete
bans
on
certain
platform
behaviour
we
are
now
seeing
an
example
of
the
latter
in
the
bans
on
so-called
most
favoured
nation
clauses
between
booking
platforms
and
hotels
these
clauses
prohibit
the
hotel
from
offering
their
rooms
at
lower
price
or
under
better
conditions
on
their
own
website
and
or
on
other
platforms
after

authorities
took

approach

the
permissibility
of
these
clauses

exploring
most
of

regulatory

two
principles

neutrality

fairness

these

much
in
and

themselves

matters
this

the

them

claim
to
represent

the

principle
that
surfaces

lies
under

surface
of

consideration
the
new
regulation
is
motivated
in
part
by
worries
concerning
vertical
integration
the
idea
being
that
isps
could
give
their
downstream
services
preferential
treatment
over
those
of
competing
content
providers
they
could
for
example
slow
down
youtube
and
netflix
to
make
their
video
service
more
attractive
make
spotify
traffic
shaky
to
draw
users
to
its
own
music
streaming
service
or
mess
with
the
speed
of
online
communication
services
to
make
their
own
apps
more
popular
such
conduct
is
prohibited
by
article
of
the
regulation
which
states
providers
of
internet
access
services
shall
treat
all
traffic
equally
when

on

there
are
two
important
parallels
between
these

policies
firstly
they
seek
to
prevent
networks
from
excluding

that

downstream
telecom
entrants
in
the

of

and

in

secondly
they
are
implicitly
premised
on
the
idea
that
these
networks
are
essential
enough
to
be
qualified
as
utilities
in
the
us
for
example
net

was
imposed
by
classifying

as

given
the
importance
of

for

of

and
the
fact
that

leads
them
to

may

whether
they
should
be

not

also
broader

such
as

and
freedom

the
most
convincing
distinction
is
that

after

of

the

issued
its

in

in

it
decided
that

the

describes
how
as
intermediaries
platforms
do
not
only
connect
their
users
but
may
also
become
their
competitors
they
note
how
this
intermediary
position
gives
platforms
big
competitive
advantage
over
their
suppliers
which
may
lead
to
discriminatory
and
non-transparent
conditions
of
access
to
the
platform
accordingly
it
is
crucial
that
ranked
results
are
fully
transparent
so
that
users
can
easily
distinguish
between

for

results
favoured

these

that
is
not
justified
by

another
idea
consists
in
the
principle
of
equal

for

who
have
become
competitors
of
indispensable
platforms
which
would
particularly
apply
to
rankings
and
to
conditions
of

the
report
was
ordered
by
and
submitted
to
the
french
government
and
some
of
its
considerations
made
it

the
french
law

is
discussed

authorities
most
notably

is

the

drafted

on

on

in
the

it
observes
that

no

the

technical
and
passive
role
that
is
required
to
benefit
from
the

regime
contained
in

the

thus
considers
it

to

legal
category
for
platforms
that
offer
ranking
or
listing
services
for
content
goods
or
services
placed
online
by
third
parties
it
argues
that
these
platforms
cannot
be
subjected
to
principle
of
neutrality
or
equal
treatment
because
it
is
their
role
to
hierarchise
results
on
the

thereby
favouring
some
over
others
according
to
the
french

these

it
starts
out
by
describing
structural
imbalance
between
the
platform
and
its
suppliers
due
to
the
intermediary
position
of
the
platform
which
may
when
vertically
integrated
also
compete
with

after
observing
that
existing
law
remains
difficult
to
apply
to

conduct
the
council
proposes
to
adopt
general
principle
of
fairness
this
principle
seeks
to
oblige
the
platform
to
carry
out
its
services
in
good
faith
without
distorting
them
for
purposes
contrary
to
the
interests

ecosystem
would
have
to

with
view
to
normalising
access
to
inescapable
platforms
the
council
adds
two
more
recommendations
to
install
an
obligation
for
the
platform
to
inform
its
suppliers
in
advance
in
case
of
major
changes
relating
to
tariffs
content
or
algorithms
and
ii
to
apply

in

except
in

of
legitimate
considerations
that
are
compatible
with
the
interests
of

users
the
scope
of
application
of

would
not
be
determined
by
definition
but
by
number
of
criteria
including
the

it
starts
by
describing
the
competitive
dynamics
of
online
platforms
and
how
some
of
them
have
grown
into
quasi-inescapable
intermediaries
the
report
particularly
notes
how
these
platforms
are
able
to
impose
significantly
imbalanced
conditions
on
their
suppliers
and
how
after
vertical
integration
they
are
able
to
restrict
competition
by
favouring
their
offer
over
their
suppliers
moreover
it
is
not
always
easy
for
users
to
determine
when
this
happens
in
the
first
place
the

finds
it
necessary
to
better
adapt
competition
law
to

platforms
it
also
believes
there
is
room
for
specific
regulatory
instrument
beyond
competition
law
but
takes
note
of
several
issues
firstly
there
are
the
definitional
problems
in
that
regard
the
report
finds
the
platform
definition
in
the
council
of
state
2014
report
flawed
because
it
is
both
too
broad
as
it
targets
all
platforms
not
only
those
in
dominant
position
and
too
narrow
as
it
captures
only
platforms
whose
content
is
determined
by
third
parties
not
those
with
greater
editorial
role
such
as
netflix
or

it
also
takes
issue
with
the
digital
council
focus
on
platforms
with
the
greatest
capacity
for
hindrance
as
this
is
more
of
moral
than
legal
notion
the
report
prefers
the
notion
of
digital
platforms
that
are
structuring
for
the
economy
finally
the
report
goes
into
objectives
of
the
regulation
and
the
different
ways
to
conceive
the
obligations
it
examines
different
ideas
most
of
which
are
centred
on
transparency
and
non-discrimination
however
it
does
not

final
key
issue
is
the
lack

all
of

conclude

principles
we
can
dis
agree
on
the
proposals
for
platform
regulation
discussed
above
brand
themselves
around
neutrality
and
fairness
while
such
terms
sound
lofty
and
as
we
have
already
stated
they
do
not
carry
much
meaning
in
and
of
themselves
in
the
preceding
section
we
therefore
took
closer
look
at
how
exactly
regulatory
authorities
conceive
these
principles
this
subsection
distils
from
these
various
conceptions
more
substantive
principles
which
can
then
form
the
basis
of
meaningful
discussion
on
their
merit
most
of
the
initiatives
are
concerned
with
the
search
function
of
platforms
having
google
as
their
explicit
or
implicit
main
target
generally
the
scope
of
application
of
these
new
regulations
is
defined
as
online
services
that
list
or
rank
the
content
goods
or
services
of
third
parties
which
would
also
capture
marketplaces
such
as
amazon
such
functional
definition
circumvents
the
disagreement
on
conceptual
platform
definition
but
focusing
solely
on
the
listing
ranking
function
means
that
not
only
intermediaries
but
also
undertakings
that
operate
more
traditional
distribution
model
netflix
and
spotify
are
included
another
question
is
whether
regulation
should
target
every
online
platform
or
only
those
platforms
in
dominant
position
or
with
significant
effect
on
the
economy
otherwise
defined
dominance
assessments
especially
in
dynamic
two-sided
markets
may
be
difficult
but
general
application
of

such
as
the

are
also
conceivable
almost
all
proposals
for

are
centred
around

however
the
fact
that
proposals
under
different

overlap
while
proposals
under

heading
differ
shows
how
these
terms
are
impossible
to
evaluate
as
such
this
article
proposes
to
shift
the
debate
towards
two
clearer
principles
namely
transparency
and
nondiscrimination
both
of
these
principles
serve
to
establish
more
level
playing
field
between
platforms
and
their
suppliers
but
while
transparency
only
tempers
the
benefit
platform
can
derive
from
favouring
its
own
services
over
those
of
certain
suppliers
non-discrimination
limits
or
even
eliminates
this
possibility
transparency
the
primary
transparency
obligation
is
making
clear
distinction
between
search
results
that
are
generated
organically
by
the
search
algorithm
the
results
that
are
paid
for
by
advertisers
and
the
results
that
are
favoured
because
of
their
connection
to
the
platform
this
transparency
must
be
ensured
towards
consumers
however
when
consumers
distrust
advertised
and
favoured
results
it
also
has
an
effect
on
competition
between
suppliers
and
between
the
platform
and
suppliers
second
kind
of
transparency
is
geared
directly
towards
suppliers
suppliers
should
in
the
first
place
receive
information
on
the
platform
ranking
algorithm
transparency
would
also
comprise
the
timely
communication
by
the
platform
of
significant
changes
in
its
ranking
policy
or
terms
and
conditions
rather
than
general
announcements
this
information
obligation
would
have
to
be
carried
out
specifically
towards
the
supplier
that
is
impacted
by
the
change
demotion
or
delisting
such
transparency
may
for
example
give
developers
the
opportunity
to
adapt
their
apps
to
the
changing
terms
and
conditions
governing
the
platform
application
programming
interface
api
rather
than
being
removed
from
the
platform
for
non-compliance
with
unnotified
changes
if
it
does
come
to
delisting
the
platform
should
provide
reasons
transparency
on
the
internet
enjoys
broad
support
as
illustrated
by
its
inclusion
in
the
oecd
principles
for
internet
policy
making
2011
the
european
council
has
joined
the
european
commission
and
parliament
in
stressing
the
necessity
of
increased
transparency
in
platforms
practices
and
uses
2017
however
many
authorities
consider
that
transparency
alone
will
not
solve
the
perceived
competitive
issues
and
believe
that
nondiscrimination
is
called
for
this
is
also
what
happened
in
the
course
of
the
google
search
investigation
google
offered
to
maintain
high
degree
of
transparency
and
more
european
commission
2013
but
the
commission
did
not
accept
these
commitments
and
finally
ordered
google
to
comply
with
the
principle
of
equal
treatment
non-discrimination
non-discrimination
or
its
positive
equivalent
equal
treatment
goes
step
further
than
transparency
it
generally
implies
that
an
online
platform
cannot
discriminate
in
favour
of
its
own
offering
in
the
first
place
this
means
that
the
platform
cannot
skew
the
search
results
in
favour
of
its
own
services
however
algorithms
are
meant
to
favour
certain
results
and
demote
others
to
present
useful
ranking
mindful
of
this
inherent
function
of
algorithms
authorities
have
sought
to
specify
the
obligation
of
non-discrimination
the
common
formula
then
goes
that
platforms
cannot
alter
or
distort
the
ranking
for
purposes
contrary
to
the
interests
of
its
users
however

high
commission

of

in

regulatory

to
right

especially
after
the

equal

easily

for
example
when
the

the
app
store
must
allow
other

which

to

obliging
platforms
to
charge
equal
commission
rates
on
its
own
downstream
services
and
on
those
of
competing
suppliers
is
bad
idea
either
the
commission
rate
on
competing
products
is
scrapped
and
the
platform
business
model
collapses
for
lack
of
profits
or
the
platform
charges
its
downstream
services
an
equal
rate
which
would
have
no
effect
because
this
constitutes
an
internal
transfer
an
idea
would
be
to
determine
fair
reasonable
and
non-discriminatory
terms
for
access
to
the
platform
but
regulators
would
then
have
to
engage
in
the
difficult
exercise
of
price
regulation
moreover
such
an
obligation
would
be
premised
on
the
debatable
idea
that
certain
online
platforms
are
essential
to
suppliers
better
idea
to
prevent
commission
rates
from
distorting
competition
on
online
platforms
is
applying
the
margin
squeeze
test
bostoen

translating
this
test
to
the
platform
economy
would
mean
asking
the
following
question
could
the
vertically
integrated
platform
offer
its
downstream
product
to
end-users
profitably
if
it
had
to
pay
its
own
commission
rate
applied
to
the
example
above
the
question
would
be
is
apple
music
subscription
model
profitable
after
discounting
the
30
cut
imposed
on
competitors
if
not
the
platform
would
have
to
adapt
either
its
commission
rate
or
the
price
of
its
downstream
product
note
that
applying
this
framework
does
not
even
require
adopting
new
non-discrimination
rule
as
margin
squeeze
is
already
part
of
current
competition
law
conclusion
the
relationship
between
online
platforms
and
suppliers
is
difficult
one
firstly
suppliers
are
often
dependent
on
the
platform
they
use
to
offer
their
products
to
consumers
additionally
platforms
increasingly
integrate
vertically
which
means
they
start
competing
with
their
suppliers
on
the
downstream
market
this
gives
them
an
incentive
to
exclude
competing
suppliers
an
incentive
that
is
not
infrequently
acted
upon
incipient
empirical
research
shows
that
these
practices
do
not
only
harm
competitors
but
can
also
harm
consumers
in
that
case
platform-supplier
competition
must
be
regulated
this
article
sought
to
bring
clarity
to
the
debate

the
