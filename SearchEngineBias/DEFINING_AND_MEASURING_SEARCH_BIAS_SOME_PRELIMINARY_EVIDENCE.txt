Defining and Measuring Search Bias:
Some Preliminary Evidence

Joshua D. Wright*

INTRODUCTION
Search engines produce immense value by identifying, organizing, and
presenting the Internet´s information in response to users´ queries.1 Search engines
efficiently provide better and faster answers to users´ questions than alternatives.
Recently, critics have taken issue with the various methods search engines use to
identify relevant content and rank search results for users. Google, in particular, has
been the subject of much of this criticism on the grounds that its organic search
results—those generated algorithmically—favor its own products and services at the
expense of those of its rivals.

It is widely understood that search engines´ algorithms for ranking various web
pages naturally differ.

Likewise, there is widespread recognition that competition

among search engines is vigorous, and that differentiation between engines´ ranking
functions is not only desirable, but a natural byproduct of competition, necessary to
survival, and beneficial to consumers.2 Nonetheless, despite widespread recognition of
the consumer benefits of such differentiation, complaints from rival search engines have
persisted and succeeded in attracting attention from a number of state, federal and
international regulatory agencies. Unfortunately, much of this attention has focused on
the impact upon individual websites of differences among search engines´ algorithmic
methods of identifying and ranking relevant content, rather than analyzing these
differences from a conventional consumer‐welfare driven antitrust analysis.

For

example, many of these complaints ignore the fact that search engine users self‐select
into different engines or use multiple engines for different types of searches when
considering the competitive implications of search rankings.3

Rather than focus upon competition among search engines in how results are
identified and presented to users, critics and complainants craft their arguments around
alleged search engine “discrimination” or “bias.”4 The complainants must have in mind
something other than competitive decisions to rank content that differ from the
decisions made by rivals; bias in this sense is both necessary to and inherent within any
useful indexing tool. Yet, critics have generally avoided a precise definition of the
allegedly troublesome conduct. Indeed, the term “bias” is used colloquially and is
frequently invoked in the search engine debate to encompass a wide array of
behavior—generally suggesting a latent malignancy within search engine conduct—
with some critics citing mere differences in results across engines as evidence of
harmful conduct.5
The more useful attempts to define “bias,” however, focus upon differences in
organic rankings attributable to the search engine ranking its own content (“own‐
content bias”); that is, a sufficient condition for own‐content bias is that a search engine
ranks its own content more prominently than its rivals do. To be even more precise
about the nature of the alleged “own‐content bias,” it should be clear that this form of

We will use the term “bias” throughout without loss of generality to refer to algorithmic differences
among search engines that result in relatively favorable ranking for an engine´s own content.

bias refers exclusively to organic results, i.e., those results the search engine produces
algorithmically, as distinguished from the paid advertisements that might appear at the
top, bottom, or right‐hand side of a search result page.6 Critics at the Senate’s recent
hearing on the “Power of Google” were particularly vociferous on this front, accusing
Google of having “cooked”7 its algorithm and of “rig[ging] its results, biasing in favor
of Google.”8
Competition economists and regulatory agencies are familiar with business
arrangements which give rise to concerns of own‐content bias.9

Complaints and

economic theories of harm assert that a vertically integrated firm (in this case, Google
offers search results as well as products like YouTube and Google Maps) might
discriminate against its rivals by “foreclosing” them from access to a critical input.

OneBox results are also not necessarily part of organic search, but involve rich text, including data for
which Google has paid. “OneBox results are when Google shows information within a special unit, often
with images associated with them. OneBox unit often appears to highlight news, shopping, image and
other results that are blended into regular listings using Universal Search.” Danny Sullivan, Meet the

Here, the critical input necessary for rivals´ success is alleged to be prominent
placement in Google´s search results. The economics of the potential anticompetitive
exclusion of rivals involving vertically integrated firms are well understood in antitrust.
The conditions that must be satisfied for these concerns to generate real risk to
consumers are also well known. Over a century of antitrust jurisprudence, economic
study, and enforcement agency practice have produced a well‐understood economic
analysis of the competitive effects of a vertically integrated firm´s “discrimination” in
favor of its own products or services, including widespread recognition that such
arrangements generally produce significant benefits for consumers.

Modern

competition policy recognizes that vertical integration and contractual arrangements
are generally procompetitive; it also understands that discrimination of this sort may
create the potential for competitive harm under some conditions. Sensible competition
policy involving vertical integration and contractual arrangements requires one to be
sensitive to the potential consumer welfare‐enhancing potential of such vertical
integration while also taking seriously the possibility that a firm might successfully
harm competition itself (and not merely a rival).
In addition to the failure to distinguish procompetitive conduct from
anticompetitive behavior, critics´ allegations of own‐content bias suffer deeper
conceptual ambiguities.

The perceived issue for Google´s rivals is not merely that

Google links to a map when responding to search queries, suggesting one might be

5

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

relevant for the user; indeed, rival search engines frequently respond to similar user
queries with their own or other map products. Rather, critics find problematic that
Google responds to user queries with a Google Map. This is a critical distinction because
it concedes that rivals´ complaints are not satisfied by the response that consumers are
better off with the map; nor do critics pause to consider that perhaps the Google search
user prefers the Google Map to rival products.10 Thus, critics brazenly take issue with
the relationship between Google and the search result even where they concede Google
produces more relevant results for consumers.11 Rather than focusing upon consumers,
critics argue that the fact that Google is affiliated with the referred search result is itself
prima facie evidence of competitively harmful bias.12 On its face, this argument turns
conventional antitrust wisdom on its head. Conduct that harms rivals merely because it
attracts consumers from rivals is the essence of competition and the logical core of the
maxim that antitrust protects “competition, not competitors.ʺ13
Critics´ failure to account for the potential consumer benefits from ʺown‐content
biasʺ extends beyond ignoring the fact that users might prefer Google´s products to
Sullivan, supra note 2 (“If someone´s searching for “maps” on Google, they may be more likely to want
Google Maps than Yahoo Maps – and vice versa.”).

rivals´.

Most critics simply ignore the myriad of procompetitive explanations for

vertical integration in the economics literature. This omission by critics, and especially
by economist critics, is mystifying given that economists have documented not only a
plethora of procompetitive justifications for such integration, but also that such vertical
relationships are much more likely to be competitively beneficial or benign than to raise
serious threats of foreclosure.14
The critical antitrust question is always whether the underlying conduct creates
or maintains monopoly power and thus reduces competition and consumer welfare, or
is more likely efficient and procompetitive.

To be clear, documenting the mere

existence of own‐content bias itself does little to answer this question. Bias is not a
sufficient condition for competitive harm as a matter of economics because it can
increase, decrease, or have no impact at all upon consumer welfare; neither is bias,
without more, sufficient to state a cognizable antitrust claim.15
Nonetheless, documenting whether and how much of the alleged bias exists in
Google´s and its rivals´ search results can improve our understanding of its competitive
implications—that is, whether the evidence of discrimination in favor of one´s own
content across search engines is more consistent with anticompetitive foreclosure or
with competitive differentiation.

Critically, in order to generate plausible competitive concerns, search bias must,
at minimum, be sufficient in magnitude to foreclose rivals from achieving minimum
efficient scale (otherwise, if it merely represents effective competition that makes life
harder for competitors, it is not an antitrust concern at all). It follows from this
necessary condition that not all evidence of ʺbiasʺ is relevant to this competitive
concern; in particular, Google referring to its own products and services more
prominently than its rivals rank those same services has little to do with critics´
complaints unless they implicate general or vertical search.
Despite widespread discussion of search engine bias, virtually no evidence exists
indicating that bias abounds—and very little that it exists at all. Edelman & Lockwood
recently addressed this dearth of evidence by conducting a small study focused upon
own‐content bias in 32 search queries. They contend that their results are indicative of
systemic and significant bias demanding antitrust intervention.16 The authors define
and measure ʺbiasʺ as the extent to which a search engine´s ranking of its own content
differs from how its rivals rank the same content. This approach provides some useful
information concerning differences among search engine rankings. However, the study
should not be relied upon to support broad sweeping antitrust policy concerns with
Google.

The small sample of search queries provides one reason for caution. Perhaps
more importantly, the non‐random sample of search queries undermines its utility for
addressing the critical antitrust policy questions focusing upon the magnitude of search
bias, both generally and as it relates to whether the degree and nature of observed bias
satisfies the well‐known conditions required for competitive foreclosure.

Further,

evaluating their evidence at face value, Edelman & Lockwood misinterpret its relevance
(Edelman & Lockwood in fact find almost no evidence of bias) and, most
problematically, simply assume that own‐content bias is inherently suspect from a
consumer welfare perspective rather than considering the well‐known consumer
benefits of vertical integration. Despite these shortcomings, Edelman & Lockwood´s
study has received considerable attention, both in the press and from Google´s critics,
who cite it as evidence of harmful and anticompetitive search engine behavior.17
In the present analysis, as a starting point, we first “replicate” and analyze
Edelman & Lockwood´s earlier study of a small, non‐random sample of search queries
in the modern search market. We then extend this methodology to a larger random
sample of search queries in order to draw more reliable inferences concerning the
answers to crucial questions for the competition policy debate surrounding search
engine bias, including: (1) what precisely is search engine bias?; (2) what are its

relative frequency across search engines?; and, most importantly, (5) does observed
search engine bias pose a competitive threat or is it a feature of competition between
search engines?

claims of “own‐content bias” and delineates its utility and shortcomings as a theory of
antitrust harm; it further evaluates Edelman & Lockwood’s study, methodology and
analysis using this framework. Part II lays out the methodology employed in our own
studies. Part III presents the results of our replication of Edelman & Lockwood and
analyzes antitrust implications for the search engine bias debate; Part IV does the same
for our larger, random sample of search queries. Part V concludes.

Defining and Measuring Search Engine “Bias”
A. Defining Search “Bias”
Google critics and search neutrality proponents employ the term “bias” to

describe the general conceptual idea of differentiation of organic search results based
upon criteria other than “the merits.” For example, some define the relevant bias as any
conduct that “involve[s] the manipulation or shaping of search engine results.”18 Adam
Raff of Foundem goes so far as to claim that any deviation from results that are

comprehensive, impartial and relevant constitutes bias.19 The antitrust policy focus
upon search results, however, has a narrower scope: a search engine´s treatment of its
own content.

“Own content” includes links to a search engine’s affiliated sites

(YouTube, e.g.), “OneBox” results (immediate answers to queries provided at the top of
search results), and “universal” or “blended” results (including not only traditional
links, but news, images, maps, etc.)). In other words (and perhaps tellingly), “own
content” refers to search results in the form of information created or owned by a search
engine other than the traditional outbound, “ten blue links.” Google´s general and
vertical search competitors often claim that Google purposefully refers to its own
content more prominently than that of its rivals.20
As discussed, the implicit antitrust claim is that Google´s discrimination against
its rivals results in foreclosure from access to web users, and ultimately in harm to

competition. Each of these complaints, however, relies upon a definition of bias that
misconstrues the very nature of search engine results and thus the role of competition
among search engines in providing those results to consumers.

The complaints

presume the existence of some intrinsically correct and true list and sequence of results
exists and is readily identifiable; however, “bias” is not only inherent in, but also
necessary to, any workable indexing system of any size.21

Search engines create

immense value by serving a set of customers with remarkably heterogeneous
preferences.22 Indeed, search engines face downward sloping demand for their services
because they are differentiated from one another upon many dimensions. Not only is
this differentiation innocuous as a competitive matter, but competition among search
engines to satisfy diverse consumer preferences drives this outcome and encourages
innovation.

Accordingly, a naked identification of bias is simply meaningless for

antitrust purposes because it says nothing about its impact upon consumers. Further

billion of this contributes directly to GDP). See also Chen at al., supra note 1; Varian, supra note 1.
Accordingly, the quest to define search bias and to enforce the elusive and mythical search “neutrality”
has thus far proven to be more of a distraction than a useful construct. See, e.g., Manne & Wright, supra

analysis, at minimum including a determination of its magnitude and whether it in fact
implicates anticompetitive foreclosure, is required.
B. Edelman & Lockwood´s Study of Search Engine Bias23
Edelman & Lockwood “investigate . . . [w]hether search engines´ algorithmic
results favor their own services, and if so, which search engines do most, to what extent,
and in what substantive areas.”24 Their approach is to measure the difference in how
frequently search engines refer to their own content relative to how often their rivals do
so. While this approach provides useful descriptive facts about differences among
search engines with respect to links to their own content, as discussed, it does little to
inform antitrust analysis because the authors begin with the rather odd assertion that
competition among differentiated search engines for consumers is a puzzle that creates
an air of suspicion around the practice: ʺit is hard to see why results would vary . . .
across search engines.”25

This assertion completely discounts both the vigorous

competitive product differentiation that occurs in nearly all modern product markets as
well as the obvious selection effects at work in own content bias (Google users likely
prefer Google content). This combination detaches Edelman & Lockwood´s analysis
from the consumer welfare perspective, and thus antitrust policy relevance, despite

Edelman & Lockwood, supra note 16.
Id.
25 Id. Others have remarked upon the absurdity of this assertion. Danny Sullivan, for example, states
“It´s not hard to see why search engine result differ at all. Search engines each use their own “algorithm”
to cull through the pages they´ve collected from across the web, to decide which pages to rank first . . . .
Google has a different algorithm than Bing. In short, Google will have a different opinion than Bing.
Opinions in the search world, as with the real world, don´t always agree.” Sullivan, supra note 2.
23

their vigorous claims to the contrary (and the fact that their results actually exhibit very
little bias).26
Several other methodological issues undermine the policy relevance of Edelman
& Lockwood´s analysis.

Edelman & Lockwood hand select 32 search queries and

execute searches on Google, Bing, Yahoo, AOL and Ask. Edelman & Lockwood´s hand‐
selected, non‐random sample of 32 search queries cannot generate reliable inferences
concerning the frequency of bias, a critical ingredient to understanding its potential
competitive effects. Indeed, Edelman & Lockwood concede their queries are chosen
precisely because they are likely to return results including Google content (e.g., email,
images, maps, video).27 The 32 search queries are:

Edelman & Lockwood analyze the top three organic search results for each query
on each engine. They find that 19% of all results across all five search engines refer to

content affiliated with one of them.28 Edelman & Lockwood focus upon the first three
organic results and report that Google refers to its own content in the first (ʺtopʺ)
position about twice as often as Yahoo and Bing refer to Google content in this position.
Additionally, they note that Yahoo is more biased than Google when evaluating the first
page rather than only the first organic search result.29
Edelman & Lockwood also offer a strained attempt to deal with the possibility of
what we´ve referred to as competitive product differentiation among search engines.
They discuss the possibility of “random variation across search engines.”30 However,
their evidence undermines claims that Google´s own‐content bias is significant and
systematic relative to its rivals´. In fact, almost zero evidence of statistically significant
own‐content bias by Google emerges.

Edelman & Lockwood examine differences

among search engines´ references to their own content by “compar[ing] the frequency
with which a search engine links to its own pages, relative to the frequency with which
other search engines link to that search engine´s pages.”31

Id. (“We preserved and analyzed the first page of results from each search . . . a significant fraction [of
results] – 19% – came from pages that were obviously affiliated with one of the five search engines.”).
29 On its first page, Yahoo refers to Yahoo content in 37 results, while Bing and Google refer to Yahoo
content in just 19 and 15 results, respectively. Meanwhile, Google both refers to its own content in fewer
instances and exhibits far less bias in its first page of results: Google refers to its own content in just 32
results; Yahoo refers to Google content in 28 results; and Bing refers to Google content in 26 results.
30 Id. This choice of terminology is misleading and obfuscates important and policy relevant economic
forces. Search engines do not randomly rank results. They are the product of competition, including
systematic and continually scrutinized algorithmic decisions – which are (1) unique to each engine and
simply cannot be expected to yield identical results (nor would such an outcome be desirable) and (2)
reflect search engines´ conscious decisions to focus upon different characteristics of search results within
their results.

Edelman & Lockwood find, in general, Google is no more likely to refer to its
own content than other search engines are to refer to that same content. While they do
find that both Google and Yahoo are significantly more likely to refer to their own
content in their first position than the other engines,32 this is an anomalous result.
Across vast majority of their results, Edelman & Lockwood find Google search results
are not statistically more likely to refer to Google content than rivals´ search results. For
example, Edelman & Lockwood find that Google is not more likely to refer to its own
content when focusing upon the entire first page or the Top 3 results.33 In an analysis of
90 common search terms in Google´s Keywords tool for “internet software,” they find
yet again that Google search results are not statistically significantly more likely to refer
to its own content than its rivals do, while Yahoo is significantly more likely to refer to
its own content than other search engines.34
Edelman & Lockwood’s same data can be examined to test the likelihood that a
search engine will refer to content affiliated with a rival search engine. Rather than
exhibiting bias in favor of an engine´s own content, it might conceivably be less likely to
Google´s odds ratio is 3.1 and is statistically significant at the 2% level, while Yahoo´s odds ratio is
higher at 3.3 and more statistically significant (at the 1% level). Id. at Table 3. An odds ratio of 1 indicates
that Google (Yahoo) refers to its own content at the same rate that other engines refer to Google (Yahoo)
content. Id.

34 Google´s odds ratio for its Top 1 result, Top 3 results, and First Page are 1.100, 1.207, and 1.084,
respectively; and Yahoo´s odds ratios for these iterations is 21.118, 2.984, and 2.327 and each is
statistically significant at the 1% level. Edelman & Lockwood find that Google, Bing and Yahoo all refer
to their own results more frequently than the other engines do in the full first page of results for these
searches when rich results are included. This finding, however, merely highlights the importance of
analyzing the actual effects of such rankings upon consumers, as such results are not only apparently the
industry standard, but also generally perceived as desirable by users.

Standard Errors in Parentheses

The first two columns of Table 1 demonstrate that, both Google and Yahoo
content are referred to in the first search result less frequently in rivals’ search results
than in their own. Although Bing does not have enough data for robust analysis of
results in the first position in Edelman & Lockwood´s original analysis, the next three
columns in Table 1 illustrate that all three engines’ (Google, Yahoo, and Bing) content
appears less often on the first page of rivals’ search results than on their own search
engine. However, only Yahoo’s results differ significantly from 1. As between Google
and Bing, the results are notably similar.
Edelman & Lockwood make a limited attempt to consider the possibility that
favorable placement of a search engine´s own content is a response to user preferences

rather than anticompetitive motives.

Using click‐through data, they find,

unsurprisingly, that the first search result tends to receive the most clicks, at an average
rate of 72%; while the second and third results receive on average 13% and 8% of clicks,
respectively. Furthermore, they identify one search term for which they believe bias
plays an important role in driving user traffic. For the search query “email,” Google
ranks its own Gmail first and Yahoo Mail second; however, Edelman & Lockwood also
find that Gmail receives only 29% of clicks while Yahoo Mail receives 54%. Edelman &
Lockwood assume that this finding strongly indicates that Google is engaging in
conduct that harms users and undermines their search experience. However, from a
competition analysis perspective, that inference is not sound. Indeed, the fact that the
second‐listed Yahoo Mail link received the majority of clicks demonstrates Yahoo was
not competitively foreclosed from access to users.

Taken collectively, Edelman &

Lockwood are not able to muster evidence of potential competitive foreclosure.35
Claiming that their results collectively identify prima facie evidence of inherently
anticompetitive search engine bias, Edelman & Lockwood argue that search engines
should be subject to more exacting scrutiny and regulatory involvement.36 FairSearch (a

Moreover, any number of other benign reasons could explain this anomalous ranking; for example,
users might realize after running this search that they know of a more efficient way of accessing Gmail, or
they may simply have clicked on Yahoo Mail first, immediately returned to the search page, and
subsequently clicked on Gmail. Sullivan, supra note 2. Note additionally that popularity is not always
equivalent to relevance. Id.

compilation of Google rivals) and others have embraced this concept, arguing that
Google should be condemned under antitrust laws for manipulating its results in its
favor.37
We agree it is important to have an evidence‐based discussion surrounding
search engine results and their competitive implications; but as we´ve observed, it is
critical to recognize that bias alone is not evidence of competitive harm and it must be
evaluated in the appropriate antitrust economic context of competition and consumers,
rather individual competitors and websites.38

Edelman & Lockwood´s analysis

provides a useful starting point for describing how search engines differ in their
referrals to their own content.

However, it is not useful from an antitrust policy

perspective because it erroneously—and contrary to economic theory and evidence—
presumes natural and procompetitive product differentiation in search rankings to be
inherently harmful.

Further, taken at face value, Edelman & Lockwood´s results

actually demonstrate little or no evidence of bias.

Replicating and Extending Edelman & Lockwood´s Analysis
Initially, we execute searches for Edelman & Lockwood´s original 32 non‐

random queries using three different search engines (Google, Bing, and Blekko) to

reflect developments in the modern search engine market and in an attempt to produce
results relevant to current policy debates.39 We record each organic search result on the
first page (up to twelve) as well as whether the result refers to Microsoft‐ or Google‐
affiliated sites or content.40 To replicate Edelman & Lockwood’s inclusion of Oneboxes
and other rich results (i.e., “universal” or “blended” results), we include them in our
analysis unless otherwise specified. We record screen shots of all the search results.41
This initial coding reveals that a total of 97 URLs across the three search engines refer to
Google content: Google, Bing and Blekko refer to Google content in 51, 26 and 20
results, respectively. A total of 74 URLs reference Microsoft content: Bing, Google, and
Blekko refer to Microsoft content in 56, 14 and 4 results, respectively.
Edelman & Lockwood´s search queries were recorded in August 2010. Search
technology has changed dramatically since then.42 Further, Bing now powers Yahoo,
and Blekko has had more time to mature and enhance its results. Blekko serves as a
helpful ʺcontrolʺ engine in this study as it is totally independent of Google and
We conducted all queries between June 23, 2011 and July 5, 2011.
Because Google, Bing, and Blekko do not always report URLs in the same manner, we gave each
Google‐ and Microsoft‐related URL a common name to facilitate comparisons. For instance, we coded
“maps.google.com/” as “Google Maps” and “office.microsoft.com/en‐us/excel” as “Microsoft Office.”

Microsoft, and thus has no incentive to refer to Google or Microsoft content unless it is
actually relevant to users. Blekko also provides an interesting comparison because its
general approach to search differs significantly from Google and Bing, which have more
in common.43 Blekko´s goal is to rid its results of spam entirely, and it employs slash
tags and user intervention to achieve its objectives.44 Thus, if Blekko, Google, and
Microsoft results for a particular query each agree that specific content is highly
relevant to the user query, it lends significant credibility to the notion that the content
places well on the merits rather than being attributable to bias or other factors.
It also bears repeating that our purpose in replicating and updating Edelman &
Lockwood is to develop a better and more contemporary description of how search
engines differ in their treatment of their own content. Yet it should be clear that we do
not believe our analysis of the non‐random Edelman & Lockwood sample provides
dispositive proof of the competitive nature and magnitude of any such bias.
Accordingly, to further develop an understanding of own‐content bias, we employ the
methodology just described to a random sample of 1,000 Google search queries.45 Note

direct evaluation of the critical link between competitive differentiation in organic
search and impact upon consumers. However, both analyses presented here are useful
first steps in documenting and evaluating differentiation in organic search results
among search engines and allow those data to be analyzed through the lens of antitrust
economic lens to assess the competitive implications of search bias.
III.

Replicating the Edelman & Lockwood Study
A. How Do Search Engines Rank Their Own Content?
Focusing solely upon the first position, Google refers to its own products or

services when no other search engine does in 21.9% of queries; in another 21.9% of
queries, both Google and at least one other search engine rival (i.e. Bing or Blekko) refer
to the same Google content with their first links. The following two charts illustrate the
percentage of Google or Bing first position results, respectively, dedicated to own
content across search engines.

allow researchers to study how people search for information online. We randomly selected 1,000 of
these queries for our sample. Searches were executed on these queries between July 20, 2011 and August
20, 2011.

22

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

Restricting focus upon the first position is too narrow.

Assuming that all

instances in which Google or Bing rank their own content first and rivals do not
amounts to bias would be a mistake; such a restrictive definition would include cases in
which all three search engines rank the same content prominently—agreeing that it is
highly relevant—though not all in the first position. The entire first page of results
provides a more informative comparison. We find that Google and at least one other
engine return Google content on the first page of results in 7% of the queries. Google
refers to its own content on the first page of results without agreement from either rival
search engine in only 7.9% of the queries. Meanwhile, Bing and at least one other
engine refer to Microsoft content in 3.2% of the queries. Bing references Microsoft
content without agreement from either Google or Blekko in 13.2% of the queries.

This evidence indicates that Google´s ranking of its own content differs
significantly from its rivals in only 7.9% of queries, and that when Google ranks its own
content prominently it is generally perceived as relevant. Further, these results suggest
that Bing´s organic search results are significantly more biased in favor of Microsoft
content than Google´s search results are in favor of Google´s content.
B. Examining Search Engine “Bias” on Google
Table 2 presents the percentages of queries for which Google´s ranking of its own
content differs significantly from its rivals´ ranking of that same content.

Note that percentages below 50 in Table 2 indicate that rival search engines
generally perceive the referenced Google content as relevant and independently believe
that it should be ranked similarly. When Google ranks its own content highly, at least
one rival engine typically agrees with this ranking; for example, when Google places its
own content in its Top 3 results, at least one rival agrees with this ranking in over 70%
of queries. Bing especially agrees with Google´s rankings of Google content within its
Top 3 and 5 results, failing to include Google content Google ranks thusly in less than
40% of queries.
Table 3 focuses upon the rare case in which Google ranks its own content within
the first page of results and rivals do not refer to the same content at all.

Table 3 further reveals a general consensus across search engines as to the
relevancy of Google content.

Particularly when Google ranks its own content

prominently, at least one rival engine agrees that this Google result belongs on the first
page; there is only one query for which Google refers to its own content in the first
position while no other engine references that same content anywhere on its first page.46
We also ran several simple regression models to compare the results from these
new data to Edelman & Lockwood’s results. Table 4 reports the likelihood Google
content will be referred to in a Google search result relative to searches performed on
rival engines.

Focusing upon Edelman & Lockwood´s small and non‐random sample of search
queries, the first and third columns report results indicating that Google affiliated
content is more likely to appear in a search executed on Google rather than rival
engines. Both Bing and Blekko are significantly less likely to refer to Google content in
their first result or on their first page. Interestingly, Bing’s first result is highly unlikely
to include Google content, and much less likely than Blekko.
C. Examining Search Engine ʺBiasʺ on Bing
Bing refers to Microsoft content in its search results far more frequently than its
rivals reference the same Microsoft content. For example, Bing´s top result references
Microsoft content for 5 queries, while neither Google nor Blekko ever rank Microsoft
content in the first position (see Table 5).

Table 5 illustrates the significant discrepancies between Bing´s treatment of its
own Microsoft content relative to Google and Blekko. Neither rival engine refers to
Microsoft content Bing ranks within its Top 3 results; Google and Blekko do not include
any Microsoft content Bing refers to on the first page of results in nearly 80% of queries.
Moreover, Bing frequently ranks Microsoft content highly even when rival
engines do not refer to the same content at all in the first page of results, as Table 6
demonstrates.

For example, of the 5 queries for which Bing ranks Microsoft content in its top
result, Google refers to only one of these 5 within its first page of results, while Blekko
refers to none. Even when comparing results across each engine´s full page of results,
Google and Blekko only agree with Bing´s referral of Microsoft content in 20.4% of
queries.
Simple regression analysis corroborates these results.

Table 7 shows the

likelihood of Microsoft content referred to in a Bing Search or other rivals’ search results
(reported in odds ratios).

Although there are not enough Bing data to test results in the first position in
Edelman & Lockwood´s sample, Microsoft content appears as results on the first page
of a Bing search about 7 times more often than Microsoft content appears on the first
page of rival engines. Also, Google is much more likely to refer to Microsoft content
than Blekko, though both refer to significantly less Microsoft content than Bing.
D. A Closer Look at Google v. Bing
By Edelman & Lockwood´s measure, Bing results are more biased than Google
results. The reason for this result is clear from the data. Bing´s own‐content referring
search results rank that content significantly higher than its rivals do more frequently
than Google does.

In other words, rivals are more likely to agree with Google´s

algorithmic assessment that its own content is relevant to user queries. Bing refers to
Microsoft content other engines do not rank at all more often than Google refers its own

content without any agreement from rivals. Figures 1 and 2 display the same data
presented above in order to facilitate direct comparisons between Google and Bing.

As Figures 1 and 2 illustrate, Bing search results for these 32 queries are more
frequently ʺbiasedʺ in favor of its own content than are Google´s. The bias is greatest

31

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

for the Top 1 and Top 3 search results. While it is important to stress Edelman &
Lockwood´s limited and non‐random sample, and to emphasize the danger of making
strong inferences about the general nature of magnitude of search bias based upon
these data alone, the data indicate that Google´s own‐content bias is relatively small
even in a sample collected precisely to focus upon the queries most likely to generate
it.47
Figures 3 and 4 present a direct head‐to‐head comparison of Bing and Google
(excluding Blekko from the analysis).

It is important to recognize that our definition of bias does not imply that either Google or Bing results
are ʺbiasedʺ in favor of own content as a result of manual manipulation of organic search results. The
definition employed here merely measures the differences among engines in how Google and Microsoft
content are displayed.

47

32

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

Notably, Bing ranks Microsoft content more prominently than Google´s content with
greater frequency than Google ranks its own content more favorably than Microsoft´s
content.48
E. Is Google Search Bias Consistent with Anticompetitive Foreclosure?
As we´ve repeatedly emphasized, while we describe differences among search
engines´ rankings of their own or affiliated content as ʺbias,ʺ without more these
differences do not imply anticompetitive conduct. It is wholly unsurprising and indeed
consistent with vigorous competition among engines that differentiation emerges with
respect to algorithms. However, it is especially important to note that the theories of

Our study finds that Bing exhibits far more “bias” than Edelman & Lockwood identify in their earlier
analysis. For example, in Edelman & Lockwood´s study, Bing does not refer to Microsoft content at all in
its Top 1 or Top 3 results; moreover, Bing refers to Microsoft content within its entire first page 11 times,
while Google and Yahoo refer to Microsoft content 8 and 9 times, respectively. Most likely, the
significant increase in Bing´s “bias” differential is largely a function of Bing´s introduction of localized
and personalized search results and represents serious competitive efforts on Bing´s behalf. Sullivan,
Bing Gets Localized and Personalized, supra note 42.

48

33

anticompetitive foreclosure raised by Google´s rivals involve very specific claims about
these differences. One necessary condition of these anticompetitive theories of own‐
content search bias is obvious: the bias must be sufficient in magnitude to exclude rival
search engines from achieving efficient scale.49 A corollary of this condition is that the
bias must actually be directed toward Google´s rivals. The condition is difficult to
evaluate with such a small non‐random sample of queries designed to generate results
with Google content; however, the fact that Google displays less own‐content bias than
its closest rival even in this sample designed to identify maximum bias, and that such
bias is nonetheless relatively infrequent, renders unsurprising our finding that the first
condition is also not satisfied in a larger universe of queries, as discussed below.
But are the few instances in which Google ranks its own content as more relevant
than its rivals consistent with claims of competitive foreclosure? Are these instances
tailored toward the exclusion of search and vertical search rivals? Consider the few
queries in the sample for which Google returned Google content within the top three
results but neither Bing nor Blekko referenced the same content anywhere on their first
page of results. For the query ʺvoicemail,ʺ Google refers to both Google Voice and
Google Talk; both instances appear unrelated to the grievances of general and vertical
search rivals. The query ʺmovieʺ results in a OneBox with the next 3 organic results
including movie.com, fandango.com, and yahoo.movies.com. The single instance in

Edelman & Lockwood´s sample for which Google ranks its own content in the Top 3
positions but this content is not referred to at all on Bing´s first page of results is a link
to blogger.com in response to the query ʺblog.ʺ Thus it appears that the small handful
of cases in which Google ranks its own content more favorably than its rivals is more
consistent with simple and expected competitive product differentiation than with
anticompetitive foreclosure.
In Part IV, we extend this analysis to a larger and random sample of actual
queries.
IV.

Own‐Content Bias With a Random Sample of 1,000 Search Queries
A. How Do Search Engines Rank Their Own Content?
Examining just the first position, we find that Google simply does not refer to its

own content in over 90% of queries.

Similarly, Bing does not reference Microsoft

content in 85.4% of queries. Google refers to its own content in the first position when
other search engines do not in only 6.7% of queries; while Bing does so over twice as
often, referencing Microsoft content that no other engine references in the first position
in 14.3% of queries. The following two charts illustrate the percentage of Google or
Bing first position results, respectively, dedicated to own content across search engines.

The most striking aspect of these results is the small fraction of queries for which
placement of own‐content is relevant. Similarly, when we expand consideration to the
entire first page of results we find that both Google and Bing do not return their own
content in over 90% of queries. Again, the fraction of queries for which placement of
own‐content is relevant is relatively small. Google returns its own content when no
other engine does for only 8.7% of queries, while Bing does so in a comparable 7.9% of
queries. Each engine returns own content that at least one other engine also returns on
its first page in less than 1% of queries.

Our data illustrate that levels of own‐content bias are similar between Google
and Bing when considering the entire first page of results, but that Bing is far more
likely than Google to reference its own content in its very first results position.
B. Examining Search Engine “Bias” on Google
We notice two distinct differences between the results of this larger study and
our replication of Edelman & Lockwood: (1) Google and Bing refer to their own content
in a significantly smaller percentage of cases here than in the non‐random sample; and
(2) in general, when Google or Bing does rank its own content highly, rival engines are
unlikely to similarly rank that same content.
Table 8 reports the percentages of queries for which Google´s ranking of its own
content and its rivals´ rankings of that same content differ significantly. When Google
refers to its own content within its Top 5 results, at least one other engine similarly
ranks this content for only about 5% of queries.

The first and third columns report results indicating that Google‐affiliated content is
more likely to appear in a search executed on Google rather than rival engines. Google
is approximately 16 times more likely to refer to its own content on its first page as is
any other engine. Bing and Blekko are both significantly less likely to refer to Google
content in their first result or on their first page than Google is to refer to Google content
within these same parameters. In each iteration, Bing is more likely to refer to Google
content than is Blekko, and, in the case of the first result, Bing is much more likely to do
so.
C. Examining Search Engine “Bias” on Bing
39

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

For queries within our larger sample, Bing refers to Microsoft content within its
Top 1 and 3 results when no other engine similarly references this content for a slightly
smaller percentage of queries than in our Edelman & Lockwood replication. Yet Table
11 illustrates that Bing continues to exhibit a strong tendency to rank Microsoft content
more prominently than rival engines rank it.

For example, when Bing refers to

Microsoft content within its Top 5 results, other engines agree with this ranking for less
than 2% of queries; and Bing refers to Microsoft content that no other engine does
within its Top 3 results for 99.2% of queries.

This trend holds when the analysis expands to consider the entire first page of
results. As Table 12 presents, when Bing references Microsoft content in its first results
position, no other engine references this same content at all on its first page of results
for 97.9% of queries. In fact, when Bing refers to Microsoft content in any of its Top 1, 3,

Bing refers to Microsoft content in its first results position about 56 times more often
than rival engines refer to Microsoft content in this same position. Across the entire
first page, Microsoft content appears on a Bing search about 25 times more often than it
does on any other engine. Both Google and Blekko are accordingly significantly less
likely to reference Microsoft content. Notice further that, contrary to the findings in the
pilot study, Google is slightly less likely to return Microsoft content than is Blekko, both
in its first results position and across its entire first page.
D. A Closer Look at Google v. Bing
Consistent with our smaller sample, we find again that Bing is more biased than
Google using these metrics. In other words, Bing ranks its own content significantly
more highly than its rivals do more frequently then Google does, although the
discrepancy between the two engines is smaller here than in the pilot study. As noted

E. Is Google Search Bias Consistent with Anticompetitive Foreclosure?
A key antitrust question related to search bias is whether the observed bias, if
any, is consistent with the competitive foreclosure arguments raised by Google’s critics
and rivals.

As we have emphasized throughout this paper, vertical foreclosure

arguments are premised upon the notion that rivals are excluded with sufficient
frequency and intensity as to render their efforts to compete for distribution futile. Our
results simply do not support these claims of market conditions conducive to the types
of harmful exclusion contemplated by application of the antitrust laws. Rather, the
evidence indicates that (1) the absolute level of search engine “bias” is extremely low,
and (2) “bias” is not a function of market power, but an effective strategy that has arisen
as a result of serious competition and innovation between and by search engines. The
first finding would undermine competitive foreclosure arguments on their own terms,
that is, even if there were no pro‐consumer justifications for the integration of Google
content with Google search results. The second finding, even more importantly, reveals
that the evolution of consumer preferences for more sophisticated and useful search
results has driven rival search engines to satisfy that demand. Both Bing and Google
both have shifted toward these results, rendering the complained‐of conduct equivalent
to satisfying the standard of care in the industry.
A significant lack of search bias emerges in our representative sample of queries.
The total percentage of queries for which Google references its own content when rivals

46

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

do not is quite low—only about 8%—meaning that Google favors its own content far
less often than critics have suggested. This fact is crucial and highly problematic for
search engine critics, as their burden in articulating a cognizable antitrust harm includes
not only demonstrating that bias exists, but further that it (1) is competitively harmful,
and (2) occurs at sufficient levels to actually exclude rivals. As discussed, bias alone is
simply not sufficient to demonstrate any prima facie anticompetitive harm—as it is far
more often procompetitive or competitively neutral than actively harmful. Moreover,
given that bias occurs in less than 10% of queries run on Google, anticompetitive
exclusion arguments appear unsustainable.
Indeed, we find that theories of vertical foreclosure find virtually zero empirical
support in our data.

Moreover, it appears that, rather than being a function of

monopolistic abuse of power, search bias has emerged as an efficient competitive
strategy, allowing search engines to differentiate their products in ways that benefit
consumers. We find that when search engines do reference their own content on their
search results pages, it is generally unlikely that another engine will reference this same
content. However, that both this percentage and the absolute level of own content
inclusion is similar across engines indicates that this practice is not derivative of one’s
misuse of its market power, but an industry standard. In fact, despite conducting a
much smaller percentage of total consumer searches, Bing is consistently more biased
than Google, illustrating that the benefits search engines enjoy from integrating their

47

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

own content into results is not necessarily a function of search engine size or volume of
queries. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the business practice at
issue is efficient and at significant tension with arguments that such integration is
designed to facilitate competitive foreclosure.
Inclusion of own content accordingly appears to be just one dimension upon
which search engines have endeavored to satisfy and anticipate heterogeneous and
dynamic consumer preferences. Consumers today likely make strategic decisions as to
which engine to run their searches on, and certainly expect engines to return far more
complex results than were available—and the industry standard—just a few years ago.51
While the traditional 10 blue links results page is simply not an effective competitive
strategy today, it appears that own‐content inclusion is.52 By developing and offering
their own products in search results, engines are better able to directly satisfy consumer
desires. For example, when Google or Bing returns its own map in response to a search
run for “maps,” consumers can click once and arrive at their desired outcome—rather

For example, over the last few years, search engines have begun “personalizing” search results,
tailoring results pages to individual searchers, and allowing users´ preferences to be reflected over time.
See, e.g., Danny Sullivan, Google Now Personalizes Everyone’s Search Results, SEARCH ENGINE LAND (Dec. 4,
2009, 6:18 PM), http://searchengineland.com/google‐now‐personalizes‐everyones‐search‐results‐31195
(“For example, let´ s say someone else prefers Barnes & Nobles. Over time, Google learns that person
likes Barnes & Noble. They begin to see even more Barnes & Nobles listings, rather than Amazon ones.”).
See also supra note 42.
52 See, e.g., Greg Sterling, Yahoo: We’re Moving from Web of Pages to Web of Objects, SEARCH ENGINE LAND
(May 19, 2009, 4:36 PM), http://searchengineland.com/yahoo‐were‐moving‐from‐web‐of‐pages‐to‐web‐of‐
objects‐19524 (“The big idea (now familiar) is moving beyond ‘10 blue links’ (popularized as a criticism of
search by former Ask CEO Jim Lanzone) to a ‘web of objects.’ The ‘web of objects’ presented by Yahoo is
a better representation of the ‘real world’ in search results. In other words: more closely aligning user
intent with search results and mapping those to real‐world tasks.”).

than having to click to another site, locate the map on its site, and finally engage in their
desired activity.
Our evidence reveals very little search engine bias, and no overwhelming or
systematic biasing by Google against vertical or general search competitors. To the
contrary, our results strongly suggest that own‐content bias fosters natural and
procompetitive product differentiation. Accordingly, search bias is likely beneficial to
consumers—and is clearly not indicative of harm to consumer welfare.
V.

Conclusion
Competition among search engines can be expected to result in different

rankings of any number of websites, including those featuring their own or affiliated
content, as engines compete for diverse consumers with heterogeneous preferences.
Using a small and non‐random sample designed to maximize the incidence of search
bias, Edelman & Lockwood misinterpret their own findings to conclude that search bias
is not only prevalent, but sufficient to warrant antitrust intervention. Our critique,
replication and extension of Edelman & Lockwood´s analysis suggest these concerns are
overstated and misguided. Most importantly, the authors treat “bias” as inherently and
deeply suspect, do not engage in any analysis of its actual competitive effects, and
simply disregard the well‐known procompetitive explanations for vertical integration.
This analysis is perverse from an antitrust perspective precisely because it ignores the
welfare of consumers in favor of focusing upon individual websites.

49

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

Our analysis finds that own‐content bias is a relatively infrequent phenomenon.
Google references its own content more favorably than rival search engines for only a
small fraction of terms, whereas Bing is far more likely to do so. For example, in our
replication of Edelman & Lockwood, Google refers to its own content in its first page of
results when its rivals do not for only 7.9% of the queries, whereas Bing does so nearly
twice as often (13.2%). Further, using Edelman & Lockwood’s own data, neither Bing
nor Google demonstrates much bias when considering Microsoft or Google content,
respectively, referred to on the first page of search results. Collectively, rivals do not
mention Google (or Microsoft) content any less often than Google (or Bing) mentions its
own content. In our analysis of a large, random sample of search queries we find that
Bing generally favors Microsoft content more frequently—and far more prominently—
than Google favors its own content. Google references own content in its first results
position when no other engine does in just 6.7% of queries, while Bing again does so
over twice as often (14.3%). When search engines appear to rank their own content
more prominently in these samples, it is clear both Bing and Google do so. Indeed, Bing
appears to be more biased than Google.
Moreover, the remaining bias appears to be much more consistent with natural
and procompetitive product differentiation than with anticompetitive foreclosure.
These few results did not involve attempts to prominently display Google´s own
general or vertical search content over that of rivals. Consistent with these data, and as

50

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

others have observed, if Google were foreclosing search rivals from prominent display
in its organic search results, one would expect the bias to be present for the query
ʺsearch engine,ʺ with Google favoring its own core business at the expense of leading
search rivals.53 Instead, a side‐by‐side comparison of Google and Bing results for that
query demonstrates that Google not only is not prominently ranked, but that Google
does not reference its own search engine at all; perhaps this is because its algorithm
figures that if the user is entering the query from Google he or she already knows how
to find it. However, Google´s chief search rivals fare quite well on Google compared to
Google´s rank on Bing, where it appears tenth. While such evidence is anecdotal, the
limited evidence available is facially inconsistent with the theories of anticompetitive
foreclosure proffered by Google´s critics.

Sullivan, supra note 2 (“Having watched this results set for literally years, I´m borderline believing that
rather than favoring itself, Google is deliberately downgrading itself here, as a way to show the world
how it doesn´t favor itself.”).
53

51

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

From an antitrust perspective, as we´ve explained, differences in own‐content
references across engines fail to indicate consumer harm; to the contrary, it is quite
possible—and indeed likely—that these differences imply the existence of intense
competition among engines. For bias to have antitrust relevance, it must be linked to an
analysis of its impact upon consumer welfare.

In order to generate plausible

competitive concerns, search engine bias must be both prevalent and sufficient in

52

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2004649

magnitude to deprive rivals of efficient scale, exclude rivals on grounds other than
superior quality, and reduce consumer welfare.
Evaluation of our large random sample of user queries significantly improves
our understanding of competitive differences among search engines both generally and
with respect to ranking their own content. However, all of the data presented here—
our large study, our replication of Edelman & Lockwood, and Edelman & Lockwood´s
own analysis—simply do not support claims that own‐content bias is of the nature,
quality, or magnitude to generate plausible antitrust concerns.

Indeed, antitrust

regulators should proceed with caution when evaluating such claims given the
overwhelmingly consistent economic learning concerning the competitive benefits of
vertical integration for consumers.54 Serious care must be taken so as not to deter
vigorous competition between search engines and the natural competitive process
between rivals constantly vying to best one another to serve consumers.
