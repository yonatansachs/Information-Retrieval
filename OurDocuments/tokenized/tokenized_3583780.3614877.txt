abstract
ranking
systems
are
the
key
components
of
modern
information
retrieval
ir
applications
such
as
search
engines
and
recommender
systems
besides
the
ranking
relevance
to
users
the
exposure
fair
ness
to
item
providers
has
also
been
considered
an
important
factor
in
ranking
optimization
many
fair
ranking
algorithms
have
been
proposed
to
jointly
optimize
both
ranking
relevance
and
fairness
however
we
find
that
most
existing
fair
ranking
methods
adopt
greedy
algorithms
that
only
optimize
rankings
for
the
next
imme
diate
session
or
request
as
shown
in
this
paper
such
myopic
paradigm
could
limit
the
upper
bound
of
ranking
optimization
and
lead
to
suboptimal
performance
in
the
long
term
to
this
end
we
propose
fara
novel
future-aware
ranking
algorithm
for
ranking
relevance
and
fairness
optimization
instead
of
greedily
optimizing
rankings
for
the
next
immediate
session
fara
plans
ahead
by
jointly
optimizing
multiple
ranklists
together
and
saving
them
for
future
sessions
specifically
fara
first
uses
the
taylor
expansion
to
investigate
how
future
ranklists
will
influ
ence
the
overall
fairness
of
the
system
then
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
taylor
expansion
fara
adopts
two-phase
optimization
algorithm
where
we
first
solve
an
optimal
future
exposure
plan
ning
problem
and
then
construct
the
optimal
ranklists
according
to
the
optimal
future
exposure
planning
theoretically
we
show
that
fara
is
optimal
for
ranking
relevance
and
fairness
joint
op
timization
empirically
our
extensive
experiments
on
three
semi
synthesized
datasets
show
that
fara
is
efficient
effective
and
can
deliver
significantly
better
ranking
performance
compared
to
state-of-the-art
fair
ranking
methods
we
make
our
implementation

introduction
ranking
systems
are
one
of
the
important
cornerstones
of
informa
tion
retrieval
ir
existing
ranking
systems
are
usually
constructed
to
optimize
ranking
relevance
with
the
probability
ranking
prin
ciple
prp
34
where
items
of
greater
likely
relevance
should
be
ranked
higher
the
prp
is
user-centered
ranking
strategy
that
helps
save
users
energy
and
time
since
users
could
satisfy
their
needs
with
the
top-ranked
items
18
however
recent
research
has
shown
that
besides
users
item
providers
also
draw
utility
from
ranking
systems
and
the
prp
could
result
in
severe
unfairness
for
item
providers
37
particularly
the
prp
always
assigns
few
top
items
with
high-rank
positions
those
top
items
usually
get
the
ma
jority
of
exposure
while
other
items
rarely
get
exposure
although
other
items
might
still
be
relevant
19
29
40
49
the
unbalanced
exposure
leads
to
unfair
opportunities
and
unfair
economic
gains
for
item
providers
such
unfairness
will
eventually
force
unfairly
treated
providers
to
leave
the
system
and
fewer
options
will
be
left
for
users
51
therefore
ir
researchers
have
argued
that
ranking
relevance
and
fairness
are
both
important
for
modern
ranking
sys
tems
37
38
many
fair
ranking
algorithms
have
been
proposed
to
optimize
both
of
them
jointly
29
55
however
existing
fair
algorithms
are
mostly
greedy
algorithms
and
could
only
deliver
suboptimal
ranking
performance
in
the
long
run
in
particular
existing
fair
ranking
algorithms
24
26
37
47
usually
behave
greedily
to
sequentially
produce
the
locally
optimal
ranklist
for
the
next
immediate
session
without
being
aware
of
the
influence
of
future
sessions1
see
more
discussion
in
the
unawareness
could
lead
to
unmitigated
ranking
conflict
between
relevance
and
fairness
optimization
for
example
imagine
case
that
there
are
in
total
items
in
consideration
item

and
in
this
paper
we
define

is
the
most
relevant

and

is

ranklist
is
the
ranklist
to
maximize

we
now
consider
scenario
where
item
is
severely
unfairly
treated
in
history
to
optimize
exposure
fairness
we
need
to
allocate
item
more
exposure
by
boosting
item
to
higher
position
however
if
we
try
to
greedily
boost
item
within
the
next
immediate
session
it
is
highly
likely
that
item
will
be
boosted
to
the
first
rank
to
get
the
maximum
exposure
and
the
result
ranklist
is
however
ranklist
is
of
poor
ranking
relevance
due
to
the
ranking
conflict
that
the
least
relevant
item
item
is
put
on
the
most
important
rank
the
first
rank
intuitively
the
ranking
conflict
can
be
smoothed
if
we
plan
ahead
and
jointly
optimize
multiple
future
sessions
ranklists
to
gether
instead
of
greedily
optimizing
the
next
immediate
session
for
example
the
multiple
ranklists
after

optimization
can
be
where
item
is
smoothly
boosted
in

the
most
relevant

still

is
defined
as
we
should
let

in
this
paper
we
choose
the
exposure
fairness
evaluation
proposed
by
oosterhuis
26
instead
of
the
original
evaluation
proposed
in
37
the
reason
for
the
choice
is
that
the
fairness
evaluation
in
37
needs
to
divide
the
exposure
of
an
item
by
its
relevance
which
has
zero

problem
when

is

and

therefore
they
usually
fail
to

if
we
expect

furthermore
based

the

that

there

algorithm
to

the

of

21
one
example
of
discontinuity
is
that
increasing
an
item

score
may
not
change
the

and
fair

stays
the

in

all

which
means
there
exists
tradeoff
between

cndcg
the
reason
behind
this
tradeoff
is
that
requiring
more
fairness
will
bring
more
constraints
on
optimizing
effectiveness
since
topk
and
randomk
do
not
have
trade-off
parameters
both
of

only
have

in

our

fara
and

outperform

since
our

reach
the

given
the

and
fara

is
consistent
in
both
post-processing

all
fair

are
effective
fair

algorithms
since
they
all
show
the
tradeoff
higher
cndcg
when
increasing
the
unfair
ness
tolerance
for
unfair
algorithms
topk
performs
differently
in
post-processing
and
online
settings
in
the
post-processing
setting
topk
reaches
the
highest
cndcg
since
relevance
is
known
and
ranking
relevance
is
the
only
consideration
however
in
the
online
setting
topk
can
not
reach
the
highest
cndcg
we
think
the
drop
in
cndcg
is
that
topk
naively
trusts
the
relevance
estimation
with
out
any
exploration
when
optimizing
ranking
relevance
however
fair
algorithms
are
shown
to
be
robust
to
the
online
setting
since
they
mostly
can
reach
better
cndcg
than
topk
when
increasing
unfairness
tolerance
we
think
the
reason
for
the
robustness
is
that
fair
algorithms
usually
rerank
items
for
different
sessions
to
optimize
fairness
and
such
reranking
brings
explorations

what
is

time
efficient
on

and
istella-s
although
all
three
of
them
are
programming-based
methods
there
are
two
reasons
behind
fara
time
efficiency
the
first
one
is
that
fara
has
much
fewer
number
of
decision
variables
since
fara
only
has
decision
variables
while
ilp
and
lp
have
decision
variables
the
second
one
is
that
fara
does
not
need
to
solve
quadratic
programming
for
every
time
step
by
solving
quadratic
programming
once
we
can
get
ranklists

for

ablation

of

in

the
higher

the
better
their
performances

future
sessions
fara
can
reach
comparable
time
efficiency
with
non-programming-based
algorithms
like
topk
randomk
and
fairco
compared
with
those
non-programming-based
algorithms
the
slightly
additional
time
cost
of
fara
is
acceptable
given
fara
superior
ranking
performance
in
tab
and
in
fig
6.2
how
does
influence
fara
in
figure
we
show
the
results
of
cndcg
and
unfairness
by
varying
the
value
of
with
greater
we
see
clear
boost
of
cndcg
for
fara
while
such
boost
does
not
happen
for
fara-horiz
we
know
that
the
pro
posed
vertical
allocation
is
the
key
reason
to
have
better-ranking
relevance
when
we
get
the
optimal
exposure
planning
and
we
theoretically
analyze
the
reason
in
5.2
besides
as
we
increase
unfairness
does
not
vary
much
and
its
value
stays
close
to
the
minimum
unfairness
we
can
achieve
in
table
we
think
the
reason
for
the
steady
value
of
unfairness
is
that
fara
already
reaches
the
upper
limit
of
fairness
when
is
small
and
it
is
hard
to
improve
when
we
increase
6.2
how
does
exploration
influence
fara
in
the
online
setting
to
study
how
the
exploration
part
the
slack
variables
in
eq
14a
influences
fara
we
did
an
ablation
study
for
fara
with
or
with
out
exploration
due
to
the
page
limit
we
only
show
the
ablation
results
on
the
larger
dataset
mslr10k
and
istella-s
in
fig
ure
the
advantage
of
exploration
is
two-folded
based
on
figure
firstly
fara
lies
higher
than
fara-w
o-exp
in
the
figure
which
suggests
exploration
leads
to
better
effectiveness-fairness
balance
secondly
fara
has
smaller
lower
bound
of
unfairness
tolerance
which
implies
exploration
enables
fara
to
have
higher
fairness
capacity
and
can
meet
more
strict
fairness
requirement
