In this exploratory and qualitative study, we investigate the experience
of two groups of adults with visual disabilities in two science museums
in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Data collection was performed by recording
their visits through a subjective camera placed on the head of one of
the visitors. The analysis used three accessibility indicators and barriers
as codes. The data reveals that: (a) physical accessibility—related to the
internal architectural aspects—was well developed; although other elements
of this indicator need improvement; (b) attitudinal accessibility was present,
mostly due to the work and guidance of the museums’ educators; (c)
communicational accessibility was rare in the museums, either due to a lack
of diversiﬁed equipment, media or resources both for internal and external
communication; (d) barriers do exist, mainly because one or more element
is missing from the accessibility indicators. This study indicates that the two
science museums offer accessibility strategies from the perspective of people
with visual disabilities and can provide interactions, learning and science
communication for this audience in different levels. However, some barriers
in both institutions still need to be improved. Based on our data, results and
discussions, museums and their professionals can be inspired, learn and plan
an organizational change toward accessibility. Lastly, museums need to be
able to learn from people with disabilities.

Introduction
Access to quality education and accurate scientiﬁc information, to be part of cultural
life, enjoy the arts and participate in any community social activity are the rights of
every person, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN, 1948). For
people with disabilities, these rights are reinforced by a set of laws and international
Frontiers in Education

conventions—such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities (CRPD) (UN, 2006)—which is aligned with
the human rights (Ollerton and Horsfall, 2013). Argyropoulos
and Kanari (2019, p. 125) explain that “educational policies and
initiatives toward an inclusive society have become more and
more intensive in the last decades” and that the focus on the
right to participate in diﬀerent sectors of social life, education
and culture are based on the adoption of the social model of
disability.
The idea that it is possible to learn science outside of school
also grew and was incentivized both in theory and practice
throughout the years, as seen in the editorial organized by
Longnecker et al. (2022). Science museums are considered non-
formal learning environments (Bell et al., 2009) and signiﬁcant
places for leisure, engagement and science communication (Falk
and Dierking, 2002; Schiele, 2014). Through their exhibitions
and activities, museums can facilitate learning (Marandino et al.,
2018) in a multidimensional way (Hooper-Greenhill, 1994,
2006). As Hooper-Greenhill (2006) states, learning in museums
is based on experience, because they provide opportunities for
people to perform, touch, interact through their diﬀerent senses,
and feel engaged and immersed.
In this way, in science museums, people can explore
their interest in subjects related to science and practice skills
related to science learning as logical reasoning, observation,
and hypotheses construction (Norberto Rocha, 2018; Massarani
et al., 2022a). Thus, people can “build upon, reinforce
and strengthen their own preferred, pre-existing science
understandings” (Falk and Dierking, 2019, p. 3). Visitors
can choose when and how they want to learn, driven
by their emotions, personal stories, and motivations—what
is called “free-choice” learning (Falk and Dierking, 2002).
These institutions are, thus, platforms for scientiﬁc citizenship
(Bandelli, 2014) which can provide educational opportunities
for all people to learn and engage at any age (O’Brien and
Candlin, 2001).
As such, they need to be capable of facilitating social
inclusion and the democratization of knowledge and of
catering to a broad and diverse audience (Sandell, 2002;
Bevan and Ramos, 2021). On this subject, during the last
decades, worldwide, museums have worked on establishing
relationships
with
people
with
disabilities,
primarily
by
providing more accessible and barrier-free physical spaces
(Sandell et al., 2010). Studies also indicate that museums try
to promote “organizational change” and make institutional
learning increasingly inclusive (Reich et al., 2011; Reich, 2014);
they are developing programs and strategies and launching
speciﬁc initiatives to target diﬀerent audiences (Norberto Rocha
et al., 2020a; Norberto Rocha, 2021).
In the speciﬁc context of Latin America, the Guia de
Museus e Centros de Ciências Acessíveis da América Latina e
do Caribe (Norberto Rocha et al., 2017) shows that accessibility
is being practiced by at least 110 science museums in various
forms. However, the study based on the data collected for
this document reveals challenges faced by these institutions.
Norberto Rocha et al. (2020b) exposed that the museums
tend to emphasize physical accessibility and provide only a
limited number of activities related to the attitudinal and
communicational aspects of inclusion—which are essential to
learning and engagement. This means that museums have
already progressed in promoting access to their physical spaces,
but devote insuﬃcient attention to the resources and strategies
that can facilitate learning in a non-formal environment.
Argyropoulos and Kanari (2019) mention that diﬀerent
types of disabilities require corresponding strategies and, what’s
more, that within a group of people with disabilities, there
is heterogeneity and speciﬁc needs and ways of promoting
inclusion. Related to individuals with visual disabilities, the
authors acknowledge they still face many barriers to visiting,
such as misunderstandings regarding the heterogeneity of
people with visual disabilities, limited or temporary options
oﬀered for blind visitors, attitudinal barriers, and a lack of
accessible web sites and publicity. Moreover, they state that “it
seems that due to lack of permanent access facilitations in many
museums people with visual disability face many diﬃculties
if they want to visit them spontaneously” (Argyropoulos
and Kanari, 2019, p. 131–132). The ability to visit museums
spontaneously is part of what people with disabilities might
consider autonomy and independent living, which are a central
demand on the agenda of people with disabilities’ rights (Oliver,
2013).
The study of Norberto Rocha et al. (2020a,b) on the
Latin American science museums and centers explicates these
institutions’ point of view on accessibility. However, studies
on how people with disabilities experience museum visits are
still needed, from their own perspectives, as protagonists of the
inclusion agenda (Levent et al., 2013). Given that experience is
a central part of museums’ learning (Falk and Dierking, 2002,
Hooper-Greenhill, 2006; Argyropoulos and Kanari, 2019), it is
essential to understand how visitors with disabilities interact
with the exhibits and the museum professionals—mainly the
educators—and how they face barriers. Along the same lines,
Levent and Reich (2013) state that learning from the visitor
experience is essential to improving museums’ interactions with
visitors, their services, and their educational environment.
Under these circumstances, in this study, we aimed to
investigate the experience of two groups of adults with
visual disabilities in two science museums in Rio de Janeiro
(Brazil), focusing on aspects of physical, attitudinal and
communicational accessibility and barriers. We examine how
they use accessibility resources, interact with the exhibitions
and professionals, overcome barriers, and potentially learn
in these non-formal education places. Finally, we provide
some discussion based on the evidence collected and the
study’s limitations.

Materials and methods
The methods of this exploratory and qualitative study
were grounded in previous research involvement developed for
investigating the experience of diﬀerent audiences in science
museums, e.g., teenagers (Massarani et al., 2019a,b,c, 2022a;
Norberto Rocha et al., 2021b, 2022; Coelho et al., 2022), families
(Massarani et al., 2021, 2022b; Scalﬁet al., 2022) and people with
disabilities (Do Carmo, 2021).
In these prior studies, professionals from Brazil, Argentina,
Colombia, Uruguay, Mexico and the USA developed protocols
for collecting data with a “subjective camera” method by which
an audio and video recording of visitors’ interactions and
conversations in a museum is taken by a camera placed on
the head of one of the visitors. After collecting this audiovisual
material, software is used to code the gathered data in order to
examine which elements of the experience can inﬂuence visitors’
participation in museums. The codes are based on pre-deﬁned
categories retrieved from analysis frameworks.
This data collection protocol and analysis was reliable when
applied to diﬀerent types of audiences and, in the current
study, we apply it to another group of visitors—adults with
visual disabilities, who have not been extensively studied in the
academic ﬁeld of visitor studies (Fernandes, 2020).
Participants with visual disabilities
Participants were invited by the non-probability sampling
technique known as snowball sampling (Biernacki and Waldorf,
1981; Bernard, 2005). This method is suitable for ﬁnding study
participants who may be diﬃcult to identify through other
recruitment methods (Hennink et al., 2011). This technique
relies on discovering a “strategically important contact” who can
help ﬁnd additional contacts that ﬁt the characteristics of the
desired target population (Henn et al., 2013) and has been used
in several previous studies on museum visitors’ experience.
The participants of this study were a heterogeneous group
of volunteers with visual disabilities: three men and two women,
aged between 23 and 60 years (Table 1). Their educational level
varied from elementary to graduate school. The visual disability
of each participant varied between total blindness and low
vision. These terms are based on the International Classiﬁcation
of Functionality, Disability and Health and the World Health
Organization, which deﬁne parameters for each degree of visual
impairment. We can classify blindness and low vision according
to the visual acuity of each individual. We consider people blind
if they have a visual ﬁeld of less than 10◦and having low vision
if they have 20◦in the best eye (Cieza et al., 2021). We also chose
to work with people who were both engaged and not engaged
with museums’ culture to reﬂect diﬀerent levels of interest and
participation in cultural life.
The ﬁrst group of visitors was composed of three people,
identiﬁed by us as “engaged visitors” (EVs). The group
was characterized by signiﬁcant personal involvement with
museums: either through a professional relationship or interest
and previous social life experiences. Also, they demonstrated
expertise and knowledge regarding accessibility strategies in
these spaces. They had secondary and higher education degrees
and were either totally blind, with white blindness (a lack of light
and ﬁgure perception) since childhood, or had experienced low
vision for more than 5 years.
The second group of visitors comprises two people
identiﬁed
as
“low-engaged
visitors”
(LEVs).
The
group
members’ connection with museums’ activities was low, since
they declared they had not regularly participated in these
activities or even had never been to a museum. They had
become totally blind in adulthood and completed middle and
high school. We therefore consider the group as little engaged
in this type of social activity.
The two groups visited the two museums in August and
September of 2019, but at diﬀerent times to avoid any interplay
between them. Both museums oﬀered the visits entirely guided
by museum educators.
The museums: A natural history
museum and a science center
The two Brazilian science museums studied are in Rio de
Janeiro and consist of a natural history museum and a hands-
on science center. Both have free admission and state that they
provide accessibility for people with disabilities. The museums
were chosen after their presentation on their accessibility
strategies at the 3rd National Meeting of the Brazilian
Association of Science Centers and Museums (ABCMC), which
demonstrated they were working toward the same aim, but in
diﬀerent stages of development.
The natural history museum, the Museu da Geodiversidade
(MGeo) at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, addresses
the history of Planet Earth and its evolution over the years. Its
extensive exhibitions contain eleven rooms with interconnected
themes, displaying rocks, fossils, and specimens—the majority
of which are original, in glass cases, or prepared for viewing
only. Some exhibits can be touched, e.g., the representation of
the Planet Earth, rocks, minerals, the reproduction of the jaw of
the largest Brazilian alligator, shells, etc. In part of the exhibition,
there are a few braille labels, tactile mini dioramas of specimens,
other tactile representations, and audio recordings.
The Casa da Descoberta (CD) at Universidade Federal
Fluminense is a hands-on science center consisting of one large
exhibition hall with exhibits spread throughout the space. The
central theme of the hands-on exhibits is physics, but they also
explore some chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, and biology.
Many exhibits are those traditionally presented in hands-on

science centers, such as the Van Der Graaﬀgenerator, pulley

power-generating bicycle, and power-generating crank. All
visitors can touch them, and none provide braille or multimedia
strategies. The only exhibition that presents accessible resources
is about optics and was specially made for audiences with
visual disabilities.
Data collection and analysis
Data was collected by recording the visits of the two groups
to the two museums in total, using the “subjective camera”
method (Burris, 2017). As in the previous studies using the same
method, a GoPro
R⃝camera was placed on a participant’s head for
each group.
Five hours of recording were collected and the software
Dedoose was used to code audiovisual excerpts through
qualitative analysis. As in previous studies, the data were
analyzed and coded from a qualitative perspective—the excerpts
were coded according to the duration of the experience that
naturally occurred. This means that a speciﬁc excerpt started
when we interpreted that one or a set of actions, conversations,
and interactions that ﬁt in one of the codes began until the end
of these actions.
For coding the excerpts, we applied the framework
“Accessibility Indicators of Science Museums” (Table 2)
proposed by the Accessible Science Museums and Centers
(MCCAC) research group (Inacio, 2017; Norberto Rocha et al.,
2020b). This framework was constructed based on a literature
review and the study of practical norms of accessibility. Since
its development, it has been applied to several studies. For
instance, Norberto Rocha et al. (2020b) presented a panorama
of the provision of accessibility of Latin-American institutions,
Do Carmo (2021) used it to study the experience of deaf people
in three diﬀerent exhibitions in the city of Tomaz Silva (2022)
applied it to investigate how the Museum of Tomorrow provides
accessibility for visitors with Down’s Syndrome. Diﬀerent
researchers used indicators to create analysis frameworks,
especially in science education and communication, museology,
accessibility, and their interconnections (Marandino et al.,
2018).
Physical accessibility: the two attributes of this indicator are
related to the physical and architectural aspects of the museum,
its infrastructure and surroundings, and the design of the
exhibition and its displays. With this indicator, we can identify
the characteristics that respect and value the diﬀerent abilities
and physical bodies of the visitors when interacting with the
exhibitions, activities, objects and the museums’ physical space.
Attitudinal accessibility: the ﬁrst attribute of this indicator
is aimed at attitudes and actions to eliminate prejudices,
stereotypes, and stigmas toward people with disabilities. The
second examines political aspects, such as the institution’s
mission to promote accessibility, the qualiﬁcation of human
resources [such as museum educators], and the incentives,
programs, and actions that facilitate accessibility.
Communicational accessibility: this indicator highlights
the characteristics of equipment and resources that allow
overcoming
interpersonal,
written,
and/or
informative
communication barriers. The ﬁrst attribute of communicational
accessibility refers to the internal and external communication,
which provides information about the functioning of the space
(days and times, location, ticket price, etc.) and the contents of
the exhibitions and objects of the museum itself. The second
attribute refers to diversiﬁed media that facilitates content
communication with visitors.
Lastly, barriers include obstacles, non-inclusive practices,
missed opportunities and untapped adaptations, whether
identiﬁed by the visitor, researcher or reported by the museum
team (museum educator, coordinator, etc.).
In the coding process, each attribute of each indicator was
considered a “code.” It is worth mentioning that the codes are
not mutually exclusive, meaning that more than one code may
be applied to a given excerpt, with overlapping durations.
Results
A total of 5 h and 31 min were analyzed in the software, in
which a total of 449 codes were applied. Attitudinal accessibility
was highly coded in the two museums: a total of 93 codes
were used, comprising 1 h and 20 min of duration. Following,
there was a large number of codes for Physical accessibility: 80
codes and 2 h and 53 min of duration. The Communicational
Accessibility coding had a total of 24 and 52 min of total
duration. Regarding the barriers, there were 47 codes and
43 min of duration.

Adapted from Norberto Rocha et al. (2020b).
As it is an exploratory and qualitative study, the numbers
(which means the frequency and duration of codes) helped
to provide an introductory panorama of the data. Exploring
the coded excerpts in depth was able to provide a better
understanding of each category and interpretation of the
visitors’ interactions, potential learning moments, and the
nature of the barriers confronted. In the following sections,
we present the analysis by each accessibility indicator using
examples of transcribed excerpts of the audiovisual recorded
data to illustrate our arguments.
Physical accessibility
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
architecture
and
infrastructure, both museums were considered physically
accessible in their interiors. At MGeo, visitors did not
experience diﬃculty going through the exhibition rooms,
mainly because the museum educators guided them throughout
the visit. Some ramps had been placed over stairs when these
connected rooms, and all visitors used them to move from
one room to another. At CD, as the exhibition is placed in a
large exhibition hall, no steps or walls separated the exhibits.
Visitors did not face barriers getting around or accessing the
exhibitions displayed and all exhibits’ displays had the same
height and shape and were arranged in a spacious way. The
LEV’s visitors did not make speciﬁc comments regarding the
physical accessibility of the place, while EV2 commented: “It’s
good that everything is close by.” EV1, on his turn, commented
on accessibility for a broad spectrum of people who could
beneﬁt: “I liked the height of the cube because a person in a
wheelchair is at a good height.” EV3 added that the height was
appropriate “for those who have dwarﬁsm, too.”
In relation to the second attribute, the design of objects
and exhibitions were considered partially accessible in both
museums, with both groups of visitors emphasizing their
positive experiences. In MGeo, for example, the ﬁrst exhibition
hall displayed a giant globe of the Earth at the beginning of its
formation. The museum educator asked both groups to touch
and explore the piece before giving information about the object
and what it represented. The strategy of touching the globe was
a potent activity because visitors were able to raise hypotheses
and try to interpret and extract information from the object—
skills relevant to science learning and museum visitation. EV1
said, “It’s a globe... it looks like the Moon, maybe a meteor. Very
big.” EV3 said: “This is Planet Earth.” LEV1 asked, “Are these
holes volcanoes? [...] It’s a meteor? Its craters are here, right?.”
From the thoughts and what was raised by the visitors during the
tactile exploration, the museum educator was able to develop a
dialogue about the object, bringing up scientiﬁc information and
relating it to daily life and previous experiences narrated by the
people with visual disabilities.
In CD, most exhibitions are considered hands-on, such as
the Van Der Graaﬀgenerator, association of pulleys, bed of
nails, and Newton’s pendulum. Other exhibitions, such as the
human battery, power-generating bicycle, and power-generating
crankare visual-based and require accessibility strategies to
provide an understanding of their scientiﬁc concepts for people
with visual disabilities.
One vision-centered exhibit (about optical concepts) gives
the option of being entirely dismantled and touched. The
equipment was designed to be disassembled, allowing visitors to
explore its structure and the materials as part of the experiment.
This allowed visitors to understand the information, to make
assumptions based on prior knowledge and to combine these
with the guidance of the museum educator. EV3 commented: “I
should have seen this in my optics classes.” EV2 said, “I think
there are two mirrors, so it doesn’t get inverted. If it were a
mirror, it would be inverted.” EV3 responded, “Yes, it is inverted
and slightly bigger.” EV3 said, “The tail is facing my direction,
leaving the focus and going to the center of curvature to the left
and the right there is a snout.” EV1 ultimately said, “Very nice,
this experience. That’s really cool.”
Another display in the science center also made visitors
from both groups curious and excited: the Van Der Graaﬀ
generator. The exhibit allowed the entire structure to be
touched, which helped them understand how it works. Visitors
could hear and feel the eﬀects of the concept of electriﬁcation
by friction. Educators explained how the generator works,
exploring the characteristic sounds. Both groups commented
about their emotions and everyday experiences—elements that
favor learning. EV1 asked, “Is there light? What color is it? Is
her hair standing up?.” EV3, touching her hair, said, “It’s ﬂying!.”
LEV1, touching the metal part of the stick, said “Wood doesn’t

give shocks. It’s shocking here, right? [...] It’s because it is making
friction.”
Attitudinal accessibility
The Attitudinal accessibility indicator was the most existent
in the two groups of visitors, in special the “inclusive practices,
reception and reception” attribute—demonstrating that the
educators’ guidance and practice during the visits acted as
an essential strategy for accessibility and for reducing of
some barriers encountered. Some attitudes and actions to
welcome people with disabilities were noticed by visitors in both
museums but in diﬀerent forms and to diﬀerent extents.
During both visits to the MGeo, the museum educator
described all rooms and their exhibitions, as in the examples:
“This is a very bright room, the walls are painted blue, and in
front of you there is a plot representing the ocean. [...] This rock
[that you are touching] has darker bands and lighter bands”; “In
this room, our highlight is, above us, the reconstruction of the
skeleton of one of the largest amphibians that ever existed in
the world. We cannot touch it, but it looks like an alligator or
crocodile.” We can see that this is a usual practice, since it was
repeated in the visitation of both groups. In addition to being
an alternative to eliminate barriers, this description practice
favored contextualization and encouraged visitors to seek more
information. For instance, one of the EVs asked the educator
about the rock she was touching. EV3: “What is the color?”
Educator: “It’s a black color.”
In the CD, the museum educator, in her opening speech,
made the presentation combined with the practice of self-
description, as in the excerpt: “Educator: Good afternoon! [...]
I’m 1.66 m tall, my hair is black with blonde highlights, wavy,
and it’s tied in a ponytail. I’m wearing a gray t-shirt, wide-
ﬂowered pants, and black sneakers. I’ma white person, full
of tattoos!.” This attitude of self-description for both groups
generated a connection and awareness and created a relationship
of trust with visitors. This made them feel more welcomed
and comfortable with the educator’s guidance, which opened
space for asking about scientiﬁc topics during the visit, as can
be seen in EV2’s words: “I think the issue of receptivity made
a lot of diﬀerence for us to feel comfortable. For example,
I feel comfortable talking and asking questions. Because this
content is also a little intimidating, you feel embarrassed to say
something wrong or ask silly, nonsense questions.”
Regarding the political and organizational aspects of social
inclusion, there was evidence that the museums take actions to
support them, although challenges and struggles also came up.
During the CD visit, one of the EVs asked about the accessibility
team that makes up the museum. He was informed that the
museum had three educators who were ﬂuent in sign language.
According to the museum educator guiding the group, “we
selected a student from the history course who is blind and will
be our great mentor in this adaptation process for you.” This
is an example of how the institution is organizing itself to be
more inclusive and brings up the issue of representation, i.e.,
having people with visual disabilities working in these spaces
is essential for at least three reasons: (a) consultancy, meaning
that this professional can give input from his own experience
when the museum preparing exhibitions and changing spaces
and objects to be more accessible (Monteiro, 2021); (b) political
presence and representativeness, which is historically important
and central in the ﬁght for the rights of people with disabilities
(Shakespeare, 2006); (c) representativeness, for the visitor to feel
included and to recognize that the museum is also his place.
Communicational accessibility
Nowadays, the museum website is one of the most
important means for any museum to communicate with its
audience. Regarding the content and accessibility on the MGeo
website, one of the EVs asks the museum educator about it:
“We don’t have images of the collection; we have photos of the
exhibition halls. The website does not have an audio description
tool.” For both groups, there was no mention of daily activities,
opening hours, or even MGeo’s social media—information that
would be essential if they wanted to return. We emphasize
that people with visual disabilities, especially those engaged and
interested in cultural activities, have access to and consume
internet content, as EV1 highlighted: “In my free time I like to
access the internet, watch series [and] movies.”
The museum educator tells the EVs group the accessibility
days schedule on the CD, but she does not mention the opening
hours or other relevant information. For the LEVs, at the end
of the visit, information about the museum’s operation was
provided. The educator said: “You can bring family members,
our museum is free, it is open from Monday to Friday from 9
am to 12 pm and from 2 pm to 5 pm. Show up, [you] are all our
guests!.” By sharing this information, the interest and curiosity
of the visitors were aroused about other activities available in the
space, as seen in the comments. A visitor asked, “What time is
the telescope open?” and the educator responded, “On Tuesdays,
from 6 pm to 9 pm.”
Regarding
the
communication
accessibility
strategies
presented to the two groups of visitors at MGeo, we can
highlight three diﬀerent moments. The ﬁrst was a mammal
footprint exhibit that oﬀered a label in braille. When this
resource was provided, the visitors explored the exhibits
without depending on the guidance of the museum educator.
EV3 reported: “I love this braille here.” The second moment
was a tactile mini diorama of the exhibition scenario with
captioning. A tactile mini diorama is a valuable tool that, when
explained by the museum educator, can add rich scientiﬁc
information to a scene that would possibly only be verbally
described to visitors. The third was an interactive dashboard

with audio recording. The dashboard provided information
about various objects of daily life (e.g., plastic bottles, lipstick,
cell phone, tire, etc.) which contained petroleum in their
composition. To activate the audio recording, the visitor had to
choose one of the objects and place it in the dashboard’s center.
This auditory resource made the visitors surprised and curious
about the objects, combined with the joy and fun of being able
to interact with the dashboard freely. LEV2 said, “The rest I
already know have petroleum; the lipstick, I didn’t know.” LEV1
said, “That petroleum dashboard, I thought it was entertaining,
you can put [a product in it and] it has information about the
product.”
Barriers
In general, barriers were encountered by both groups in both
museums, but the EVs emphasized them more. Several MGeo
exhibits, which are in glass cases, are not signaled and obstruct
the tactile exploration of specimens. Visitors from both groups
were uncomfortable with the experience because they could not
touch or did not feel safe going through the exhibition circuit.
EV1 commented: “There are many things in a glass dome, which
is very frustrating. A lot of things we can’t touch, they didn’t
present us with any audio description.” EV3 said, “This makes
us very dependent” and “the part I was most uncomfortable with
was the window display.” LEV2 said that it was only possible
“for [a visually disability] person to walk being moved. You can’t
walk alone here if you can’t see, because it doesn’t have a tactile
ﬂoor; there is nothing. The person will directly collide with the
glass because it is not signaled.”
From examples like these, visitors stated their fear of
exploring the exhibition by themselves and the discomfort
caused by being dependent on the museum educators’
guidance—which directly inﬂuenced their learning experience
and feeling of autonomy. Also, at the CD, the hugest barrier
was access to its building: it had elevators and stairs, with very
poor signage. This made physical guidance necessary. EV1 said:
“Here, it is inaccessible. The problem is not the ladder, the
problem is getting to the ladder! [A visually disability person]
is in no condition to come alone.”
Another barrier that negatively inﬂuenced the visit of
the EVs group at MGeo was the museum educator’s self-
introduction to the group. Right after starting his interaction
with the visitors, he stated that he was not going to describe
himself: “I’m not going to describe myself because I don’t like
it. My self-esteem gets a little... I’m a Latin American guy, that’s
all you need to know.” The group felt the educator was insecure
and not prepared to guide people with disabilities—particularly
with visual disabilities—which generated discomfort and caused
a feeling of awkwardness in the museum. The group commented
on this. EV3 said, “[At the] beginning, mainly, I was a little
uncomfortable,” and EV2 said that this “already created a
barrier.”
Another barrier was the material used in the natural history
museum as a resource for representing the dinosaur fossils
exhibited—plastic dinosaur toys. The EVs group realized that
the material presented for touch did not faithfully represent
the dinosaur fossils in the exhibit, which resulted in unfulﬁlled
expectations. EV1 said, “Actually, what they showed us is not
quite a replica. Because from what I understand, what is there
is just the skeleton and what they gave us was not the skeleton.”
EV3 said, “I felt a little frustrated there [...] I also thought it was
going to be fun there, but it was pretty frustrating.” A suggestion
the visitors gave to make the room more attractive to them
would be to provide sounds and present more realistic replicas.
Finally, regarding the few braille labels in MGeo, the EV
group questioned why only a part of the exhibition contained
this accessibility strategy. EV1 said: “I don’t know what the
purpose was because there were several exhibits and only
a few have braille.” In addition to being only present in
a small part of the exhibition, it is relevant to note that
although helpful for some people, this strategy does not
serve all visitors with visual disabilities. Some people are not
literate in braille, as one of the LEVs pointed out: “I still
don’t know. I would like to learn this here.” At CD, this
communicational strategy was not even used, since there were
no braille labels or audio descriptions in the entire exhibit, which
indicated that the science center still needed to develop this
communication tool.
In summary, based on the accessibility indicators, we can
conclude that:
a) Physical accessibility, related to the internal architectural
aspects of the museums, was well developed. However,
there is still room for improvement, mainly related to the
outside environment of the museums and the design of
objects and some exhibitions inside the museums.
b) Attitudinal accessibility was very present, mainly due to
the guidance and work of the museums’ educators. At
diﬀerent times, visitors found objects, rooms, or exhibits
that presented barriers and the museum staﬀcould carry
out attitudinal practices to overcome or minimize them.
c) Communicational accessibility was rare in the museums,
either
due
to
a
lack
of
diversiﬁed
equipment
or
resources to overcome interpersonal, written, and/or
informative
communication
barriers,
internal
and
external communication.
d) Barriers were present in both visits for both groups.
They demonstrated one or more missing elements for
accessibility, either physical, attitudinal, communicational,
or several of them. Several barriers were encountered
by both—which proved to be issues that the institutions
needed to face. Other barriers were encountered only by
one of the groups, given their diverse proﬁle.

Discussion, limitations, and
contributions of the study
In general, after the framework analysis and also the
interviews
with
participants,
we
can
see
that
visitors
demonstrated
curiosity
and
willingness
to
explore
the
exhibitions and that they had positive experiences concerning
accessibility (primarily with regard to the physical and
attitudinal indicators). From the tactile exploration of objects
and interaction with the exhibits, hands-on activities and
educators, they were able to think up hypotheses and connect
them with previous knowledge and experiences, leading to
potential learning and engagement with scientiﬁc content.
In addition, there is evidence that both groups experienced
appreciation, surprise, discovery, leisure, and emotion—all
of which are crucial to free-choice learning in non-formal
education environments (Falk and Dierking, 2002). The visitors
reported their life experiences several times, which was a fruitful
way to establish a bridge between the exhibition and the visitor,
encourage debate, and favor learning in non-formal learning
environments (Coelho et al., 2022).
From the experiences of the two heterogeneous groups
of visitors with visual disabilities, we can see that both
the natural history museum and the science center oﬀer
accessibility strategies that can potentially provide learning and
science communication. Nonetheless, some gaps, barriers, and
vulnerabilities still need to be improved—which is in line with
the results of the accessibility panorama of science museums in
Latin America obtained by Norberto Rocha et al. (2020b). We
hope that the results obtained here will be able to guide and
encourage more accessible practices.
These results were due to the nature of the visits and
the formats adopted by the museums. First, the visits were
fully guided by educators of each museum, which may have
favored the strong presence of attitudinal accessibility, but, at
the same time, do not oﬀer the option of having an autonomous
visit. Second, the elimination of some physical barriers,
improvements in the signage and design of objects would make
visitors with visual disabilities feel safer and more comfortable
when walking through the halls. Third, both museums provided
a tactile exploration of some exhibits and hands-on activities,
favoring learning and interaction; however, other senses, such
as smell or hearing—which could have been helpful for the
participation of these visitors—were barely explored. Fourth,
the museums did not oﬀer diversiﬁed communication resources,
such as texts and audio texts, multimedia, support resources,
etc.; this led to low of communicational accessibility.
From the experiences of the visitors, we noted that, on the
one hand, some changes to extant objects and exhibits in the
two museums and how they worked could make them more
accessible and participatory to adults with disabilities. Although
on the other hand, providing such facilities to make possible
autonomous visits by people with disabilities still seems to be a
distant prospect for these institutions. This represents a critical
barrier to be solved, since independent living is central for
people with disabilities.
Additionally, the heterogeneity of the visual disabilities
of the study participants, their diﬀerent backgrounds, and
their personal stories stood out during the museum visits and
demonstrated that not all accessibility strategies entirely meet
the needs of every person of this audience—as Argyropoulos and
Kanari (2019) anticipated. Some of the accessibility strategies
were considered positive by and for both groups. Conversely,
other strategies were successful only for one group—e.g., the
braille labels for those who were literate in them. Therefore,
exhibitions and activities need to oﬀer wide-ranging accessibility
strategies with options to explore through multisensory stimuli,
as well as complementary and redundant actions, diversifying
the ways to access information, mainly by providing apparatus,
equipment, and media.
It is worth mentioning that considering the exploratory
and qualitative nature of this study, the results cannot be
extrapolated to all the adults with visual disabilities visiting
museums, since the study was focused on two Brazilian
science museums and the sample was neither statistically
representative of blind and low vision population, nor
geographically distributed.
Although there are these limitations, the study still provides
qualitative data that deepens the experiences and the potential
learning of two heterogeneous groups of visitors with visual
disabilities. It can contribute, in practice and theory, to the
ﬁelds of non-formal education, special education, science
communication, museology, visitor studies, and others with
intersections and points of tension that coexist. Based on our
data, results and discussions, museums and their professionals
can be inspired, learn and plan an organizational change toward
inclusion and accessibility.
Science museums are places of non-formal education
and science communication; they can contribute to free-
choice learning throughout the lives of people with visual
disabilities if their accessibility strategies (physical, attitudinal,
and communicational) are continuously improving. It is
thus necessary to keep elaborating strategies, planning and
encouraging social interaction for and with diﬀerent audiences.
Recalling Levent and Reich (2013), museums need to be able to
learn from the visitors because they are the ones who can explain
their needs and what they are looking for in these educational
and cultural experiences. Therefore, our primary expectation
in performing this type of study was to highlight their voices,
perspectives, and opinions, as the protagonists of accessibility
and inclusion in science museums.
