Creating Visitor-Centered Museum
Experiences for Adults With
Developmental Disabilities: A
Collaborative Story
A N T H O N Y W O O D R U F F
Florida State University
Museums have a history of being elitist institutions for educated, upper-class,
White audiences. However, in recent decades, many museums have worked to
overcome this idea by providing visitor-centered approaches to refocus their
efforts and concentrate on the needs and interests of all visitors, rather than the
objects on display. One population of visitors that is often overlooked by
museums is adults with developmental disabilities. This audience serves as the
primary participant group for this qualitative case study, along with their parents
or caregivers and museum staff members. By using disability studies as a
guiding framework, the participants in this study collaborated with the researcher
and museum staff members to document their museum experiences through
inclusive artmaking, interviews, discussions, and observations. The purpose of this
research was to explore how such collaborations might create more inclusive
and visitor-centered museum experiences for adults with developmental
disabilities within a small regional local art center. The findings were used to
make recommendations for future programming and consisted of several themes
developed during the coding process. The themes included understanding,
accessibility, interactive, collaboration, communication, and evaluation.

Introduction
M
useums
are
experiencing
a
global
awakening
pertaining
to their power and practice as
representatives of cultural activities
and their potentiality for contributing
to societal transformation (Rowson-
Love
et
al.,
2021;
Sandell
&
Nightingale,
2012).
In
part,
this
awakening is in response to the needs
of
people
of
all
social,
cultural,
educational, and economic statuses who
have begun to stand up for and exercise
their human rights. Social change is
inevitable,
and
museums
are
under
increasing
examination
and
criticism
as underrepresented or misrepresented
groups are demanding their cultural
identities to be appropriately addressed
within museum settings. Many museums
have embraced these ideas by working
with communities, artists, and academics
to promote inclusive and visitor-centered
change from within the museum (Love &
Boda, 2017; Woodruff, 2018). Although
these shifts to a more visitor-centered
approach
are
a
step
in
a
positive
direction,
museums
historically
have
done a poor job when reaching out to
individuals with disabilities and providing
additional programming in response to
their specific needs (Keene, 2018).
As
stated
by
Hannah
Goodwin,
accessibility manager of the Museum of Fine
Arts in Boston, “Art is for everyone, and the
more diverse the visitors to the museum, the
richer
the
experience,
the
more
possible
points of view, the more possibilities for
connection and discovery” (as cited in Keene,
2018, para. 3). Museums of all types, sizes,
and budgets have the ability to offer visitors
with developmental disabilities programming
that
could
benefit
their
overall
museum
experience
and
become
more
inclusive
simultaneously; however, little research or
literature exists documenting the museum
experiences of adults with developmental
disabilities, with a similar absence of ethical
research resources in the larger related field
of
art
education
and
research
academia
(Wexler et al., 2022).
The intention of this research study was to
foster a collaborative learning environment at a
small regional museum between myself, as the
researcher, and the participants with differing
developmental
disabilities.
The
equal
acceptance
of
the
contributions
of
all
participants allowed the research to change or
transform during the research process. The
added voices from participants was beneficial,
as
visitors
with
disabilities
can
have
an
authentic impact in creating a more inclusive
museum experience (Fox & Macpherson, 2015).
The inclusion of participants’ voices and their
active participation added a layer of quality and
authenticity, as “the more different voices are
honored within our qualitative community, the
stronger and more interesting that community
will be” (Richardson & St. Pierre, 2005, p. 959).
As a way to honor the voices of the
participants in this project, and to treat them
equitably as team members, I refer to them
most frequently as artists in an attempt to
avoid
using
labels
or
imply
that
these
individuals are lacking in some way. The
wording
“participant
with
developmental
disability”
or
“artist
with
developmental
disability”
was
unneeded
for
staying
consistent with the goals of disability studies
and
the
purpose
of this
research. Other
Woodruff / Creating Visitor-Centered Museum Experiences

participants in the study included parental
family members or caregivers of the artists, as
well as museum staff members, who are
commonly referred to as collaborators. My
intention was to focus on the strengths of
each individual and modify the environment
to remove barriers and increase successful
experiences (Mertens & McLaughlin, 2004),
rather
than
seeking
change
within
the
individual.
Further, within the context of the current
work being done in museums, there has been
an ever-increasing push to reconnect with
forgotten communities while still being a
source of engaging recreational experiences
for
returning
visitors
(Simon,
2016).
The
American Alliance of Museums’s (Center for
the Future of Museums, 2017) TrendsWatch
demonstrated the crucial need for museums
to
become
more
accessible
to
diverse
audiences while taking meaningful actions in
the community. Partnerships formed with the
community and marginalized populations can
ultimately
lead
to
new
learning,
deeper
understandings, and interpersonal connections
that may not have existed before (Mertens,
2009). Current trends in museum education
also emphasize the implementation of new
practices focused on lived experiences, personal
connections,
hands-on
activities
(Samis
&
Michaelson, 2017; Villeneuve & Love, 2017; Yoo,
2023),
and
educational
programming
to
address
the
salient
needs
of
the
local
community in response to social inequality by
working as partners in curation (Kletchka &
Casto, 2021; Rowson-Love et al., 2021).
All of these improvements are in response
to museums’ increased desire of being for
someone
(the
visitor)
and
less
about
something
(the
object;
Weil,
1999),
as
museums move into a progressively visitor-
centered mindset. In relation, Feldman (2017)
stated:
The most significant change in the
museum field over the last twenty years
is the shift from museum work focused
on our peers, colleagues, and ourselves
to work focused on our audiences.
Museums have spent the last fifty years
building collections, donors, staffs, and
buildings—but to what end? Our work
is meaningless unless it is seen, experi-
enced, and digested. (p. x)
Visitor-centered approaches are helping
museums become more inclusive with their
audiences, but little has been done in the
majority of museums across the country to
improve
the
experiences
of
visitors
with
developmental
disabilities
(Stringer,
2014).
The subject of disability itself is a complex,
multifaceted one that has often been used to
express an insufficiency within the individual
that—presumptuously—needs
to
be
fixed.
This mindset has created a situation where
museums and other institutions feel they
need to set parameters that modify the
behaviors of persons with disabilities to meet
the museum’s expectations (Padner, 2018),
rather than asking the museum to make
accommodations on behalf of its visitors with
special
needs.
In
response,
this
research
utilized
a
disability
studies
framework
to
document
the
museum
and
artmaking
experiences of the artists and participants
involved. The purpose of this research was
to explore how such collaborations might
create more inclusive and visitor-centered
museum experiences for these visitors in
the
future. Findings were
used to
make
recommendations for future programming at
smaller regional museums and consisted of
several themes: understanding, accessibility,
interactive, collaboration, communication, and
evaluation.
Literature Review
The notion that museums need to connect
their exhibits to visitors with disabilities is not
a new concept, but it is an unfinished one.
Studies in Art Education / Volume 64, No. 3
361

Sharpe (1981) described how the Smithsonian
American History Museum in Washington, DC,
created a training program for its docents by
sending them on a scavenger hunt through
the museum while either blindfolded or in
wheelchairs
to
simulate
disabilities.
The
findings showed that door frames were not
wide
enough,
it
was
difficult
to
roll
a
wheelchair across carpet, and there was a
general lack of interactives for visitors with
vision difficulties (Sharpe, 1981). Many of
these obstacles have since been resolved with
universal design initiatives and compliance
with Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA)
guidelines (ADA.gov, 1990); however, there
was more work left unfinished.
Chimirri-Russell (2010) noted that many
museums
have
limited
awareness
of
the
needs of individuals
with disabilities
and
have narrowed themselves to facilitating the
ease of access to the museum building. These
strategies focus on remaining ADA compliant
through the installation of automatic doors,
more accessible restroom facilities, and other
basic comforts for those in wheelchairs and
with other mobility issues. Nevertheless, there
are insufficient or no programs in place
designed specifically for the unique needs of
visitors with developmental disabilities. Many
larger museums offer visitor accommodations,
such as listening devices, large print and braille
information, sign language interpretation, and
wheelchairs (McGinnis, 2007). However, very
few museums offer tools for visitors with
developmental
disabilities,
such
as
autism
spectrum disorder (Woodruff, 2019). While the
services listed above are an important part of
creating
positive
museum
experiences
for
visitors with physical disabilities, they tend to
focus on remaining ADA compliant and not
fostering a meaningful museum experience.
Many accommodations offered to visitors with
disabilities merely scratch the surface of the
services museums could provide to become
more
inclusive
and
visitor
centered.
True
inclusion within museums is not just about
making
the
exhibitions
accessible
to
individuals
with
disabilities,
but
also
for
making the exhibit reflective of all audiences
and facilitating the experience of all parties
involved.
Generally speaking, there has been an
effort to alter the missions of museums in
their efforts to become more inclusive and
accommodating to new types of visitors.
Nonetheless,
there
is
currently
a
gap
in
research focusing directly on the museum
experiences of visitors with developmental
disorders, and an even greater void in research
focusing
on
adults
with
developmental
disabilities. Many adults with developmental
disabilities
are
often
forgotten
members
of
their
own
communities,
with
minimal
recreational opportunities available to them
(Macpherson et al., 2016), and there is little
research to refute this claim.
While the majority of children diagnosed
with
developmental
disabilities
receive
additional
support
within
their
K–12
educational settings, their support systems
can differ greatly as they transition into
adulthood. These transitions most often occur
around the age of 21, when students with
disabilities
can
no
longer
receive
public
school services and assistance outlined by
their individual education plans. Many parents
of
young
adults
with
developmental
disabilities who have aged out of public
school systems have described this transition
as jumping off a cliff into a world with very
few support systems (Hughes, 2018).
Even
before
reaching
adulthood,
individuals
with
developmental
disabilities
often have low educational expectations, as
perceived by society. In addition, they are
more likely to drop out of school and often
receive
insufficient
support
in
more
advanced educational and vocational options
(Roulstone, 2012). Macpherson et al. (2016)
speculated
that
adult
individuals
with
developmental
disabilities
may
often
Woodruff / Creating Visitor-Centered Museum Experiences
362

represent the most undervalued or forgotten
members
of
their
communities.
These
individuals are also more likely to live in
poverty, be taken advantage of, and have
little
access
to
recreational
or
vocational
activities.
Even with their conditions and diagnosis,
individuals with developmental disabilities are
unique, with their own personal likes and
dislikes,
strengths
and
weaknesses,
and
successes and struggles. Many of these people
have even become successful collaborators,
researchers, and artists (Fox & Macpherson,
2015; Mertens, 2009; Wexler & Derby, 2020).
Because
of
their
abilities
and
firsthand
knowledge,
individuals
with
developmental
disabilities
should
have
opportunities
to
participate in research like this to address the
dislikes, weaknesses, and struggles they face
when visiting a museum (Kallio-Tavin, 2020), all
while
helping
construct
significant
change
within the museum itself.
Methodology
To
create
accessible
and
engaging
museum programming to benefit the artists
and participants of this research project, I
adopted the frameworks of the transformative
paradigm,
disability
studies,
and
Inclusive
Arts.
According
to
Mertens,
an
extensive
contributor
writing
on
the
transformative
paradigm, this blended approach seeks to be
inclusive
of
issues
for
all
marginalized
communities—including
individuals
with
disabilities—where
stakeholders
become
collaborators
in
the
research
process
(personal
communication,
May
15,
2018).
Mertens (2009) defined the transformative
paradigm as a research approach focused on
culturally appropriate strategies that facilitate
new
understandings
with
marginalized
communities
in
ways
that
support
social
change while examining classical issues of
unequal power.
While
the
transformative
paradigm
benefited
this
study,
the
framework
of
disability studies was more influential as a
central
scholarly
approach.
Wexler
(2012)
defined disability studies as research “initiated
by people inside the label with discursive and
narratological accounts of being disabled” (p.
72). Snyder (2002) described disability studies
as a culture of activist–scholars who examine
a category of individual diversity—such as
disability—similar to race, gender, or sexual
orientation. Disability studies do not support
methods that require an individual with a
disability to change to meet the demands on
their environment; instead, changes to the
environment itself are needed (Berger, 2013).
Disability studies often empower individuals
with
disabilities
to
become
collaborative
research partners by adding their voice to
research
outcomes,
dismissing
historical
ignorance,
and
potentially
changing
the
environment for future generations (Allen,
2019; Berger, 2013; Derby, 2016; Wilson &
Lewiecki-Wilson, 2002).
Overall, within both disability studies and
the transformative paradigm, it is important to
include individuals with disabilities directly into
the research design as research partners. No
matter how disability studies are incorporated
into research, Kallio-Tavin (2019) stated,
it is important to realize that the disabil-
ity studies approach does not provide a
practical tool kit for [educators] but
rather offers a possibility for a deep
understanding of the lives of disabled
people and a worldview beyond ableist
and normative thinking. (para. 2)
Closely related, another tool used by this
research was Inclusive Arts, which represents
a
specific
artmaking
program
that
offers
creative
collaboration
between
disabled
and
non-disabled
individuals
to
support
the
acquisition
of
knowledge,
skills,
and
competence
(Fox
&
Macpherson,
2015).
Inclusive artmaking gave the artists a chance
Studies in Art Education / Volume 64, No. 3
363

to discuss the museum visit while we created
art together.
According to Fox (2014), Inclusive Arts and
the inclusion of individuals with disabilities
within a museum experience can provide a
number of benefits to both the museum and
its newly gained audience by including the
following: (1) high-quality learning experiences
that begin with the interest of the group; (2)
vibrant resources for inspiration and creative
experiments; (3) enhanced opportunities for
reflection, practical experiences, and active
involvement; (4) opportunities to make art in
new
ways
within
the
gallery
space;
(5)
opportunities
to
challenge
perceptions
of
marginalized people and the values placed on
them and their creativity; (6) opportunities to
develop new ways of working with collections
that are beneficial and transferable; and (7)
educational benefits. In addition, Yoo (2023)
indicated that artmaking in a museum setting
could provide adults with opportunities to
push beyond accustomed lecture-based tours.
All of these benefits point toward museums
becoming
more
inclusive
by
encouraging
creativity and artmaking for individuals with
disabilities as a way to reflect back on their
museum experiences.
Study Overview
The overarching question providing the
focus for this inquiry was: How can a museum
create inclusive and visitor-centered programs
for adults with developmental disabilities? To
unpack the study further, follow-up research
questions included:
1. How might the museum experiences
involving individuals with developmental
disabilities (artists) and other collaborators
(parents, caregivers, and museum staff
members) lead to a more inclusive and
visitor-centered museum experience for
all visitors?
2. How could the participation, dialogue,
and communication involved in this
project impact the museum experience
and the artists’ desire to return to the
museum?
3. What evidence, if any, of the museum
visit can be seen in the artmaking experi-
ence and resulting conversations?
This research investigation used a case study
design often used when data collection requires
flexibility as researchers pull many different data
sets together (Hesse-Biber & Leavy, 2008). The
data sets involved in this research included
interviews
with
caregivers
or
parents
and
museum staff members, discussions with artists,
observational field notes taken during museum
experiences, and the content analysis of works
of art created. A convenience sample of artists
was
taken
from
personal
contacts
and
connections made during the time of working
with adults with developmental disabilities in
Paducah, Kentucky (Etikan et al., 2016). I have
worked with each of the artists before and
established positive working relationships with
each of them.
These artists were chosen to participate
based on their availability to take multiple visits
to the Yeiser Art Center (YAC) located in
Paducah, Kentucky, where they engaged in
museum research workshops (MRWs). The YAC
is a local art center that hosts juried art shows
and
single-artist
exhibitions
and
displays
rotating
exhibitions
of
their
permanent
collection. The YAC is similar to several small-
town local galleries, but they also enjoy the
benefits of a permanent exhibition space, a
permanent collection, and full-time and part-
time
staff
members
who
support
the
community’s awareness of art in every way they
can. Each MRW consisted of a docent-led tour,
observations, and discussions with museum
staff, and concluded in an artmaking session
and artist discussions. MRWs were recorded
with multiple audiovisual technologies to be
reviewed and transcribed during the analysis
Woodruff / Creating Visitor-Centered Museum Experiences
364

phase. Interviews were conducted before and
after the series of workshops with museum staff
members and caregivers or parents to capture
any changes during the course of the study.
Findings
When
closely
examining
the
first
supporting research question, each of the
MRWs provided thought-provoking insights. A
positive discovery included that each of the
artists had their own ideas to make museums
more inclusive and visitor centered for visitors
with developmental disabilities. The artists
desired museums to be more mindful of
sensory sensitivities within their exhibitions,
with noise being a big concern among the
artists. One of the artists mentioned how he
went to a car museum and did not like the
loud noises related to a display of car horns,
but he does usually enjoy interactive and
hands-on activities sometimes included at
museums. Similar to the works on display in
the
exhibition,
the
artists
also
preferred
museums
with
hands-on
interactives
and
things
to
participate
in
while
visiting
museums
and
galleries.
Parents
and
caregivers also preferred taking the artists to
museums with interactives, as the overall
enjoyment and potential learning experiences
were a primary concern of theirs.
While hands-on interactives are important,
understanding
the
sensory
needs
of
individuals
with
disabilities
was
also
a
recurring concern with artists, parents, and
caregivers. Museum staff suggested special
visiting hours to accommodate visitors with
sensory
regulation
needs.
In
addition
to
sensory
sensitivities,
being
mindful
and
understanding of visitors with mobility issues
was another concern for artists. The group
desired places to sit or relax that are easily
accessible
between
stairs,
escalators,
and
elevators when moving about the museum.
Mobility
issues
come
in
many
forms
for
visitors with disabilities, as they may use
different types of wheelchairs, walkers, and
canes. Discussions between the docent and
artists also determined that areas of rest
would still allow visitors to be a part of the art
experience
by
positioning
benches
where
people could still enjoy the art on display.
When examining the second supporting
research question, there were several more
prominent findings that emerged from the
collected data. The participation, dialogue,
and communication during the workshops
created a positive environment for all the
artists, as they seemingly felt comfortable
with me, the museum staff member, the
exhibiting artist, and the other artists. Because
these artists were already comfortable with
each other and myself, during the first MRW I
noticed
the
communication
was
relaxed,
informal,
and
often
unrelated
to
the
workshops themselves. It felt as though I was
with a group of friends at times as we worked
collaboratively
on
artmaking.
When
not
talking about the YAC or the MRW, the artists
freely talked about their own interests and
other happenings in their day-to-day lives. I
learned about upcoming family vacations,
one artist’s interest in cars, Disney movie
characters, and baseball. Each of the artists
expressed
a
desire
to
return
and
had
indicated how they enjoyed their time in the
workshops because they knew what was
expected and with whom they would be
working.
During the second MRW, two artists chose
to participate together as they read and
interacted with all of the ceramic vases on
display.
Not
only
did
they
participate
collaboratively while in the YAC, they also
talked the most with each other about things
in which they were interested. Another artist
spent much of her time within the gallery
taking pictures of art, while the fourth artist
clearly wanted to move on to the artmaking
phase
as
he
was
uninterested
in
fully
participating
in
the
gallery
tour
and
accompanying discussions. It should be noted
Studies in Art Education / Volume 64, No. 3
365

that while the artists did participate in the
research, all had differing attention spans and
participated in the MRWs in their own unique
ways. While their individual disabilities may
have contributed to their attention spans,
their
behavior
during
the
MRWs
seemed
genuine
and
authentic,
based
on
my
experience having previously worked with
these
artists
before
and
knowing
their
personalities, interests, and needs. Overall, the
participation, dialogue, and communication
during
the
workshops
created
a
positive
atmosphere
for
all
of
the
artists,
and
friendships began to form and restrengthen
throughout
the
project.
Several
artists
enjoyed being around each other again as the
COVID-19 pandemic had changed their daily
schedules, and this research took place just as
things were beginning to return to normal.
When looking at the third supporting
research question, an art content analysis
(Knowles
&
Cole,
2008;
Nodelman,
1988;
Sullivan,
2010),
along
with
symbolic
constructivist conversations (Barry, 1996) with
the artists, were used to closely examine the
art created. The strategies for analyzing visual
images were heavily influenced by Knowles
and
Cole
(2008),
Nodelman
(1988),
and
Sullivan (2010), as the art was examined to
determine how images were used to express
a narrative experience while also showcasing
aspects
of
the
museum
experience.
The
art content analysis also looked at choices
of
artistic
style,
communicative
features,
principles
of
design,
elements
of
art,
and
the
positioning
of
objects,
which
supports
enhanced
meaning-making
and
understanding. Not only did I conduct a
content analysis of the participants’ art to
examine the artistic choices made by the
artists, but perhaps more importantly, the
works were also evaluated through symbolic
constructivist conversations (Barry, 1996) with
the artists themselves as they explained their
art
and
its
relevance
to
their
museum
experience. Blending art content analysis with
symbolic constructivist conversations fit nicely
with my use of disability studies research
goals because the artists examined the art
they created themselves, rather than just
having it dissected through an “expert’s”
critical viewpoint.
During the course of the workshops, it
became clear that only one artist created art
related to the YAC and what he saw on
display. This artist painted the YAC’s mascot, a
red yak, which is used in the museum’s
marketing materials and portrayed as a large
statue outside the gallery close to where we
were set up for artmaking (Figure 1). Two of
the artists attended the MRWs with their own
ideas of something they wanted to create
based on videos watched on YouTube and
pictures of their previously made paintings.
Each of them enthusiastically showed me
pictures or YouTube clips of their painting
ideas before even entering the gallery as we
waited outside for everyone to arrive to the
first session. Through my content analysis, I
thought the geometric shapes in an artist’s
painting were related to the large sculptures
within an exhibition that was primarily built
from similar large geometric shapes, but the
artist told the group they were completely
unrelated to the exhibition, and he titled his
painting Bubbles (Figure 2).
Even if the museum experience did not
directly affect all of the artists’ painting choices,
artmaking did positively impact the overall
experience in the MRWs. One artist described
how she liked to experiment in her painting
process by trying out new artistic techniques
she saw on various types of social media.
During the MRWs, she tried a pour-painting
technique to create a planet-like sphere (Figure
3) and then created a navy-blue galaxy scene
behind
her
circular-shaped
planet.
She
connected
her
painting
to
a
space-and-
technology-themed museum and titled it Deep
in Space (Figure 4). Another artist shared a
memory from a river-themed museum and a
boat-driving
simulator,
but
he
stated
his
Woodruff / Creating Visitor-Centered Museum Experiences
366

painting was not related to either museum
(Figure 5). The artist who did paint something
related to the YAC reaffirmed his painting was a
yak or “red buffalo,” and his inspiration came
from the yak sculpture used by the YAC (Figure
6). Without the artists’ input and symbolic
conversations (Barry, 1996), I could have easily
misinterpreted
the
data
or
overextended
connections that were not actually there. On
the other hand, some of the artists were not
able to fully verbalize their artistic decisions
when asked about potential deeper connections
to the exhibition within their artwork. However,
the addition of content analysis (Knowles &
Cole, 2008; Nodelman, 1988; Sullivan, 2010) and
symbolic
constructivist
conversations
(Barry,
1996) proved beneficial to this research, and I
suggest other researchers include them to
assimilate authentic and genuine data that
include multiple perspectives when including
artmaking into research.
During the artmaking portions of the
MRWs, I assisted artists as much as possible
without intruding on their voice or individual
artistic
style.
While
inclusive
artmaking
practices
often
involve
a
collaboration
and blending of ideas between researchers
and artists (Fox & Macpherson, 2015), I felt
it
was
important
that
finished
artworks
be
unaffected
by
any
of
my
inherent
goals for the study. This strategy is largely
congruent
with
the
goals
of
most

approaches to disability studies and the
central
tenets
of
the
transformative
paradigm,
in
regard
to
the
constant
examination
of
power
relationships
and
ownership
throughout
every
stage
of
research
investigation
(Mertens,
2009;
Wexler, 2011). Even though only one artist
created art directly related to the museum
itself, the artmaking portion of the workshop
was a fruitful addition to the research study
and enjoyable among all the participating
artists, as it provided a relaxed opportunity
for discussion among them. Artmaking was
also
appreciated
by
the
parents
or
caregivers, who were presented with the
finished paintings during the second round
of interview sessions.
Findings related directly to the primary
research question were broken down into
coded
themes
developed
throughout
the
research
process
during
the
analysis
of
multiple data sets with contributions from the
artists and other participants. These themes
were confirmed by artists during member-
checking sessions, which occurred at the
beginning
of
the
MRWs,
and
interview
sessions.
The
themes
consisted
of
the
following terms: understanding, accessibility,
interactive, collaboration, communication, and
evaluation (Figure 7). The coded themes are
represented as recommendations provided to
museums looking to create visitor-centered
programs for individuals with developmental
disabilities in the future.

Discussion and Suggestions
Understanding
When developing understanding, Couser
(2002) noted how past research on individuals
often included narratives and findings largely
determined by the views of non-disabled
people, which may not accurately represent
the
viewpoints
of
the
population
under
investigation. This makes it important to build
positive relationships and accurately access
the voices of individuals with disabilities for
more inclusive exhibitions or programming
planning. Without the input of the artists and
their families, I may not have fully understood
the importance of planning age-appropriate
visitor-centered
programming
that
is
also
interesting for visitors. Parents and caregivers
were concerned that many existing programs
they had experienced in the past were too
childish or did not fully meet the needs of
their now adult artists.
During the course of this research study,
one
museum
staff
member
developed
a
deeper understanding of the artists involved
Figure 5. An artist’s painting after the third MRW.
Woodruff / Creating Visitor-Centered Museum Experiences

and expressed, “I got to know them [the
artists] and was able to relate to them a
little bit more, so each time was easier.”
The more you work with individuals with
developmental disabilities, the more your levels
of acceptance, comfort, and understanding
grow. I recommend that museums look to
provide programming for adult visitors with
disabilities by reaching out
to community
organizations that specialize in this work to

discuss
potential
areas
of
opportunity
or
improvement.
Accessibility
When working to create programming for
adults
with
developmental
disabilities,
I
strongly recommend that galleries, as well as
the museum itself, are able to accommodate
the basic needs of these visitors. To meet
accessibility requests, this research detailed
the
artists’
and
caregivers’
concerns
on
providing
special
visiting
hours,
adequate
space to move within galleries, handicap-
accessible restrooms, and comfortable places
to
rest.
While
the
majority
of
large
organizations
and
museums
accomplished
this task long ago with universal design
initiatives (Connell et al., 1997), there are still
areas
of
concern
for
smaller,
local,
and
regional-sized museums, as many artists and
caregivers
shared
negative
experiences
related to mobility and exhibition design.
Both artists and their families expressed a
need for museums to be more mindful of
visitors with mobility issues by gaining a
better understanding of how an exhibition is
experienced
by
visitors
requiring
assistive
mobility
devices,
such
as
wheelchairs
or
walkers.
Another accessibility recommendation for
museums
is
to
potentially
offer
private
visiting hours that are specific to individuals
with developmental disabilities. One caregiver
expressed how helpful these hours could be
so their artist could “take the time to look and
enjoy—be
themselves—where
they
don’t
have
to
worry
about
what
people
are
thinking, or if someone is laughing or staring
at them.” The YAC’s director also had ideas
for scheduling specific times for people with
disabilities, as well as creating sensory-friendly
hours for visitors on the autism spectrum, “so
that they could interact with whatever they
need to in the exhibition.” When working to

create
programming
for
adults
with
developmental
disabilities,
I
strongly
recommend museum administrators ensure
galleries, as well as the museum itself, can
accommodate the basic needs of all visitors
to
become
both
accessible
and
visitor
centered.
Interactive
Another recommendation that was heavily
suggested by the artists and participants in
this study was the inclusion of interactives
within museums and galleries. Each artist
mentioned how much they enjoyed touching
and spinning the works within an exhibition
(Figure
8),
while
parents
and
caregivers
expressed
a
desire
for
more
hands-on
activities that could engage their artist in the
exhibition and further enhance their learning.
The
museum
staff
also
enjoyed
the
interactives
within
the
exhibition,
but
expressed how difficult it was to provide
them in every exhibition due to their limited
staff and funding.
One great potential hands-on activity for
art museums is offering a way for visitors to
create art (Fox & Macpherson, 2015; Woodruff,
2019). Even though only one artist created art
that was directly related to the YAC during
this research, the artmaking did foster a
desire to return to the gallery, which seemed
to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the
MRW. One of the artist’s parents also offered
the idea of museums receiving input from
people
with
disabilities
when
providing
interactives:
“If
the
disability
or
disabled
person has low vision, then they’re going to
need something that they can touch. … [I]f
hearing loss is the disability, they’re going to
need different ways to learn about the object
on display.” It became clear that, by providing
interactives,
museums
could
encourage
learning, discussion, and deeper connections
to the work on display.
Collaboration
As we collaborated together, compassion
was necessary when attempting to break
down individual artist and participant needs
or ideas with more depth. This aided in a
deeper understanding of how each artist was
both an individual with special needs as well
as a research partner throughout the course
of the study. Without an added layer of
compassion and understanding for individuals
with developmental disabilities, as well as
each
artist
and
their
families,
vibrant
collaborations cannot occur.
In addition, museum staffing is another key
component
of
the
collaboration
process;
however,
staffing
also
became a
research
setback in this study as several museum staff
members did not fully participate as originally
planned. While this setback can be attributed
to the small size of the YAC and its established
work schedules, I encourage museums with
limited resources to—at the very least—meet
underrepresented
populations
halfway
by
providing
inclusive
programming
without
placing
the
responsibility
of
seeking
appropriate accommodations and educational
opportunities entirely on the persons with
disabilities or their caregivers.
It was perhaps the YAC’s small size in
conjunction with the staff’s novice understanding
of visitor-centered programming that contributed
to less collaboration; however, larger institutions
may also feel the same constraints when it
comes to equipping staff with a more visitor-
centered mindset. In regard to collaboration, one
artist’s parent expressed how museum staff
should reach out to disability organizations or
special needs community centers to exchange
ideas and gain a better understanding of the
needs of certain groups. “I think one important
thing is to be proactive, rather than reactive. You
know, not wait till they show up and then figure
something out, but instead, purposely create
something to bring that particular community
into the museum.” Without collaboration and
Studies in Art Education / Volume 64, No. 3
373

input
from
stakeholders,
programming
for
individuals with disabilities will be lacking.
Communication
Another
recommendation
for
museums
looking to provide programs for individuals
with
disabilities
is
the
importance
of
communication. Communication is needed not
only to foster many of the previous themes,
but it also became significant during the third
MRW, where supported interpretation (SI) and
the friendships among artists shined. During
the third workshop, an exhibiting artist joined
us as a guest docent and offered new insights
into
the
exhibition
and
the
artworks
he
created. He believed the multiple forms of
communication embedded in the exhibition
design were an opportunity for visitors to
interact with the objects on display. The
exhibiting
artist
pointed
out
that
not
all
museums and galleries could create the same
experience that he had by emphasizing, “We
can
present
an
exhibit
that
offers
many
different ways to approach the same story.”
His explanation immediately reminded me of
SI that states how the museum can provide
opportunities
for
visitors
to
interact
with
exhibitions, leave their thoughts and opinions,
and
participate
with
an
exhibition
and
museum in new ways, all of which are focused
around the visitor (Villeneuve, 2013).
SI has been included successfully in a
number of exhibitions (Viera et al., 2017; Viera
& Villeneuve, 2021; Villeneuve & Viera, 2014),
not only for the added level of interactives
provided to
visitors,
but
also
because
it
advocates
for
departments,
teams,
and
museum staff members working together and
increasing communication and understanding
among the staff. Viera et al. (2020) noted that
a crucial part of SI was the needed dialogue
between curators, museum educators, staff
from
other
departments,
and
community
members
as
new
exhibitions
are
being
planned. Together, this expanded team can
work through the exhibition development,
planning, execution, and evaluation phases,
all while focusing their efforts on the visitor.
Another aspect of communication that is
important to this research was the friendships
formed
between
the
artists
during
the
workshops. Even though all of the artists
knew
each
other
previously
from
their
participation
in
a
local
special
needs
community center, through the workshops I
experienced the bonds and friendships shared
among artists as we all talked together. In
particular,
the
informal
conversations
between two artists really stood out during
each
MRW
as
these
artists
sang
songs
together, greeted people walking by, and
pointed out the different kinds of cars driving
by as they talked and made art.
Evaluation
As museums begin working with visitors in
new ways, it is important to accurately record
their input into the exhibitions, and member
checking
proved
useful
for
this
research.
Member checking is defined as a quality
control process by which a researcher seeks
to improve the accuracy and credibility of
what has been recorded through participant
verification and feedback (Harper & Cole,
2012), which is primarily used in qualitative
inquiry methodology. Member checking was
incorporated into this research not only to
increase transparency and authenticity, but
also to illustrate how this study took place
with artists and not on participants, thus
allowing them to have an increased voice
while following the goals of disability studies
research.
This added evaluation also embraced the
disability studies framework, which advocates
for individuals with disabilities to be included
as
decision
makers
within
the
research
(Wexler, 2011). Evaluation with the artists also
allowed this research to be shaped by the
transformative paradigm (Mertens, 2009) and
inclusive
artmaking
experiences
(Fox
&
Macpherson, 2015) where the artists could
Woodruff / Creating Visitor-Centered Museum Experiences
374

have guided the course of research as we
made
art
and
worked
together.
Almost
exclusively, the artists did not change the
direction of this intended research; in fact,
they seemed more interested in starting the
MRW themselves and less in the member-
checking sessions. During member-checking
sessions, I reviewed my field notes journal
with the artists and told them of possible
themes I developed in the coding process
from reviewing multiple data sources. The
artists were quick to verify my data and
accept the codes with little input, possibly
indicating that they did not fully comprehend
the intent of the member-checking process or
perhaps their own eagerness to simply begin
the workshop and tour the YAC. However,
when I suggested combining themes and
categories that were closely related, the artists
were confident in the themes chosen during
coding and preferred they remain unchanged.
Implications for Museum Education
The visitor-centered museum is a concept
in museology where museums must refocus
their strategic mission around their audience
and potential future audiences. It is a process
that
demands
a
more
personal
visitor
experience
and
is
most
often
tasked
to
museum educators. Visitor-centered practices
call for the inclusion of lived experiences,
personal connections, and hands-on activities
in exhibition spaces as way to transition away
from exclusionary practices of past exhibition
strategies
(Villeneuve,
2013;
Villeneuve
&
Love, 2017) and move toward creating spaces
where people naturally gather to learn and
discover in their own unique ways. The 1990s
set
the
course
for
museum
education
departments on refocusing their efforts with
the
publication
of
Excellence
and
Equity:
Education
and
the
Public
Dimension
of
Museums
(Hirzy,
1992),
the
museum
experience model (Falk & Dierking, 2016),
individual and unique constructivist learning
concepts (Hooper-Greenhill, 1995), and the
awareness that museums must become about
someone (the visitor) instead of something
(the object; Weil, 1999).
Museum educators can accomplish this,
all while retaining their relevance to society,
by
continually
improving
and
becoming
receptive to new ideas in the field. This
research reestablishes those initial concepts
by focusing on the smaller local and regional
museums scattered across the country that
have been slow to change. Larger institutions,
such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York, or the Art Institute in Chicago,
have been able to respond to the need for
visitor-centered concepts more easily due to
their
expansive
budgets
and
staffing.
However, this research, along with similar
research (Woodruff, 2019), points out the
struggles of smaller and regional museums
that have yet to fully embrace these ideas, or
even have the ability to be inclusive toward
all audiences. One audience that is often
marginalized and forgotten are individuals
with developmental disabilities, particularly
adults with developmental disabilities.
Even
though
these
adults
are
often
overlooked in society, the research showed
that
this
particular
group
of
artists
had
numerous past experiences with all types of
museums
of
differing
sizes,
budgets,
or
artifacts on display. These artists have visited
zoos, aquariums, history museums, science
centers,
art
galleries,
local
museums,
car
museums, sports museums, and museums
related to American products. They have also
visited
museums
and
galleries
with
their
families, taken trips with their community
centers and schools, and were able to recall
countless experiences of how museums could
better meet their needs. Reaching out to
adults with disabilities by creating visitor-
centered
programs
is
an
incentive
for
museums
in
developing
new
audience
groups, as this group makes up a large
segment
of
the
population
(Centers
for
Studies in Art Education / Volume 64, No. 3
375

Disease Control, 2022). Focusing on adults
with disabilities can also create additional
inclusive factors as individuals with disabilities
exist among all races, ethnicities, genders,
family types, sexual orientations, and social
classes.
By
focusing
programming
on
individuals with disabilities, museums are also
aligning
themselves
to
become
more
inclusive. This inclusivity within the museum
refers to recognizing visitors for their unique
perspectives, offering them increased access
to galleries, and redefining traditional roles of
visitors (Inclusive Museum, 2020).
The MRWs created an inclusive opportunity
for artists and museum staff members to come
together
to
discuss
how
individuals
with
disabilities experience museums and create
art.
The
workshops
also
reestablished
the
importance
of
SI
(Villeneuve,
2013),
edu-
curation (Villeneuve & Love, 2017), and other
visitor-centered
concepts
built
from
the
museum education concepts introduced in the
1990s,
which
laid
the
foundation
for
this
research. However, this research also embodies
an enhanced focus on the inclusion of adults
with
developmental
disabilities
into
the
museum space as well as the examination of
power dynamics during the research process.
The artists, parents, caregivers, museum staff
members,
and
exhibiting
artists
who
participated in this research study indicated
that museums that wish to create inclusive and
visitor-centered
programs
for
adults
with
developmental disabilities need to focus on
the
themes
of
understanding,
accessibility,
interaction, collaboration, communication, and
evaluation when doing so. Both the artists and I
look forward to having these themes applied in
continued research and practice for improving
the museum experiences of all marginalized,
disenfranchised, and underserved groups of
visitors.
