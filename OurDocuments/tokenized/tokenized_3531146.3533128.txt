abstract
in
this
work
we
explore
the
intersection
fairness
and
robustness
in
the
context
of
ranking
when
ranking
model
has
been
calibrated
to
achieve
some
definition
of
fairness
is
it
possible
for
an
external
adversary
to
make
the
ranking
model
behave
unfairly
without
having
access
to
the
model
or
training
data
to
investigate
this
question
we
present
case
study
in
which
we
develop
and
then
attack
stateof-the-art
fairness-aware
image
search
engine
using
images
that
have
been
maliciously
modified
using
generative
adversarial
perturbation
gap
model
75
these
perturbations
attempt
to
cause
the
fair
re-ranking
algorithm
to
unfairly
boost
the
rank
of
images
containing
people
from
an
adversary-selected
subpopulation
we
present
results
from
extensive
experiments
demonstrating
that
our
attacks
can
successfully
confer
significant
unfair
advantage
to
people
from
the
majority
class
relative
to
fairly-ranked
baseline
search
results
we
demonstrate
that
our
attacks
are
robust
across
number
of
variables
that
they
have
close
to
zero
impact
on
the
relevance
of
search
results
and
that
they
succeed
under
strict
threat
model
our
findings
highlight
the
danger
of
deploying
fair
machine
learning
algorithms
in-the-wild
when
the
data
necessary
to
achieve
fairness
may
be
adversarially
manipulated
and
the
models
themselves
are
not
robust
against
attacks
the
machine
learning
ml
community
has
awoken
to
concerns
about
the
fairness
of
ml
models
the
elimination
of
unjustified
bias
against
specific
groups
of
people
from
models
there
is
now
extensive
literature
documenting
unfairness
in
deployed
ml
systems

well
as

models
companies
are
adopting
and
deploying
fair
ml
systems
in
many
real-world
contexts
10
96
most
ml
systems
that
strive
to
achieve
demographic
fairness
are
dependent
on
high-quality
demographic
data
to
control
for
unjustified
biases
13
94
recent
work
has
highlighted
how
critical
this
dependency
is
by
showing
how
unintentional
errors
in
demographic
data
can
dramatically
undermine
the
objectives
of
fair
ranking
algorithms
39
another
serious
concern
in
the
ml
community
is
model
robustness
especially
in
the
face
of
clever
and
dedicated
adversaries
the
field
of
adversarial
ml
has
demonstrated
that
seemingly
accurate
models
are
brittle
when
presented
with
maliciously
crafted
inputs
24
89
and
that
these
attacks
impact
models
across
variety
of
contexts
12
31

89
the
existence
of
adversarial
ml
challenges
the
use
of
models
in
real-world
deployments
in
this
work
we
explore
the
intersection
of
these
two
concerns
fairness
and
robustness
in
the
context
of
ranking
when
ranking
model
has
been
carefully
calibrated
to
achieve
some
definition
of
fairness
is
it
possible
for
an
external
adversary
to
make
the
ranking
model
behave
unfairly
without
having
access
to
the
model
or
training
data
in
other
words
can
attackers
intentionally
weaponize
demographic
markers
in
data
to
subvert
fairness
guarantees
to
investigate
this
question
we
present
case
study
in
which
we
develop
and
then
attack
fairness-aware
image
search
engine
using
images
that
have
been
maliciously
modified
with
adversarial
perturbations
we
chose
this
case
study
because
image
retrieval
based
on
text
queries
is
popular
real-world
use
case
for
neural
models
google
image
search
istock
getty
images
etc
and
because
prior
work
has
shown
that
these
models
can
potentially
be
fooled
using
adversarial
perturbations
101
although
not
in
the
context
of
fairness
to
strengthen
our
case
study
we
adopt
strict
threat
model
under
which
the
adversary
cannot
poison
training
data
48
for
the
ranking
model
and
has
no
knowledge
of
the
ranking
model
or
fairness
algorithm
used
by
the
victim
search
engine
instead
the
adversary
can
only
add
images
into
the
victim
database
after
the
image
retrieval
model
is
trained
for
our
experiments
we

to

in

relative

we
demonstrate
that
our

is
robust

of

including
the

the

the

additionally
our

are
stealthy
they
have
close

in
summary
we
show
that
gaps
can
be
used
to
subvert
fairness
guarantees
in
the
context
of
fair
image
retrieval
further
our
attack
is
successful
under
highly
restricted
threat
model
which
suggests
that
more
powerful
adversaries
will
also
be
able
to
implement
successful
attacks
we
hypothesize
that
similar
attacks
may
be
possible
against
other
classes
of
ml-based
systems
that
rely
on
highly
parameterized
models
and
make
fairness
decisions
for
inputs
that
are
based
on
data
controlled
by
adversaries
638
the
goal
of
our
work
is
not
to
hinder
or
deter
the
adoption
of
fair
ml
techniques
we
argue
that
fair
ml
techniques
must
be
adopted
in
practice
rather
our
goal
is
to
demonstrate
that
fairness
guarantees
can
potentially
be
weaponized
so
that
the
research
community
will
be
energized
to
develop
mitigations
by
making
models
more
robust
and
by
adopting
high-quality
sources
of
demographic
data
that
are
resistant
to
manipulation
to
facilitate
mitigation
development
without
arming
attackers

38
however
recent

shows
how

growing
field
of
research
that
aims
to
develop

and

that
can

of

for
example
prior
research
has
highlighted
that

are
often
not

presented
with

have

and

to

60

the
most
promising
defense
method
adversarial

is
computationally
expensive
and
imperfect
it
results
in

as
such

101
hypothesized
that
targeted

on
selected

in

might
be
possible
using
universal

none
of
these
works
consider
compromising
text-to-image

or
group
fairness
objectives
as
we
do
in
this

prior
work
has
demonstrated
adversarial
ml
attacks
against
fairness
objectives
of
ml
systems
at
training
time
in
these
attacks
the
adversary
supplies
poisoned
training
data
which
then
results
in
models
that
either
compromise
the
accuracy
of
targeted
subgroups

or
exacerbate

specific
to

there
exists

work
that
shows
how
to
learn
fair
models
when
sensitive
attributes
are
noisy
25
or
corrupted
in
poisoning

27
but
they
do
not
consider

adversarial
ml
attacks
at
test
time
after
training
model
using
non-malicious
data
that
we
consider
in
this
work
are
relatively
unexplored
in
fairness
settings
nanda
et
al
71
show
that
adversarial
ml
attacks
can
harm
certain
subpopulations
more
than
others
in
classification
tasks
however
while
this
is
an
important
observation
the
harms
suggested
by
this
work
may
be
difficult
to
realize
in
practice
as
they
only
involve
disparity
between
examples
that
are
adversarially
corrupted
by
contrast
our
work
shows
that
test-time
attacks
can
harm
fairness
for
benign
data
when
launched
in

methodology
we
now
present
the
plan
for
our
study
first
we
introduce
our
application
context
and
the
threat
model
under
which
an
attacker
will
attempt
to
compromise
the
application
second
we
discuss
the
ir
models
and
algorithms
underlying
our
fairness-aware

third
we
discuss
our
strategy
for
attacking

using

3.1
context
and
threat
model
in
this
study
we
consider
the
security
of
fairness-aware
image
search
engine
this
search
engine
indexes
images
from
around
the
web
either
automatically
via
crawler
or
from
user-provided
submissions
and
provides
free-text
interface
to
query
the
image
database
examples
of
image
search
engines
include
google
image
search
istock
and
getty
images
and
giphy
in
our
case
the
image
search
engine
attempts
to
produce
results
that
are
both
relevant
to
given
query
and
fair
according
to
some
fairness
objective
one
example
fairness
objective
is
demographic
representativeness
for
search
results
that
contain
images
of
people
we
consider
malicious
image
curator
imgur
4chan
or
similar
with
large
database
of
perturbed
images
that
are
eventually
scraped
or
uploaded
into
the
victim
image
search
engine
index
our
adversarial
image
curator
goal
is
to
perturb
the
images
in
their
database
to
subvert
the
fairness
guarantees
of
the
downstream
retrieval
system
we
assume
that
the
adversary
does
not
have
any
knowledge
of
the
internals
of
the
ranking
system
what
retrieval
model
is
used
other
images
in
the
index
or
which
fairness
algorithm
is
used
this
threat
model
constitutes
strict
but
realistic
limitation
on
our
adversary
notice
that
this
threat
model
would
also
apply
if
the
image
search
engine
was
compromised
giving
the
adversary
access
to
underlying
models
and
the
entire
dataset
of
images
we
consider
both
adversaries
in
our
experiments
we
also
note
that
if
the
adversary
only
seeks
to
target
small
set
of
queries
they
need
only
control
fraction
of
the
images
matching
each
query
rather
than
fraction
of
the
entire
image
database
this
is
useful
for
the
adversary
in
the
case
that
not
all
queries
are
equally
sensitive
3.2
building
an
image
search
engine
we
now
turn
our
attention
to

that
will

for
our

for
the
purpose
of
this
paper
we
used
multimodal

mmt
37
based
text-image
retrieval
model
this
model
consists
of
two
components
fast
although
somewhat
lower
quality
retrieval
step
that
identifies
large
set
of
relevant
images
followed
by
re-ranking
step
that
selects
the
best
images
from
the
retrieved
set
concretely
the
user
provides
string
that
queries
into
database
of
images
for
the
retrieval
step
the
query
string
is
encoded
with
an
embedding
function
fq
to
produce
an
embedding
vq
and
all
images
in
have
pre-computed
embeddings
from
an
embedding
function
the
cosine
distance
between
vq
and
all
embeddings
of
are
computed
to
collect
some
large

dq
of

plausible

these

are
then
ranked
according
to
joint
model
that
takes
both
the
indicating
query
and
an
image
as
input
returning
scores
si
how
well
each
image
dq
matches
the
query
these
scores
are
used
to
produce
the
final
ranking
note
that
the
mmt
model
is
not
designed
to
be
fair
in
any
normative
sense
to
achieve
fairness
results
from
the
model
must
be
re-ranked
which
we
describe
in
the
next
section
thus
the
mmt
model
is
not
the
target
of
our
attacks
since
it
is
not
responsible
for
implementing
any
fairness
objectives
3.2
fairness-aware
re-ranking
the
second
choice
we
make
for
this
study
is
selecting
an
algorithm
that
takes
the
output
of
the
image
retrieval
model
as
input
and
produces
fair
re-ranking
of
the
items
in
fairness-aware

according

th
of
the

the
heuristic
score
according
to
which
the
list
is
sorted
and
denotes
the
item
to
be
ranked
the
re-ranking
algorithm
we
adopt
is
fair
maximal
marginal
relevance
fmmr
51
which
was
developed
and
used
at
shopify
for
representative
ranking
of
images
fmmr
builds
on
the
maximal
marginal
relevance
23
technique
in
ir
that
seeks
to
maximize
the
information
in
ranked
list
by
choosing
the
next
retrieved
item
in
the
list
to
be
as
dissimilar
to
the
current
items
present
in
the
list
as
possible
mmr
introduces
hyperparameter
that
allows
the
operator
to
choose
the
trade-off
between
similarity
and
relevance
fmmr
modifies
the
similarity
heuristic
from
mmr
to
encode
for
similarity
in
terms
of
demographics
with
the
idea
being
that
the
next
relevant
item
chosen
to
be
placed
in
the
re-ranked
list
will
be
as
demographically
different
from
the
existing
images
as
possible
similarity
is
calculated
using
image
embeddings
for
which
we
examine
three
models

r-cnn
78
inceptionv3
88
and
resnet18
45
we
fix
the
trade-off
parameter
at
0.14
as
that
is
the
value
used
by
karako
and
manggala
51
in
their
fmmr
paper
it
is
notable
that
fmmr
does
not
require
demographic
labels
of
people
in
images
to
perform
fair
re-ranking
since
it
uses
heuristic
that
only
relies
on
embeddings
indeed
fmmr
comes
from
class
of
fair
ranking
algorithms
that
all
use
the
inherent
latent
representations
of
the
objects
for
their
re-ranking
strategy
51
79
that
said
since
fmmr
attempts
to
maximize
the
distance
from
the
centroids
of
the
embeddings
of
different
demographic
groups
it
can
be
thought
of
as
performing
indirect
demographic
inference
on
individuals
in
images
640
additionally
we
also
evaluated
our
attacks
against
second
fairness-aware
re-ranking
algorithm
detconstsort
38
developed
by
and
deployed
at
linkedin
in
their
talent
search
system
unlike
fmmr
detconstsort
explicitly
requires
demographic
labels
for
the
items
it
is
trying
to
fairly
re-rank
however
prior
work
39
shows
that
detconstsort
has
significant
limitations
when
demographic
inference
is
used
rather
than
ground-truth
demographic
labels
making
it
unfair
even
without
perturbed
images
as
result
evaluating
an
attack
against
detconstsort
is
not
meaningful
and
we
defer
our
discussion
of
detconstsort
to
3.3
attack
construction
having
described
our
search
engine
we
are
ready
to
turn
our
attention
to
our
attack
first
we
introduce
the
demographic
inference
models
deepface
90
and
fairface
52
that
we
use
to
train
our
attack
next
we
describe
how
we
generate
adversarial
perturbations
from
demographic
inference
model
modifying
images
in
way
that
is
imperceptible
to
human
eyes
yet
significant
enough
to
fool
the
fair
re-ranking
algorithm
of
our
search
engine
3.3
demographic

large-scale

as

pipelines

are
commonly
used
in
practice
when
demographic

are
not

the
bayesian

bisg
tool
is
used
to
measure
fairness
violations
in

22
and
it
relies
on
inferred
demographic
information
this
makes
attacks
on
demographic
inference
models
natural
candidate
for
adversely
affecting
ranking
fairness
we
consider
two
image
demographic
inference
models
to
train
our
attacks
deepface
90
is
face
recognition
model
for
gender
and
race
inference
developed
by
facebook
we
use
its
public
wrapper
82
which
includes
models
fine
tuned
on
roughly
22
000
samples
for
race
and
gender
classification
fairface
52
is
model
designed
for
race
and
gender
inference
trained
on
diverse
set
of
108
000
images
since
both
of
these
models
infer
race
ethnicity
we
used
mapping
to
infer
skin
tone
since
we
could
not
find
commercially
available
algorithms
to
infer
skin
tones
from
human
images
we
also
use
these
models
to
infer
demographics
as
input
to
the
detconstsort
algorithm
matching

pipeline

recall
our

curator
goal
to
produce
database
of
malicious
images
that
when
indexed
by
our
image
search
engine
undermine
its
purported
fairness
guarantees
concretely
this
means
fooling
the
fair
re-ranker
such
that
it
believes
given
set
of
search
results
is
fair
across
two
or
more
subgroups
when
in
fact
the
results
are
unfair
because
some
subgroups
are
under
or
over-represented
additionally
these
malicious

must
retain
their

the
mapping
we
used
is

middle

and

that

2.2
has
demonstrated
that
neural
image
classification
models
can
be
fooled
by
adding
adversarial
perturbations
to
images
at
high-level
the
adversary
goal
is
to
train
model
that
can
add
noise
to
images
such
that
specific
latent
characteristics
of
the
images
are
altered
in
our
case
these
altered
characteristics
should
impact
the
image
embeddings
calculated
by
the
image
embedding
model
inceptionv3
that
fmmr
relies
upon
to
do
fair
re-ranking
running
an
adversarial
perturbation
algorithm
on
each
of
the
images
in
the
adversary
database
would
be
prohibitive
as
these
algorithms
involve
computationally
expensive
optimization
algorithms
that
are
not
practical
at
the
scale
of
an
entire
database
we
avoid
this
limitation
by
training
generative
adversarial

gap
model
75
gap
model
gap
takes
clean
image
as

and
returns

targ
this
replaces
the
per-image
optimization
problem
with
much
less
expensive
forward
pass
of
gap
training
the
gap
is
one
time
expense
for
the
adversary
amortized
over
the
large
number
of

done
later
universal
adversarial
perturbations
uaps
66
are
another
approach
to
amortizing
runtime
but
require
all
images
to
be
the
same
dimensions
an
unrealistic
assumption
for
real-world
image
databases
having
motivated
the
choice
of
gap
model
for
our
attack
we
now
consider
the
problem
of
impacting
fairness
by
attacking
the
fair
re-ranking
algorithm
used
by
victim
search
engine
we
choose
to
design
gap
to
target
demographic
inference
model
di
this
will
produce
perturbations
that
to
deep
image
model
make
an
image
of
person
from
one
demographic
group
appear
to
be
from
different
demographic
group
this
attack
would
heavily
impact
demographic-aware
re-ranking
algorithm
such
as
detconstsort
38
see
if
it
used
an
accurate
demographic
inference
algorithm
to
produce
annotations
although
fmmr
does
not
use
annotations
we
show
in
that
our
attack
is
still
successful
at
compromising
fmmr
fairness
guarantees
our
attack
can
be
seen
as
an
application
of
the
transferability
property
of
adversarial
examples
additionally
training
our
gap
against
demographic
inference
model
causes
our
attack
to
be
independent
of
the
ranking
algorithm
and
image
corpus
used
by
the
victim
search
engine
both
of
which
are
strong
adversarial
assumptions
in
designing
our
gap
to
compromise
fairness
we
first
note
that
an
attack
that
simply
forces
di
to
make
arbitrarily
many
errors
may
not
impact
fairness
for
example
suppose
the
image
database
contained
two
subpopulations
the
advantaged
class
and
the
disadvantaged
class
suppose
the
attack
causes
di
to
misclassify
all
members
of
as
and
all
members
of
as
this
is
the
best
possible
result
of
an
attack
on
the
demographic
inference
algorithm
but
results
in
no
changes
to
fair
ranking
algorithm
it
will
simply
consider
to
be
the
disadvantaged
class
and
thus
produce
the
same
ranking
for
this
reason
our
adversary
must
incorporate
subpopulations
into
the
attack
to
do
so
we
propose
the
class-targeted
generative
adversarial
perturbation
cgap
definition
cgap
we
consider
loss
function
target
model
targ
distribution
over
inputs
and
outputs
the
adversary
provides
source
class
ys
and
target
class
yt
then
the
cgap
model
cgap
is
model
that
takes
as
input
an
image
and
returns
an
image
minimizing
the
following
loss
functions
‚Ñìcgap
cgap
yt
targ
ys
‚Ñìcgap
cgap
targ
ys
that
is
the
cgap
should
force
the
demographic
inference
model
to
misclassify
samples
of
class
ys
to
class
yt
while
maintaining
its
performance
for
samples
not
from
class
ys
we
also
consider
two
extensions
of
this
definition
first
we
permit
the
adversary
to
target
multiple
classes
at
once
in
the
extreme
an
adversary
may
want
all
samples
to
be
classified
to
the
same
class
this
approach
is
proposed
by
75
for
demographic
inference
algorithm
all
samples
having
the
same
demographic
label
will
cause
the
fair
re-ranking
system
to
have
similar
performance
to
an
unfair
ranking
system
as
all
points
will
appear
to
fall
into
the
same
subpopulation
the
second
extension
is
the
untargeted
attack
where
the
cgap
simply
increases
loss
for
points
from
class
ys
inducing
arbitrary
misclassifications
simultaneously
making
both
relaxations
recovers
the
original
untargeted
gap
approach
we
experiment
with
both
relaxations
independently
as
well
as
multiple
instantiations
of
cgap
as
defined
above
experiments
in
this
section
we
introduce
the
dataset
we
used
for
our
evaluation
describe
the
setup
for
our
experiments
and
define
the
metrics
we
use
to
evaluate
our
attacks
4.1
dataset
annotation
and
preprocessing
we
use
microsoft
common
objects
in
context
ms-coco
59
as
our
retrieval
dataset
since
it
contains
variety
of
images
with
variable
dimensions
and
depths
this
closely
mimics
what
realworld
image
search
dataset
might
contain
to
specifically
measure
for
demographic
bias
we
filter
the
dataset
keeping
only
images
that
contain
people
we
also
need
the
images
to
have
demographic
annotations
for
fair
ranking
so
we
use
an
annotated
subset
of
the
coco
2014

constructed
by
zhao

4.2
experimental

we
need
to

ranked
lists
from
our
baseline
unfair
retrieval
system
as
described
in
3.2
to
do
so
we
run
three
different
search
queries
on
the

system
tennis
player
person
eating
pizza
and
person

we
chose
these
queries
because
they
all
reference
human
uap
can
also
be
seen
as
gap
where
gap
for
fixed
therefore
we
expect
that
gap
will
perform
strictly
better
than
uap
recall
that
per
our
threat
model
in
3.1
the
attacker
does
not
know
what
fair
re-ranking
algorithm
is
used
by
the
victim
and
thus
cannot
train
against
it

the

we

how
in
the
absence
of
safeguards
fairness
interventions
can
potentially
be
weaponized
by
malicious
parties
as
tool
of
oppression
in
the
absence
of
fair
ml
development
methods
and
algorithms
that
are
robust
to
adversarial
attacks
it
may
not
be
possible
for
policymakers
to
safely
mandate
the
use
of
fair
ml
algorithms
in
practice
we
believe
that
future
work
is
needed
to
develop
more
robust
fair
ml
interventions
we
adopt
broad
view
of
possible
mitigations
spanning
from
value
sensitive
design

methods
that

above
all
this
work
highlights
that
achieving
demographic
fairness
requires
high-quality
demographic
data
allowing
an
adversary
to
influence
demographic
meta-data
is
the
underlying
flaw
that
enables
our
attack
to
succeed
demographic
data
may
be
sourced
from
data
subjects
themselves
with
full
knowledge
and
consent
or
from
human
labelers

with
the
caveat
that
these
labels
themselves
will
need
to
be
de-biased

6.1
limitations
our
study
has
number
of
limitations
first
our
analysis
is
limited
to
two
discrete
racial
and
two
discrete
gender
categories
although
646
our
cgap
attack
could
be
tailored
to
select
any
group
it
is
unclear
how
well
our
attack
would
perform
in
situations
with
discrete
protected
groups
groups
with
continuous
attributes
people
with
multiple
or
partial
group
memberships
or
with
population
distributions
that
varied
significantly
from
our
dataset
second
while
our
dataset
is
sufficiently
large
to
demonstrate
our
attack
it
is
smaller
than
the
databases
that
real-world
image
search
engines
retrieve
from
third
our
proof-of-concept
was
tuned
to
attack
fairface
and
deepface
it
is
unclear
how
well
our
cgap
attack
would
generalize
to
other
models
or
real-world
deployed
systems
fourth
as
we
observe
in
figure
our
attack
is
only
successful
at
generating
unfairness
in
favor
of
already-advantaged
groups
while
this
is
limitation
it
in
no
way
diminishes
the
potential
real-world
harm
our
attack
could
inflict
on
marginalized
populations
finally
as
shown
in
figure
our
attack
effectiveness
varies
by
query
in
real
world
scenarios
an
attacker
could
mitigate
this
to
some
extent
by
devoting
more
of
their
resources
towards
perturbing
images
that
are
relevant
to
high-value
queries
it
is
unclear
how
much
the
attackers
effort
would
need
to
vary
in
practice
given
that
we
make
no
attempt
to
attack
deployed
search
engines
6.2
ethics
in
this
work
we
present
concrete
attack
against
fair
ranking
system
like
all
adversarial
attack
research
our
methods
can
potentially
be
misused
by
bad
actors
however
this
also
necessitates
our
research
since
documenting
vulnerabilities
is
the
first
step
towards
mitigating
them
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
with
the
exception
of
shopify
and
linkedin
few
services
are
known
to
employ
fair
ranking
systems
in
practice
meaning
there
currently
exists
window
of
opportunity
to
preemptively
identify
attacks
raise
awareness
and
deploy
mitigations
prior
work
on
adversarial
ml
attacks
against
fairness
made
their
source
code
publicly
available
71
however
because
attack
tools
are
dual-use
we
have
opted
to
take
more
conservative
approach
we
will
only
share
source
code
with
researchers
from
research
universities
as
identified
by
taxonomies
like
the
carnegie
classification
and
companies
that
develop
potentially
vulnerable
products
given
that
our
attack
can
be
used
for
legitimate
blackbox
algorithm
auditing
purposes
we
opt
to
restrict
who
may
access
subverting
fair
image
search
with
generative
adversarial
perturbations

our
source
code
rather
than
the
uses
it
may
be
put
towards
in
our
opinion
this
process
will
facilitate
follow-up
research
mitigation
development
and
algorithm
auditing
without
supplying
bad
actors
with
ready-made
attack
tools
like
many
works
in
the
computer
vision
field
we
rely
on
images
with
crowdsourced
and
inferred
demographic
labels
both
processes
have
been
criticized
for
their
lack
of
consent
41
the
way
they
operationalize
identity
81
and
the
harm
they
may
cause
through
mis-identification
14
these
problems
reinforce
the
need
for
highquality
consensual
demographic
data
as
means
to
improve
ethical
norms
and
defend
against
adversarial
ml
attacks

supplementary
material
comparison
between
detconstsort
and
fmmr
in
this
section
we
compare
the
performance
of
two
fair
re-rankers
in
the
presence
of
our
gap
attack
we
have
already
described
the
details
of
the
first
algorithm
fmmr
in
3.2
1.1
detconstsort
the
second
algorithm
detconstsort
38
was
developed
by
and
is
currently
deployed
at
linkedin
in
their
talent
search
system
unlike
fmmr
detconstsort
requires
access
to
the
demographic
labels
of
the
items
it
is
trying
to
fairly
re-rank
detconstsort
rearranges
given
list
of
items
such
that
for
any
particular
rank
and
for
any
attribute
the
attribute
is
present
at
least
pa
times
in
the
ranked
list
where
pa
is
the
proportion
of
items
in
the
list
that
have
the
attribute
detconstsort
also
re-sorts
the
items
within
the
relevance
criteria
so
that
items
with
better
utility
scores
are
placed
higher
in
the
ranked
list
as
much
as
possible
while
maintaining
the
desired
attribute
ratio
it
thus
aims
to
solve
deterministic
interval
constrained
sorting
problem
if
ground-truth
demographic
labels
are
unavailable
detconstsort
may
instead
utilize
labels
sourced
from
demographic
inference
model
recent
work
however
has
shown
that
detconstsort
is
sensitive
to
errors
in
demographic
labels
with
one
example
of
such
errors
being
inaccurate
inferences
39
1.2
evaluation
results
we
present
the
results
of
our
gap
attacks
against
our
search
engine
when
it
uses
detconstsort
and
fmmr
as
the
fair
re-ranker
respectively
in
figure
as
in
these
results
are
averaged
across
three
queries
multiple
values
of
etc
for
detconstsort
the
skew
and
attention
metrics
are
not
impacted
by
our
attack
this
can
be
clearly
seen
by
comparing
the
values
when
pr
there
are
no
perturbed
images
to
other
values
of
pr
for
detconstsort
for
skew
and
attention
starts
high
unfair
when
pr
and
does
not
change
as
pr
increases
the
correct
interpretation
of
these
results
is
not
that
detconstsort
is
resilient
to
our
attack
rather
the
correct
interpretation
is
that
detconstsort
starts
off
unfair
due
to
the
use
of
inaccurate
inferred
demographic
data
39
and
our
attack
is
unable
to
make
the
unfairness
worse
thus
we
find
that
prerequisite
for
evaluating
the
success
of
our
attacks
on
detconstsort
is
an
accurate
demographic
inference
model
developing
such
models
is
still
an
active
area
of
research
and
is
out-of-scope
for
our
work
should
more
accurate
demographic
inference
model
be
designed
in
the
future
however
it
must
be
designed
with
adversarial
robustness
in
mind
to
prevent
our
attacks
choice
of
queries
to
facilitate
our
experiments
we
chose
to
select
search
query
terms
that
would
provide
sizeable
list
of
images
to
do
so
we
looked
at
the
list
of
terms
in
the
coco
image
captions
excluding
english
stop
words
and
words
related
to
ethnicity
or
gender
the
following
table
shows
some
top
terms
from
this
information
we
composed
our
three
queries
given
that
sitting
tennis
table
person
pizza
etc
were
among
the
most
popular
terms
