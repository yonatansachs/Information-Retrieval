fairness
and
equity
have
become
central
to
ranking
problems
in
information
access
systems
such
as
search
engines
recommender
systems
or
marketplaces
to
date
several
types
of
fair
ranking
measures
have
been
proposed
including
diversity
exposure
and
pairwise
fairness
measures
out
of
those
pairwise
fairness
is
family
of
metrics
whose
normative
grounding
has
not
been
clearly
explicated
leading
to
uncertainty
with

to
the
construct
that
is
being
measured
and
how
it
relates
to
stakeholders
desiderata
in
this
paper
we
develop
normative
and
behavioral
grounding
for
pairwise
fairness
in
ranking
leveraging
measurement
theory
and
user
browsing
models
we
derive
an
interpretation
of
pairwise
fairness
centered
on
the
construct
of
producer
dissatisfaction
tying
pairwise
fairness
to
perceptions
of
ranking
quality
highlighting
the
key
limitations
of
prior
pairwise
measures
we
introduce
set
of
reformulations
that
allow
us
to
capture
behavioral
and
practical
aspects
of
ranking
systems
these
reformulations
form
the
basis
for
novel
pairwise

of

our

in
nutshell
measures
of
pairwise
fairness
quantify
how
often
the
rank
of
two
items
from
different
groups
reflects
their
merit
and
whether
mismatched
pairs
are
systemat
ically
in
favor
of
one
group
this
notion
of
equity
is
less
clearly
connected
with
immediate
producer
benefits
and
thus
deserves
further
scrutiny
in
this
paper
we
perform
an
in-depth
study
of
pairwise
fairness
first
we
provide
an
interpretation
of
pairwise
fairness
grounded
in

developing
rigorous
distinction
between
the
construct
and
its
operationalization
26
we
show
that
pairwise
fairness
can
capture
perceived
unfairness
on
part
of
item
producers
and
thus
operationalize
their
dissatisfaction
with

output
of

26
we
examine

to
capture

the
operationalization
the

operationalization
should

enunciat

what
it
means
for
an
algorithm
to
be
equitable
and
from
whose
perspective
however
fairness
measures
are
often
introduced
as
self-evident
prerequisites
for
equity
resulting
in
downstream
un
certainty
as
to
what
exactly
is
being
measured
or
optimized
these
considerations
are
especially
applicable
to
measures
of
pairwise
fairness
in
ranking
for
example
ree

based
on
the
postulate
that
there
is

in
considering
error-based

criteria

we

alternative
interpretations
of

based
on

and
before
generalizing
those
interpretations
to
pairwise

metrics
item-centric
producers
of

evaluate

by
focusing
on
the
most

cases
of

time
they
encounter

for
that
is
an
item
of
lesser

ranked
better
than
their
own

thus
connected
to
observed
injustice
which
can
affect
the
perceived
quality
of

service
18
28
and
in
turn
influence
the
loyalty
of
item
producers
31
user-centric
interpretations
on
the
other
hand
center
on
wasted
effort
due
to
user
attention
being
diverted
to
items
of
lower
interest
from
different
group
users
visit
an
item
with
probability
taking
into
account
its
group
say
they
evaluate
how
much
effort
they
wasted
to
reach
this
item
because
they
examined
items
of
inferior
relevance
from
different
groups
according
to
this
interpretation
the
counter
measures
wasted
effort
to
reach
items
in
group
that
are
unduly
ranked
below
items
in
group
and
represents
normalized
expectation
of
cross-group
wasted
effort
over
the
browsing
model
toward

the
fact
that
multiple
interpretations
are
possible
speaks
to
the
flex
ibility
of
pairwise
measures
in
operationalizing
multiple
constructs
the
inner
summation
is
weighted
yet
both
igi
and

exhibit
certain
limitations
when
it
comes
counter
of

with

proportional
to
the

that

around

dips
becomes
flat
as
these
ranks
have
low
visibility
ree
also
increases
with
but
unlike
dips
the
increase
accelerates
with
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
to
satisfy
the
mini
mum

requirement
the
number
of
upds
increases
superlinearly
with
ee
ea

ea-dp

the

since

have

as

minimized
by
the

ea

close

as
in
this
particular

women

ea-dp

different
ranking
policies
naïvely
enforcing

without
paying
attention
to

would
yield
high

interpretation
on
the
one
hand
this
experiment
shows
that
when
dips
and
exposure-based
measures
are
instantiated
with
the
same
top-heavy
browsing
model
they
are
similarly
influenced
by
fairness
interventions
toward
the
top
of
ranking
while
ignoring
swaps
at
less
visible
positions
they
display
similar
profiles
as
result
on
the
other
hand
the
absolute
values
of
these
measures
can
differ
substantially
in
essence
exposure-based
measures
are
based
on
comparison
between
groupwise
merit
and
groupwise
representation
among
the
most
visible
items
in
the
final
ranking
although
dips
is
focused
similarly
on
the
most
visible
items
it
takes
into
account
their
individual
merits
for
instance
an
item
whose
relevance
is
in
the
highest
decile
can
be
promoted
to
the
most
visibile
position
with
sizeable
impact
on
exposure
without
increasing
the
dissatisfaction
counter
of
most
items
with
small
impact
on
the
aggregate
dips
measure
while
showing
some
clear
similarities
dips
and
exposure-based
measures
operationalize
different
constructs
and
capture
different
properties
overall
our
analyses
show
that
fairness-enhancing
interventions
in
ranking
may
cause
dissatisfaction
for
non-protected
groups
but
merit-based
policies
will
mitigate
this
downside

we
have

the
limitations
of

in

this
is
due
to
the
fact
that

have
greater
relevance
than
most
of

words
despite
substantial

for
female

the
most

for
example
when

among
the
twenty
most

accounting
for
more
than
80
of
overall
exposure
we
find
ten
female
entrepreneurs
who
are
in
the
top
decile
for
raised
funding
overall
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
fairness
manipulation
used
is
aware
of
relevance
so
women
https://crunchbase.com/
recall
that

we
have
shown
how
to
ground

highlighting
the
similarities
between
exposure-based

and
dips
at
the
same
time
we
have
stressed
the
differences
between
the
two
families
of
mea
sures
which
arise
as
they
operationalize
fundamentally
different
constructs
overall
this
work
grounds
and
generalizes
measures
of

situates
them
more
precisely
in
the
