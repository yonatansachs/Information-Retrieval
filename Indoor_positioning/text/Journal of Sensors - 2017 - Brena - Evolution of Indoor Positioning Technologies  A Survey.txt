Some works belonging to the passive mobile camera
approach use visual odometry (VO) to update the user
position. VO is “the process of estimating the egomotion
of an agent (e.g., vehicle, human, and robot) using only
the input of a single or multiple cameras attached to it”
[80]. VO is not a recent approach and has been around
forsome30yearsbuthasbeengraduallyimprovedbothin
efficiency and in precision [81]. An example of VO work is
presented by Kitt et al. [82], who used a sequence of stereo
images and, with filtering techniques, were able to achieve
