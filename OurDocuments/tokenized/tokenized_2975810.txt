along
with
four

in

introduction
over

the
vast
increase
in
outputs
from
omics
genomics
transcriptomics
proteomics
and
metabolomics
assays
together
with
decreasing
assay
and
data
storage
costs
have
resulted
in
an
exponentially
increasing
volume
of
these
big

the
high
feature-number
aspect
of
these
big
data
has
highlighted
the
importance
of
data
sharing
or
reuse
functions
of
these
systems
as
data
sets
often
have
relevance
for
investigating
very
large
number
of
hypotheses
thus
developers
of
big

systems
increasingly
are
focusing
on
the
needs
of

to
discover

system

should

chosen

developers
of

we

from
our

developing

all

states
that

the
fm-f1a
metric
focuses
on

uniqueness
and
fm-f1b
on

the
objective
is
to
make

but
the
implementation
of

also
supports

fair
principle
a1
the
qualifier
global
should
be
interpreted
as
global
within
the
domain
of
conceivable
use
of
the
data
thus
it
is
not
sufficient
to
use
locally
system-specific
controlled
processes
to
manage
data
identifiers24
as
this
approach
can
never
absolutely
guarantee
against
overlap
with
other

local

in

specifies
the
persistence
of

identification
systems
that
employ
uniform
resource
locators
which
rely
on
alterable
domain
name
resolution
cannot
guarantee
persistence
of

among
the
schemes
for
providing
data
identifiers
the
most
reliable
over
time
are
likely
to
be
those
that
use
third
party
resolution
versus
those
that
rely
on
in-house
redirection
third-party

include
digital
object
identifiers

and
those
provided
by

all
but
one
of
the
systems
we
assessed
passed
the

for

by
employing
persistent
globally
unique
identifiers
with
third

mg
rast
only
offers
such

as
an
option
during

submission
and
so
was
assessed
as
partial

in
the
biomedical
research
and
clinical
practice
realms
publishers
have
now
widely
selected
the
doi
scheme
for
identification
and
citation
of
literature
more
than
80
of
2015
articles
indexed
by
pubmed
have
assigned
dois26
as
consequence
the
biomedical
community
is
already
and
continues
to
become
more
and
more
familiar
with
using
these
identifiers
to
retrieve
and
cite
literature
yet
to
date
only
few
omics
data
repositories
have
similarly
implemented
dois
for
data
publications
consequently
actual
findability
and
accessibility
of
data
in
these
repositories
is
less
than
optimal
even
though
they
are
technically
in
compliance
with
f1
and
will
continue
to
be
so
unless
and
until
the
biomedical
community
is
trained
on
how
to
use
other
identifying
schemes
for
citing
data
furthermore
metadata
from
these
repositories
are
not
currently
indexed
in

meta-indexes
such
as
the
one
produced
by
datacite27
in
order
to
be
compliant
with
f1
and
a1
the
glds
is
implementing
methods
to
issue
dois
for
all
data
publications
additionally
curated
metadata
records
of
the

are
transmitted
to
datacite27
for
meta

increasing
the
chances
for
reuse
of
glds-hosted
data
fair
data
also
need
to
be
described
with
rich
metadata
in
order
to
be
findable
the
draft
metric
to
assess
f2
compliance
merely
requires
metadata
description
document
that
specifies
format
for
machine-readable
metadata
the
definition
of
the
term
machine-readable
varies
somewhat
but
it
is
generally
agreed
that
it
cannot
be
natural
language
although
f2
refers
to
reusability
principles
requiring
data
have
plurality
of
accurate
and
relevant
attributes
r1
the
metric
for
f2
does
not
attempt
to
assess
compliance
with
principle
r1
perhaps
it
should
all
the
systems
we
assessed
passed
this
metric
furthermore
all
systems
passed
f3
requiring
association
of
metadata
with
data
it
describes
it
should
be
noted
that
fm-f3
refers
only
to
iris
and
not
broadly
to
any
other
kinds
of
acceptable
data
identifiers
we
assume
that
ultimately
fm-f3
will
be
broadened
to
allow
other
kinds
of
f1-compliant
data
identifiers
also
it
is
difficult
to
determine
if
any
of
the
systems
truly
support
iris
given
that
none
of
them
currently
appear
to
use
non-ascii
character
encodings
in
their
data
identifying
schemes
the
fairness
metric
fm-f4
is
rather
ill-defined
currently
it
requires
submission
of
an
identifier
of
fair
data
and
its
metadata
to
search
engines
which
precisely
it
does
not
yet
specify
but
some
common
search
engines
are
mentioned
as
examples
in
the
comments
for
the
metric
pass
should
be
given
if
the
returned
search
results
include
links
to
the
published
data
again
it
does
not
yet
specify
where
in
the
returned
results
although
among
both
the
top

some
of
the

we

failed
this

it

their

are
likely
not
indexed
by
at
least
some

more
of
the

passed
all

open

protocols
to
access

which
are
retrieved
by
their

fair
principle
a1
stipulates
that
any
protocol
used
to
retrieve
data
allows
for
an
authentication
and
authorization
procedure
where
necessary
all
the
systems
we
assessed
describe
which
functions
of
the
system
require
credentials
and
how
to
obtain
the
credentials
it
should
be
noted
that
a1
can
be
applied
to
the
design
of
all
types
of
systems
from
those
with
highly
restricted
236
access
controls
to
the
kinds
of
open
access
systems
we
assessed
that
typically
require
minimal
authentication
and
grant
the
widest
possible
access
to
all
users
furthermore
the
data
in
question
could
be
any
kind
of
data
including
raw
instrument
output
shared
data
analysis
workflows
or
data
products
or
scientifically-relevant
user
comments
and
opinions
even
for
open
access
systems
some
systems
functions
such
as
user-workspace
file
management
user
commenting
and
messaging
and
user
attribution
of
data
always
require
authentication
because
these
functions
must
necessarily
leverage
user-specific
information
specific
challenge
that
genelab
faced
when
implementing
a1
for
the
glds
was
diversity
of
credentialing
services
available
to
the
system
target
users
with
no
single
service
common
to
all
users
furthermore
the
goal
of
genelab
is
to
maximize
access
to
glds
data
across
all
kinds
of
users
but
within
the
bounds
of
authentication
and
credentialing
policies
of
nasa
another
challenge
aside
from
policy
restrictions
the
development
of
any
new
credentialing
and
authentication
functions
or
services
can
require
considerable
resources
solution
for
organizations
that
are
seeking
to
develop
open-access
systems
is
to
consider
investing
in
development
of
an
organization-wide
integrated
credentialing
and
authentication
architecture
icaa
figure
and
policies
for
allowing
users
to
leverage
extramural
credentials
with
appropriate
access
limitations
icaas
and
attendant
policies
can
provide
flexibility
to
develop
and
or
deploy
data
systems
with
available
resources
that
can
meet
policy
requirements
of
the
organization
that
support
extramural
user
access
it
should
be
noted
that
using
an
icaa
to
leverage
credentialing
systems
developed
independently
from
the
system
requires
technical
compatibility
between
the
authentication
services
of
credentialing
providers
and
the
icaa
and
compatibility
of
the
credentialing
policies
of
credentialing
organizations
and
those
of
the
organization
developing
the
data
system
technical
compatibility
is
facilitated
through
the
use
of
authentication
protocols
and
standards
organizational
credentialing
policy
incompatibility
is
more
problematic
to
resolve
for
example
it
may
be
that
the
organization
deploying
the
data
system
requires
credentials
be
updated
at
an
interval
that
is
different
from
that
required
by
one
or
more
extramural
credential
provider
if
these
differences
cannot
be
resolved
the
only
option
may
be
to
limit
access
for
some
extramural
users
data
system
functions
requiring
authentication
nasa
is
developing
an
icaa
and
adopting
policies
that
permit
certain
intramural
data
systems
to
leverage
it
for
user
credentials
and
authentication
these
policies
stipulates
that
users
within
the
organization
must
use
the
organization
own
credentialing
services
while
extramural
users
may
authenticate
using
one
from
defined
set
of
externally
managed
credentialing
systems
currently
including
authentication
by
selected
social
media
systems
such
as
google
com
credentials
at
nasa
and
at
most
federal
agencies
intramural
credentialing
is
quite
long
process
involving
corroboration
of
much
identifying
information
the
use
of
the
icaa
users
without
nasa
credentials
can
specify
minimum
of
information
only
verifiable
email
address
which
they
can
provide
easily
through
web
browser
and
gain
almost
immediate
access
to
the
glds
through
use
of
the
icaa
the
glds
is
able
to
recognize
lower
level
of
confidence
when
authenticating
extramural
users
and
implement
appropriate
access
controls
to
some
functions
for
these
users
they
may
not
join
system
administrator
groups
it
seems
reasonable
to
suggest
that
an
additional
principle
be
considered
when
designing
fair
extramural
data
systems
that
have
at
least
some
credentialing
organizational
boundary

requiring

additional
principles
for

data

minimized
systems
should
ensure
that
policies
for

are
clearly
stated
including
which
metadata
and
for
what
period
of
time
another
factor
that
specifically
affects
accessibility
to
big
data
is
data
transport
data
to
be
used
as
inputs
in
big
data
systems
but
which
are
not
located
in
the
same
environment
as
executable
code
of
the
system
commonly
must
first
be
transported
duplicated
or
moved
to
the
environment
first
this
environment
typically
is
user-specific
workspace
the
transport
process
for
big
data
can
require
minutes
hours
or
even
days
in
some
big
data
systems
and
represents
significant
barrier
to
efficient
access
designers
of
big

would
benefit
from
principle
that
stipulates
the
collocation
within
big

of

in

interoperability
i1
stipulates
the
use
formal
accessible
etc
language
for
knowledge
representation
the
draft
metric
for
this
principle
requires
that
the
language
for
data
or
metadata
be
available
by
url
and
have
bnf
representation
the
comments
on
the
metric
suggest
additional
required
language
qualities
including
that
the
language
must
have
semantics
vanilla
xml
and
json
should
fail
while
current
knowledge
representation
languages
such
as
rdf
and
owl28
are
available
to
generate
metadata
specifications
with
inherent
semantics
tools
that
leverage
such
languages
require
some
sophistication
in
their
use
all
the
repositories
we
assessed
have
metadata
specifications
that
do
not
have
inherent
semantics
and
thus
would
not
yield
pass
for
this
metric
metabolights
and
the
glds
both
use
the
isatab
metadata
specification
which
can
be
converted
to
rdf
and
so
were
rated
with
partial
pass
the
metric
for
principle
i2
has
related
requirement
that
data
systems
use
open
community-developed
vocabularies
for
data
and
metadata
and
that
such
vocabularies
be
more
than
simple
keywords
include
semantics
in
some
form
as
the
isatab
specification
supported
ontological
lookup
from
such
vocabularies
we
again
only
rated
metabolights
and
the
glds
with
partial
pass
and
the
rest
of
the
systems
as
fail
in
addition
to
lack
of
experience
with
knowledge
representation
technologies
like
rdf
and
owl
another
likely
reason
for
lack
of
compliance
of
the
systems
with
i1
and
i2
is
general
lack
of
available
semantic
resources
developed
by
the
community
to
generate
metadata
specifications
and
vocabularies
particularly
in
more
recent
domains
like
genomics
proteomics
and
metabolomics
we
have
ourselves
sought
such
resources
for
use
in
the
glds
development
where
we
are
seeking
to
provide
users
with
omics
data
analysis
capabilities
an
omics
workbench
consisting
of
user
specific
workspaces
and
data
access
controls
together
with
access
to
suite
of
omics
analysis
tools
see
figure
1b
and
figure
1c
users
of
these
tools
will
create
data
processing
analysis
workflows
to
transform
input
data
into
higher-order
data
products
which
they
will
likely
want
to
share
with
others
and
or
associate
with
the
workflows
and
data
inputs
one
of
the
challenges
we
have
observed
for
making
these
kinds
of
processed
information
fair
include
lack
of
semantic
resources
for
creating
metadata
specifications
for
such
processed
data
and
the
processing
workflows
that
generate
them
while
schemas
like
the
common
workflow
language29
cwl
specification
provide
method
to
represent
and
reproduce
the
mechanics
of
data
processing
they
lack
domain-specific
semantics
regarding
the
nature
of
these
data
transformations
what
are
the
goals
of
the
transformation
from
biological
perspective
what
are
the
biological
data
concepts
produced
in
output
files
how
do
these
relate
to
input
data
elements
etc
without
these
descriptors
systems
may
not
adequately
index
these
processed
data
and
workflows
for
discovery
and
retrieval
while
sophisticated
users
trained
bioinformaticians
who
do
encounter
processed
data
and
workflows
may
be
able
to
understand
and
reuse
them
others
without
domain-specific
experience
and
knowledge
of
omics

may
not
challenge
for
the
glds
will
be
to
help
spur
the
creation
of
community
resources
so
that
it
can
implement
rich
metadata
for
processed
omics
data
and
workflows
in
timely
fashion
the
objective
of
the
metric
for
principle
i3
is
to
measure
how
much
data
in
one
system
are
linked
semantically
to
data
in
other
systems
it
is
not
surprising
that
none
of
the
data
sources
link
data
out
to
data
in
external
systems
in
semantically
qualified
ways
this
is
challenging
objective
for
any
data
system
we
ignored
links
to
records
that
were
merely
duplicated
between
systems
manual
linking
of
data
requires
subject
matter
expertise
and
can
be
time
consuming
for
systems
with
many
data
records
automated
linking
requires
that
source
and
linked
data
both
be
238
characterized
semantically
so
that
links
may
be
inferred
as
mentioned
above
semantic

reusability
r1
is
referred
to
by
the
findability
fair
principle
f2
see
above
at
this
time
there
is
no
metric
specifically
for
r1
r1
requires
data
systems
to
provide
licenses
for
data
usage
and
is
curiously
intended
to
facilitate
legal
interoperability
rather
than
reusability30
all
the
data
repositories
we
assessed
are
governmental
entities
and
as
such
licensing
is
traditionally
prohibited
r1
and
r1
require
that
data
are
published
together
with
provenance
metadata
and
that
data
and
metadata
conform
to
community-derived
standards
respectively
such
standards
include
taxonomies
ontologies
and
other
vocabularies
for
metadata
and
data
and
file
formats
the
metric
for
r1
involves
the
demonstration
that
system
can
provide
fair-compliant
citational
and
contextual
provenance
metadata
while
all
the
repositories
provide
such
metadata
some
do
not
use
fair-compliant
schemes
for
these
metadata
similarly
most
of
the
repositories
assess
and
validate
submitted
data
files
but
few
validate
metadata
as
discussed
above
against
fair-schemes
and
formats
discussion
the
systems
we
assessed
for
fairness
clearly
have
shortcomings
particularly
in
the
area
of
supporting
data
interoperability
none
of
the
systems
currently
use
metadata
representation
language
with
sufficient
semantics
in
addition
none
fully
leverage
fair
vocabularies
for
metadata
there
are
perhaps
several
causes
at
work
for
these
observations
there
are
often
myriad
vocabularies
ontologies
for
metadata
each
of
which
is
de
facto
community
standard
even
within
given
biological
sub-domain
and
often
much
overlap
in
semantic
content
between
them
creating
the
need
for
systems
to
be
able
to
normalize
input
metadata
across
them
somehow
for
example
the
concept
of
zero
or
very
low-gravity
experimental
conditions
appears
in
at
least
different
widely-used
biomedical
vocabularies
snomed
ct
mesh
read
codes
clinical
terms
psychology
ontology
plos
thesaurus
and
fast
topical
facet
with
varying
language
for
the
concept

zero
gravity
true
semantic
interoperability
and
data
reusability
that
would
permit
user
to
find
all
data
tagged
with
this
concept
require
either
that
all
these
concept
instances
be
individually
associated
with
the
data
or
use
of
system
that
reliably
maps
all
the
concepts
from
these
ever-changing
ever-expanding
set
of
ontologies
even
if
such
metadata
normalizing
mechanisms
are
developed
their
performance
and
value
in
generating
rich
metadata
is
dependent
on
the
quality
of
input
concepts
supplied
either
by
original
data
submitters
or
biodata
curators
typically
employed
by
the
system
the
expertise
that
submitters
have
is
critical
to
shaping
metadata
that
have
value
for
many
different
kinds
of
audiences
and
that
allow
associated
data
to
be
found
and
reused
in
the
biomedical
field
submitters
to
shared
data
repositories
have
relatively
low
motivation
to
go
to
any
great
lengths
to
provide
rich
metadata
or
assist
biocurators
in
generating
them
this
is
likely
due
at
least
in
part
to
the
fact
that
only
small
fraction
of
shared
data
appears
to
be
cited
in
publication
references
when
they
are
reused
31
without
their
input
niche
repositories
and
data
systems
like
the
glds
with
limited
resources
for
acquiring
and
maintaining
rich
metadata
that
meet
all
the
criteria
above
must
constantly
trade
the
use
of
resources
to
acquire
or
generate
rich
metadata
with
those
that
could
be
used
for
other
worthy
goals
the
findability
and
interoperability
principles
when
implemented
in
data
systems
support
data
integration
functions
like
multi-source

f2
i1
i2

require
the
use
of
community-developed
metadata
standards
formal

for

fair
vocabularies
and
qualified
references
to
other

these
principles
are
unfortunately
not
yet
widely
or
fully
implemented
across
biomedical
data
systems
making
it
difficult
for
systems
to
develop
functions
that
integrate
data
semantically
to
illustrate
this
we
examine
our
own
experience
developing
the
glds
to
provide
federated
search
and
retrieval
of
omics
data
from
several
data
sources
we
sought
to
import
metadata
records
from
three
open-access
data
systems
into
our
own
metadata
warehouse
geo
mg-rast
and
the

repository
pride
each
of
these
systems
defines
metadata
for
omics
data
sets
differently
but
none
of
them
make
these
schemas
available
in
formal
semantic
language
format
such
as
rdf
or
owl
furthermore
there
are
no
existing
maps
of
any
of
the
metadata
schemas
to
each
other
as
such
we
resorted
to
manually
creating
semantic
maps
of
these
schemas
for
use
in
our
system
queries
generated
via
the
glds

its

are
executed
against
the
mapped

and
matching

are
shown
in

model
representation
figure
while
this
approach
met
our
immediate
goals
of
allowing
users
to
query
several
data
sources
using
our
system
it
required
good
deal
of
resources
and
domain
expertise
to
develop
schema
mapping
furthermore
maintaining
this
mapping
over
time
as
each
of
the
data
sources
inevitably
change
will
require
more
of
our
limited
resources
the
research
community
should
recognize
the
value
of
federated
system
functions
like
the
querying
function
that
the
glds
offers
and
urge
all
open
access
repositories
and
data
systems
to
make
their
metadata
schemas
available
to
all
according
to
the
aforementioned
