introduction
among1
the
seven
key
requirements
to
achieve
trustworthy
ai
proposed
by
the
high-level
expert
group
on
artificial
intelligence
ai-hleg
established
by
the
european
commission
ec
the
fifth
requirement
diversity
non-discrimination
and
fairness
declares
in
order
to
achieve
trustworthy
ai
we
must
enable
inclusion
and
diversity
throughout
the
entire
ai
system
life
cycle
this
requirement
is
closely
linked
with
the
principle
of
fairness
chapter
section
1.5
ai-hleg
2019
hereafter
we
try
to
shed
light
on
how
closely
these
two
distinct
concepts
diversity
and
fairness
may
be
treated
by
focusing
on
information
access
systems
and
ranking
literature
these
concepts
should
not
be
used
interchangeably
because
they
do
represent
two
different
values
but
what
we
argue
is
that
they
also
cannot
be
considered
totally
unrelated
or
divergent
having
diversity
does
not
imply
fairness
but
fostering
diversity
can
effectively
lead
to
fair
outcomes
an
intuition
behind
several
methods
proposed
to
mitigate
the
disparate
impact
of
information
access
systems
recommender
systems
and
search
engines
10
links
between
fairness
and
diversity
the
first
link
can
be
found
between
the
concepts
of
group
fairness
and
egalitarian
diversity
11
12
indeed
the
former
often
referred
to
as
demographic
or
statistical
parity
is
achieved
when
different
groups
with
regard
to
certain
demographics
receive
similar
treatments
to
maximise
egalitarian
diversity
hence
having
population
uniformly
distributed
among
different
groups
13
is
identical
to
enforcing
group
fairness
wherein
every
group
has
equal
representation
similar
treatment
this
idea
is
behind
the
use
of
diversity
constraints
while
intervening
in
the
outcome
of
an
automated
decision-making
system

fairness
relates
to
the
concept
of
coverage-based
diversity
an
aggregated
diversity
metric
often
used
in
recommender
systems
literature
indeed
such
metric
is
maximised
when
different
groups
of
items
are
represented
in
the
most
heterogeneous
way
second
both
fairness
and
diversity
relate
to
the
treatment
of
and
consequently
the
impact
on
protected
disadvantaged
minority
groups
or
classes
the
definition
of
protected
class
is
usually
dependent
upon
laws
and
policies
which
may
vary
between
countries
aiming
at
preventing
any
form
of
discrimination
towards
such
classes
for
instance
the
eu
charter
of
fundamental
rights
states
that
any
discrimination
based
on
any
ground
such
as
sex
race
colour
ethnic
or
social
origin
genetic
features
language
religion
or
belief
political
or
any
other
opinion
membership
of
national
minority
property
birth
disability
age
or
sexual
orientation
shall
be

as
argued
by
castillo
ensuring
fairness
can
be
seen
as
emphasising
not
the
presence
of
various
groups
but
ensuring
that
those
in
protected
groups
are
effectively
included
under
this
lens
it
is
evident
that
the
construction
of
group
diverse
in
egalitarian
terms
may
not
result
in
fair
representation
if
disadvantaged
classes
are
not
effectively
included
however
if
we
consider
the
exposure
diversity
with
adversarial
perspective
as
defined
by
helberger
15
it
explicitly
aims
at
promoting
exposure
to
critical
voices
and
disadvantaged
views
that
otherwise
might
be
silenced
in
the
public
debate
if
defined
as
above
we
notice
that
both
fairness
and
diversity
stress
the
importance
of
targeting
representation
that
is
not
only
equal
in
terms
of
distribution
but
also
that
may
give
exposure
to
historically
disadvantaged
groups
we
can
further
relate
these
concepts
with
the
idea
of
normative
diversity
13
indeed
if
we
imagine
scenario
where
the
non-diverse
norm
coincides
with
the
privileged
group
for
instance
the
stem
community
where
the
old-white-male
represents
the
stereotype
of
the
scientist
increasing
the
diversity
in
normative
sense
would
result
in
wider
inclusion
of
marginalised
voices
which
is
what
the
exposure
diversity
under
an
adversarial
perspective
would
target
differences
and
limitations
so
far
we
have
discussed
some
intersections
between
diversity
and
fairness
concepts
but
in
order
to
better
clarify
their
nature
it
is
useful
to
focus
also
on
the
differences
between
them
early
quantitative
definitions
of
both
values
have
been
proposed
several
decades
ago
but
in
their
rationale
we
note
substantial
difference
indeed
whilst
since
the
beginning
fairness
metrics
have
been
proposed
to
tackle
societal
issues
16
most
of
the
diversity
indexes
still
widely
used
have
been
proposed
in
disparate
fields
simpson
index
in
ecology
17
and
they
have
been
originally
formulated
to
measure
diversity
intended
as
heterogeneity
variety
or
entropy
shannon
index
18
even
if
this
does
not
undermine
their
use
in
measuring
diversity
it
is
also
true
that
their
application
needs
to
be
contextualised
for
supporting
the
validity
of
the
inferred
results
similarly
lack
of
value-oriented
approach
can
be
found
in
the
design
of
the
diversification
techniques
19
20
indeed
looking
at
the
early
proposals
of
the
information
retrieval
and
recommender
systems
communities
the
main
goal
for
diversifying
is
to
tackle
the
problem
of
ambiguity
of
query
or
the
redundancy
of
the
results
and
also
to
deal
with
uncertainty
great
advancements
have
been
made
in
this
direction
21
but
this
utility-oriented
definition
of
diversity
has
partly
created
ambiguity
over
the
concept
of
diversity
itself
at
least
in
the
communities
where
such
approaches
have
been
applied
conclusion
whilst
the
aforementioned
points
are
just
few
among
the
several
aspects
that
link
diversity
and
fairness
we
conclude
by
stressing
their
relevance
in
recent
policies
proposed
in
the
european
context
the
digital
service
act
dsa
22
mandates
that
digital
services
powered
by
technologies
such
as
recommender
systems
and
search
engines
should
be
monitored
to
guarantee
the
avoidance
of
unfair
or
arbitrary
outcomes
under
different
lens
the
artificial
intelligence
act
ai
act
proposal
23
also
refers
to
the
need
for
bias
monitoring
as
part
of
the
mandatory
requirements
for
high-risk
ai
systems
moreover
in
terms
of
diversity
the
ai
act
explicitly
states
that
providers
of
ai
systems
should
be
encouraged
to
create
code
of
conduct
covering
aspects
such
as
accessibility
stakeholders
participation
and
ensuring
diversity
of
development
teams
these
two
goals
considered
above
system-centric
ensuring
bias
and
fairness
in
algorithmic
systems
and
people-centric
view
ensuring
diversity
of
persons
involved
in
the
ai
design
process
are
strongly
related
only
fostering
the
diversity
of
development
teams
and
therefore
embedding
different
perspectives
could
lead
to
future
where
information
access
systems
act
in
trustworthy
and
fair
way
