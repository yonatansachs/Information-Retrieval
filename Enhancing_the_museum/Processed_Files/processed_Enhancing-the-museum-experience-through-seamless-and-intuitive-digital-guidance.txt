περιληψη
τις
τελευταίες
δεκαετίες
τεχνολογία
έχει
δημιουργήσει
μια
κουλτούρα
άμεσης
ικανοποίησης
σε
βαθμό
που
πρόσβαση
σε
πληροφορίες
και
ψυχαγωγία
αναμένεται
να
είναι
στιγμιαία
επιθυμία
για
γρήγορη
κατανάλωση
περιεχομένου
αποτυπώνεται
στο
γεγονός
ότι
κόσμος
επιλέγει
πιο
εντυπωσιακές
και
ταχύρρυθμες
δραστηριότητες
για
το
λόγο
αυτό
τα
μουσεία
και
λοιπά
πολιτιστικά
ιδρύματα
χρειάστηκε
να
προσαρμοστούν
ώστε
να
εκπαιδεύσουν
και
να
κινήσουν
το
ενδιαφέρον
των
επισκεπτών
τους
απόκτηση
ψηφιακών
οδηγών
και
διαδραστικών
τεχνολογιών
τους
επιτρέπει
να
ικανοποιούν
τις
ανάγκες
του
σύγχρονου
κοινού
τους
και
τις
προσδοκίες
τους
για
άμεση
και
εύκολη
πρόσβαση
στη
πληροφορία
αυτό
συνεπάγεται
το
ρίσκο
να
αποκλειστούν
επισκέπτες
με
αναπηρίες
με
περιορισμένη
έκθεση
σε
αντίστοιχες
τεχνολογίες
σκοπός
της
παρούσας
είναι
να
εξεταστεί
σχεδιασμός
μιας
ψηφιακής
εφαρμογής
μουσειακού
οδηγού
που
μειώνει
τις
αποσπάσεις
και
τον
χρόνο
που
απαιτείται
χρήση
της
οθόνης
για
μη
ενημερωτικούς
λόγους
με
τον
τρόπο
αυτό
επιτρέπει
στους
επισκέπτες
να
αλληλεπιδράσουν
και
να
εκτιμήσουν
τα
εκθέματα
του
μουσείου
στο
έπακρο
απλοποιώντας
την
εφαρμογή
και
ενσωματώνοντας
κινήσεις
εύκολες
στη
χρήση
παρούσα
πτυχιακή

να
