abstract
introduction
rankings
are
the
primary
interface
through
which
many
online
we
consider
the
problem
of
dynamic
learning-to-rank
ltr
where
platforms
match
users
to
items
news
products
music
video
the
ranking
function
dynamically
adapts
based
on
the
feedback
in
these
two-sided
markets
not
only
the
users
draw
utility
from
that
users
provide
such
dynamic
ltr
problems
are
ubiquitous
in
the
rankings
but
the
rankings
also
determine
the
utility
ex
online
systems
news-feed
rankings
that
adapt
to
the
number
of
posure

for
the

can
be

learning

are

that

there
are
at
least
two
issues
that
require
careful
fairness
while
simultaneously
learning
the
ranking
function
from

considerations
first
the
ranking
system
induces
bias
implicit

the
algorithm
takes
the
form
of

the
rankings

presents

and

are
more
likely
to
collect
additional
feedback
which
in
turn
can
namically
adapting
both
as
more
data
becomes
available
in
addition
influence
future
rankings
and
promote
misleading

to
its
rigorous
theoretical
foundation
and
convergence

second
the
ranking
system
is
the
arbiter
we
find
empirically
that
the
algorithm
is
highly
practical
and
robust
of
how
much
exposure
each
item
receives
where
exposure
directly
influences
opinion

orientation

or

systems
learning

about
how

should
be
allocated

on
the
merit
of
the
keywords

that
