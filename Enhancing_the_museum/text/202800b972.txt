Abstract— Immersive virtual environments represent a 
great opportunity for museums to enhance visitor experience 
through edutainment. However, to provide an enjoyable 
entertainment and learning experience for all visitors, including 
people with disabilities, the virtual museum must not only be 
accessible, but also inclusive: they must provide greater equality 
and cultural and learning opportunities for all social groups. To 
achieve this goal, the concept of Universal Design needs to evolve 
into a user-centered approach where people are involved in co-
designing the virtual museum experience. In this context, the 
article describes a pilot study conducted at the University of 
Macerata, which explores the possibility of using high-fidelity 
prototyping in a virtual laboratory to support the co-creation of 
an immersive virtual museum environment with relevant target 
users, including children and people with disability, from the 
earliest design stages. The paper presents the results of the co-
design process and discusses its implications in defining design 
requirements to ensure the accessibility of immersive solutions 
for cultural heritage.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In the last three decades, the emergence of what has been 
called "new museology" [1] and the need to cope with 
increasing competition in the so-called "experience economy" 
[2] have led museum institutions to gradually, but radically, 
transform their relations with society and communities: from 
institutions focused on the preservation and research of 
collections, they are gradually and partially evolving into 
spaces of participation and co-creation of cultural messages 
[3, 4]. Museums must not only fulfill their educational 
mission, but also provide engaging and remarkable 
experiences to attract as many visitors as possible, better meet 
their needs and expectations, and increase their willingness to 
revisit and recommend, thereby growing audiences and 
increasing ticket sales and museum sustainability [5]. In other 
words, today's museums must enhance the visitor experience 
through 
edutainment 
(education 
and 
entertainment), 
providing an authentic and memorable experience with 
artifacts.  
In this context, new eXtended Reality (XR) technologies 
represent crucial tools for the promotion of exhibitions, 
drastically changing the way they are conceived and 
organized, and reach audiences. Immersive virtual reality 
(VR) is playing an increasingly important role, as it allows 
visitors to perceive virtual images of artifacts as authentic and 
to obtain information about the collections in an entertaining 
way [4]. In addition, it can improve museum accessibility by 
allowing visitors to access inaccessible locations or objects 
[6]. Numerous museums (e.g., British Museum, the Prado 
Museum, the Vatican Museum) have adopted VR to provide 
spectacular experiences for their visitors.  
Based on the results of a recent study [3], immersive VR 
with Head Mounted Display (HMD) seems to be the 
technology of choice to maximize visitor interest and 
satisfaction (especially young people) and create memorable 
museum experiences that maximize Pine & Gilmore's 4Es 
(i.e., education, entertainment, escapism, esthetics) [2]. 
However, to ensure enjoyable edutainment experiences virtual 
museums must be inclusive. This requires the design of virtual 
environments in order to meet as many visitor requirements as 
possible, including those with disabilities. To this end, several 
research try to address this issue, starting from the application 
of accessibility guidelines, e.g., WCAG 2.1 [7], or proposing 
specific methods and tools to ensure accessibility for people 
with disabilities (e.g., low vision [8], learning disabilities [9], 
intellectual disabilities [10], autism [11]). Nevertheless, 
museum inclusiveness does not depend only on physical 
accessibility aspects, but also to the peculiarities of its users 
[12, 13], so that to ensure virtual museum inclusiveness is a 
rather difficult and complex task that must consider many 
aspects. The challenge facing is to provide greater equality 
and cultural and learning opportunities for all social groups, 
from an inclusion perspective that aims to respond to the 
complexity of society [14, 15].  
To achieve this goal, the concept of Universal Design 
(UD) [16] needs to evolve into a user-centered approach 
where people can participate in designing an entertainment 
and learning environment that simply meets their needs and 
expectations so that they can use it efficiently [17]. Design 
methods and processes are crucial for the effective 
development of VR, to ensure inclusive virtual museum 
experiences, and deserve further studies [18]. However, 
research appears to agree that user-centered design (UCD) is

the preferred approach for developing immersive solutions for 
cultural heritage [19], as this approach also underlies design 
for user empowerment [20]. So that, there is a call for more 
studies to improve user-centered design practices, to ensure 
that the virtual experiences are designed and developed upon 
a full understanding of the needs, expectations and 
requirements of visitors [18, 21]. 
In this context, this research aims at exploiting the 
possibility of using high-fidelity prototyping, within a virtual 
lab, to enable co-design activities with people with disabilities 
useful to support design requirement definition, to ensure the 
accessibility of immersive solutions for cultural heritage. The 
paper describes a pilot study carried out at the University of 
Macerata to support the co-creation of an immersive virtual 
museum environment with relevant target users, including 
children and people with disabilities. 
II. RESEARCH BACKGROUND 
A. Accessibility criteria for an inclusive virtual museum 
In general, accessibility issues that may arise in physical 
museums overlap with those in the virtual museum. To be 
considered inclusive, a museum must meet accessibility 
requirements: it must ensure that access to its environments 
and content is barrier-free [7]. Such barriers may be present at 
the spatial, sensory, or intellectual level (e.g., uneven paths, 
mono-sensory information, excessive complexity of language 
used in descriptions). Over the years, several guidelines have 
been developed, which provide several criteria about how to 
improve museum access for people with learning disabilities 
and intellectual disabilities. Based on a recent review, the 
main guidelines currently available (i.e., [22], [23], [24], [25]) 
manly provide criteria that can be clustered into three 
categories [26]: Orientation and Guidance, addresses the 
design and presentation of the exhibit and the need for a 
guidance system; Exhibits, concerns exhibits feature 
and  presentation; Content, provides information about how 
the text can be presented to the target audience to promote 
better understanding. Most of them can be directly applied 
also for the construction of virtual museums. However, coping 
with these criteria does not ensure immersive virtual museum 
accessibility. In fact, although immersive VR offers new 
opportunities to include people with disabilities and make 
museums more accessible, it also presents some problems. For 
example, interaction in immersive VR, mainly based on head 
movement and the use of a controller for each hand, requires 
more physical dexterity than regular controllers or keyboards 
[27], and can be a huge barrier for people with motor 
disabilities. Using HMD can be impossible not only for blind 
people, but also for visually impaired people with unequal 
vision in one eye or stereo blindness [28], given that it is 
usually impossible to wear glasses under the HMD. Moreover, 
moving 
within 
the 
virtual 
environment 
can 
cause 
cybersickness and disorientation [29]. This requires affording 
further accessibility criteria. 
As far as we know, there are no specific guidelines for 
improving the accessibility of immersive virtual museums. 
Notwithstanding, a recent study [30] provides a review of 
accessibility guidelines available for immersive VR games, 
which can be applied to ensure the accessibility of any VR 
application. They mainly refer to two sources: XR 
Accessibility User Requirements [27], published by APA 
Working Group of W3C, and the Oculus VRCs “Accessibility 
Requirements” [31], which provides recommendations to 
make Oculus VR apps more accessible. 
B. Methods to support the design of inclusive museum 
Design methods and processes are crucial for the effective 
development of VR, to ensure inclusive virtual museum 
experiences, and deserve further studies [18]. However, 
several researches [18, 19, 32, 33] agree that UCD represents 
the approach of choice for the development of immersive 
solutions in line with the principles of UD [34], to mediate and 
support cultural heritage experiences, so as to empower users 
[20]. 
Based on standard ISO 9241-210:2010, a proper UCD 
process is characterized by the following 4 iterative steps [35]: 
a) identification of users’ needs and establishment of 
requirements for design; b) development of alternative 
solutions to meet such needs; c) building of interactive 
prototypes which can be communicated and assessed; d) 
evaluation of what is being built throughout the process and 
of the user experience it offers. Over the years, several 
methods have been proposed to support UCD practices to 
better consider the dynamic nature of users abilities [36]. For 
example, User Sensitive Inclusive Design [37] and Ability-
based Design [38] have been introduced in the context of ICT 
products to support the design team in developing empathy for 
people with disabilities and promote the development of 
adaptable interfaces based on user needs. However, there is 
still a call for more studies to improve user-centered design 
practices, to ensure that the virtual experiences are designed 
and developed upon a full understanding of the needs, 
expectations, and requirements of museum visitors [18, 21]. 
Co-design approaches seem to be fundamental to integrate 
multiple perspectives related to lived experiences, which is 
extremely important when designing with people with 
different abilities [39]. However, traditional techniques have 
problems related to the difficulty of communication with 
people with disabilities, who are often approached through 
“proxy” people (e.g., parents, teachers, caregivers), with 
consequent unequal power relations related issues [40]. 
III. PILOT STUDY 
This study was conducted with the aim of exploring the 
use of virtual prototyping in the co-design of an immersive 
and inclusive virtual museum environment with people with 
specific learning disorders and mild intellectual disability. Co-
design activities were carried out according to the method 
described below. 
A. The proposed method 
The proposed method is characterized by two phases: 
a) Construction of an adaptable and immersive virtual 
co-design 
environment. 
This 
phase 
involved 
a 
multidisciplinary design team, including experts in: UX 
design, special pedagogy and Easy-to-Read language, virtual 
reality application design, art history, learning disabilities and 
intellectual disabilities. The design activities were carried out 
iteratively, with the goal of developing an initial concept of 
an immersive virtual museum environment that complies 
with the accessibility guidelines shown in Table 1. This 
environment represents the starting concept that was used to 
conduct subsequent co-design activities with end users. The 
virtual environment used for the research was developed in 
Unity 3D (https://unity.com/). It consists of a floor plan 
1973

including several rooms,  decorated with polychrome marble 
and Ionic-style columns, through which an exhibition of 
archeological findings takes place.  
The asset used for the findings are digital copies of finds, 
part of the collections of the National Archaeological Museum 
of Sannio Caudino in Benevento and the Archaeological 
Museum of Carife in the province of Avellino, realized using 
a high-fidelity 3D color scanner (i.e., EinScan Color Pack 
[41]). 
The environment is completed by some monitors and 
posters used to provide multimodal information of the 
exhibit. The starting adaptable features include:  
x 
Adjustment of environment light exposure and color 
temperature (Figure 1); 
x 
Adjustment of the focus level, through the setting of 
vignetting effects (Figure 2), which allow the width 
of the field of view to be narrowed; 
x 
Possibility to choose between different museum 
guide modalities: text descriptions with highly 
readable fonts (i.e., OpenDyslexic) or audio / video 
guide that repeats slavishly the text of the 
description, which can be turned on/off by the user 
through a dedicated button (Figure 3). 
x 
Possibility to navigate the environment with mouse 
and keyboard, with a gamepad or by teleporting to 
the location and then exploring the surrounding 
space within a range of 2 meters, with natural 
movements (i.e., walking).

b) Iterative co-design and testing sessions: Co-design 
activities have been carried out at the virtual laboratory of the 
Research center of Teaching and learning, Inclusion, 
Disability, and Educational Technology (TIncTEC) of 
University of Macerata. They lasted three days, and involved 
a total of 30 people: 10 children (5 aged 6-10, 5 aged 11-13), 
5 teenagers aged 14-19, 15 adults (5 aged 20-25, 5 aged 30-
39, 5 aged 40-59). At least 2 people with disabilities were 
included for each age group, including: specific learning 
disorders, 
intellectual 
disability, 
Attention-
Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder, 
high-functional 
autism 
(HFA) and physical disability. Participants were divided into 
six groups of equal size (5 subjects each) and similar people 
characteristics. Each group took part in co-design activities in 
consecutive design iteration stages, so that their design 
contributions have been used to improve the design solution 
following an incremental process. 
Each group, one user at a time, has been asked to interact 
with the environment. During the interaction, they were 
encouraged to describe their experience with the virtual 
museum environment through semi-structured interviews 
designed to assess the users' opinion about the features, so as 
to highlight its strengths and limitations.

The tool used to allow navigation within virtual reality 
consists of a headset Oculus Quest 2 [42] equipped with two 
multifunction controllers. The headset is connected to a PC 
workstation running the Unity application in the “game view” 
modality using a usb cable. This enables environment co-
design, through the possibility of implementing some 
environment design adjustment in very short time (in the order 
of a few minutes). The subjective view of the environment 
visualized by the user through the headset is simultaneously 
shown on a large screen inside the laboratory room that allows 
the co-design team to monitor the activity of the users during 
the immersive experience and at the same time acts as a video 
source to be screen-captured, to record a video of the user 
interaction with the environment. Based on the results of each 
co-design session, the virtual museum features are updated as 
difficulties of use are encountered, in order to achieve the 
greatest possible accessibility and user experience. 
B. Results 
Six versions of the software have been developed. Table II 
shows the main features (on the row) implemented by the 
various versions of the virtual museum software application

During the preliminary steps of co-design with people with 
intellectual disabilities, it was necessary to modify and 
implement the interaction interfaces created into the virtual 
environment to increase both usability and interactivity. As a 
result, the second version included the possibility to control 
movement within the virtual environment even by mouse and 
keyboard. Moreover, to reduce cognitive load, the exhibition 
path was reduced as well, so that the user can explore one 
room at a time (in the first version the exhibition route takes 
place along three rooms). 
In the third revision, improvements were made to the 
decoration elements of the environment   (e.g., the reflectivity 
of the floor was reduced, to better simulate a marble covering). 
In addition, starting and stopping audio descriptions based on 
the user's proximity to the artifact that is the subject of the 
audio description was incorporated. 
This feature was later dropped in the fourth version, in 
favor of a start and stop control that requires user input (i.e., 
pushing a highly visible red button located near the exhibit). 
The possibility to choose between several fonts in addition to 
the OpenDyslexic was also added (i.e., the serif font Times 
New Roman and a sans-serif font Arial). 
 
FIGURE 4. THE THIRD PROTOTYPE VERSION. 
The 
fifth 
revision 
of 
the 
software 
introduced 
improvements related to the placement of artifacts within the 
virtual environment, and in the sixth revision, keyboard 
navigability was enriched by displaying an explanatory 
legend. In addition, the ability to navigate the environment by 
means of a gamepad was added. 
 
FIGURE 4. THE SEVENTH PROTOTYPE VERSION. 
Finally, to further reduce cognitive load,  facilitating an 
overall view of the exhibition, in the seventh and final revision 
(Figure 6) the architectural appearance of the room was 
changed: the columns originally arranged to delimit the room 
in three sections were placed as decoration on the walls.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In recent years a number of studies have been conducted 
on the use of immersive technologies in museum education, 
demonstrating how virtual reality can increase multisensory 
engagement and enhance the visitor experience within 
museums [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although the potential of 
immersive technologies has not been fully explored, they 
could be considered a valuable tool for creating inclusive 
educational experiences aimed at fostering the teaching-
learning process of cultural heritage  [47]. In this regard, the 
following research aims at the realization of a virtual museum 
developed with the Unity 3D graphics engine that includes 
high definition digital copies of real archaeological finds. A 
pilot study was conducted involving children and people with 
disabilities in the co-design of the virtual environment, in 
order to ensure an accessible and inclusive virtual museum 
experience. Future research perspectives will be aimed at 
investigating other possible configurations in the co-design 
process that could be effective in creating an inclusive 
environment during the museum experience. However, the 
results of this study may have a broader impact, as it provides 
new insights and guidelines for improving the accessibility of 
immersive virtual environments, with the goal of enabling 
people, to the maximum extent possible, to visit cities and 
natural environments otherwise inaccessible to most people 
(e.g., underwater depths, mountaintops), so as to enhance the 
accessibility of video games exploiting immersive VR. Future 
studies should be conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the 
proposed co-design process in supporting the development of 
accessible virtual environments in other application contexts.
