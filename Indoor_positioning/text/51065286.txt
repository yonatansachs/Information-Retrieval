Conclusion
VI.
This paper introduces CAPTURE a cooperative
localization system that provides a solution to the problem of
devices being out of range of a hosted Indoor Positioning
System. Experiments with the CAPTURE system have
demonstratedthatutilizingacooperativeframeworkofmobile
devices can extend the range of an in situ Indoor Positioning
System by at least the range of the outermost devices located
withinthesystem.
Some issues arose during testing for example the 0-10
meter readings, and this necessitates further work. A more
comprehensive algorithm would provide more accuracy for
the system. An expansion of CAPTURE to avail of Bluetooth
