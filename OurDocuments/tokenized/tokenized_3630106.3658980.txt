funds
number
of
services
that
play
major
role
in
our
everyday
online
experiences
from
social
networking
to
maps
search
and
news
as
the
power
and
reach
of
advertising
platforms
grow
so
do
the
concerns
about
the
potential
for
discrim
ination
associated
with
targeted
advertising
however
despite
our
ever-improving
ability
to
measure
and
describe
instances
of
unfair
distribution
of
high-stakes
ads-such
as
employment
housing
or
credit-we
lack
the
tools
to
model
and
predict
the
extent
to
which
alternative
systems
could
address
such
problems
in
this
paper
we
simulate
an
ad
distribution
system
to
model
the
effects
that
en
forcing
popularly
proposed
fairness
approaches
would
have
on
the
utility
of
the
advertising
platforms
and
their
users
we
show
that
in
many
realistic
scenarios
achieving
statistical
parity
would
come
at
much
higher
utility
cost
to
platforms
than
enforcing
predic
tive
parity
or
equality
of
opportunity
additionally
we
identify
tradeoff
between
different
notions
of
fairness
enforcing
one
criterion
leads
to
worse
outcomes
with
respect
to
other
criteria
we
further
describe
how
pursuing
fairness
in
situations
where
one
group
of
users
is
more
expensive
to
advertise
to
is
likely
to
result
in
leveling
down
effects
not
benefiting
any
group
of
users
we
show
that
these
negative
effects
can
be
prevented
by
ensuring
that
it
is
the
platforms
that
carry
the
cost
of
fairness
rather
than
passing
it
on
to
their
users
or
advertisers
overall
our
findings
contribute
to
ongoing
discussions
on
fair
ad
delivery
we
show
that
fairness
is
not
satisfied
by
default
that
limiting
targeting
options
is
not
sufficient
to
address
potential
discrimination
and
bias
in
online
ad
delivery
and
that
choices
made
by
regulators
and
platforms
may
backfire
if
potential
side-effects

introduction
advertising
is
the
backbone
of
variety
of
online
services
par
ticularly
those
available
to
users
for
free
websites
and
apps
fund
their
existence
by
offering
screen
space
to
parties
that
leverage
vast
amounts
of
data
to
present
the
most
profitable
ads
for
each
given
user
search
engines
such
as
google
and
bing
as
well
as
social
network
platforms
such
as
meta
and
formerly
known
as
face
book
inc
and
twitter
respectively
have
grown
to
control
much
of
this
process
by
owning
the
screen
real
estate
data
collection
and
ad
matching
processes
this
accumulation
of
personal
data
has
obvious
implications
for
privacy
as
well
as
trust
and
safety
the
functionality
built
atop
this
rich
data
especially
with
respect
to
detailed
ad
targeting
can
be
used
by
malicious
actors
for
example
advertisers
may
choose
to
target
their
ads
in
discriminatory
ways
for
example
by
prohibiting
older
users
from
seeing
job
ads
or
non-white
users
from
seeing
housing
opportunities
limiting
the
targeting
options
does
not
fully
mitigate
the
po
tential
for
discriminatory
effects
in
advertising
harmful
effects
may
stem
from
the
process
of
optimizing
ad
delivery
even
for
non
malicious
advertisers
ads
appearing
in
google
search
are
more
likely
to
suggest
criminal
history
when
users
search
for
individ
uals
with
black-sounding
names
even
if
those
individuals
have
no
such
history
32
43
women
may
see
fewer
opportunity
ads
especially
if
the
advertisers
operate
on
smaller
budgets
because
of
the
so-called
competitive
spillover
effects
31
similarly
the
higher
costs
of
running
informative
online
ads
for
snap
short
for
the
supplemental
nutrition
assistance
program
which
provides
food
benefits
to
low-income
families
targeting
spanish
speakers
com
pared
to
english
speakers
mean
that
allocating
funds
to
reach
spanish-speaking
audiences
reduces
the
overall
number
of
individ
uals
who
can
be
informed
and
enrolled
in
the
program
30
even
with
appropriate
budgets
meta
may
deliver
different
job
and
hous
ing
opportunities
based
on
the
gender
and
race
of
the

pursuit
of
maximizing
relevance
all
these
phenomena
translate
both
to
individual
and
societal
harms
those
who
are
not
presented
with
opportunities
within
particular
field
are
less
likely
to
seek
employment
there
and
even
if
they
do
apply
they
are
less
likely
to
be
hired
if
the
employers
see
an
indication
of
criminal
history
while
searching
for
their
names
the
problem
of
unfair
ad
delivery
has
been
recognized
in
both
the
united
states
and
the
european
union
meta
has
been
forced
to
address
biases
in
housing
ad
delivery
as
part
of
settlement
with
the
department
of
justice
47
with
the
advent
of
the
digital
services
act
dsa
in
the
eu
online
platforms
will
need
to
increase
the
transparency
of
online
advertising
and
will
be
subject
to
third-party
audits
for
algorithmic
biases
additionally
the
digital
markets
act
dma
is
already
in
effect
with
initial
investigations
into
non-compliance
by
designated
gatekeepers
underway
20
and
the
recently
enacted
ai
act
classifies
ai
systems
to
place
targeted
job
advertisements
as
high-risk
21
425
furthermore
studies
such
as
that
by
koenecke
et
al
30
suggest
that
there
is
broad
public
support
for
prioritizing
fairness
over
efficiency
in
ad
delivery
indicating
societal
shift
towards
valuing
equity
in
online
advertising
practices
despite
the
growing
awareness
of
the
discriminatory
effects
of
online
advertising
and
building
consensus
on
the
need
to
address
it
there
is
much
less
agreement
on
what
an
unbiased
system
would
look
like
and
how
exactly
it
should
be
implemented
the
settle
ment
between
meta
and
the
department
of
justice
establishes
fair
system
as
one
that
achieves
statistical
parity
such
that
the
distribution
of
gender
age
and
race
among
the
users
who
were
shown
an
ad
the
actual
audience
closely
resembles
the
de
mographic
distribution
of
the
users
in
the
targeted
audience
who
were
active
on
the
platform
during
the
lifetime
of
that
ad
the
eligible
audience
however
while
meta
has
claimed
it
now
adheres
to
statistical
parity
they
do
not
provide
enough
information
to
the
external
auditors
to
actually
verify
this
24
furthermore
this
approach
is
only
one
of
possible
views
of
fairness
and
others
have
been
proposed
35
49
importantly
if
there
are
population-level
differences
in
interests
qualifications
or
propensity
to
click
on
advertising
enforcing
multiple
fairness
definitions
at
the
same
time
may
be
mathematically
impossible
29
the
lack
of
transparency
surrounding
online
advertising
plat
forms
makes
selecting
appropriate
measures
even
more
difficult
researchers
have
tried
investigating
user
experiences
through

17
as

as
studying
spillover

31
and

41
by

and
leveraging
the

reporting

un
fortunately
such
approaches
do
not
allow
us
to
understand
the
implications
of
alternative
solutions
to
this
end
several
previous
papers
focused
on

the
core
underlying

our
contributions
conducting
real-world
studies
to
evaluate
the
impact
of
fairness
enhancing
interventions
on
online
ad
delivery
system
presents
significant
challenges
as
outside
researchers
cannot
directly
ex
periment
with
the
platforms
advertising
algorithms
while
experi
mental
evaluations
of
unfairness
in
ad
delivery
systems
are
suited
to
detect
platform-specific
problems
they
are
limited
in
scope
in
this
work
we
use
simulations
to
observe
general
trends
regarding
the
utility
for
advertising
platforms
and
their
users
under
vari
ous
popularly
proposed
fairness
approaches
simulations
are
the
only
method
to
measure
counterfactual
outcomes-such
as
whether
someone
would
have
clicked
on
an
ad
had
they
seen
it-and
to
control
and
manipulate
various
factors
including
platform
utility
user
benefits
associated
with
an
ad
impression
and
group-level
differences
in
ad
clicking
probabilities
this
approach
enables
us
to
abstract
away
the
effects
of
the
ad
content
and
advertiser
account
properties
which
is
impossible
in
experiments
that
involve
run
ning
particular
ads
on
specific
accounts
and
to
test
broad
range
of
reasonable
parameter
values
and
combinations
our
findings
demonstrate
that
discriminatory
effects
persist
and
are
not
merely
artifacts
of
how
platforms
manage
specific
ads
or
accounts
in
this
paper
we
conduct
simulation
study
to
explore
the
impact
of
enforcing
different
fairness
notions
in
the
context
of
high-stakes
online
ad
delivery
our
results
are
predicated
on
minimal
assump
tions
that
accurately
reflect
real-world
advertising
systems
and
include
sensitivity
analysis
consequently
the
following
find
ings
are
expected
to
hold
generally
for
different
online
advertising
algorithms
even
when
abstracting
away
the
auction
process
the
delivery
of
opportunity
ads
on
online
platforms
is
inherently
unfair
this
is
attributed
to
the
platforms
efficiency-driven
operations
aimed
at
maximizing
their
utility
limiting
the
targeting
options
for
advertisers
does
not
ensure
equitable
online
advertising
using
personalized
ml-based
predictions
the
resulting
ad
impressions
can
still
be
unfair
for
certain
demographic
groups
enforcing
fairness
often
reduces
platform
utility
specif
ically
we
demonstrate
that
achieving
predictive
parity
or
equality
of
opportunity
generally
incurs
lower
utility
cost
for
platforms
than
achieving
statistical
parity
tradeoffs
exist
between
different
notions
of
fairness
en
forcing
specific
fairness
criterion
can
inadvertently
worsen
outcomes
concerning
other
criteria
enforcing
fairness
can
result
in
potentially
undesirable
side-effects
for
example
we
find
that
leveling
down
sce
narios
occur
in
the
presence
of
large
spillover
effects
negative
effects
can
be
prevented
we
show
that
it
is
cru
cial
to
ensure
that
the
platforms
carry
the
cost
of
fairness
interventions
instead
of
passing
it
on
to
end-users
and
adver
tisers
in
order
to
limit
the
undesirable
side-effects
our
research
offers
valuable
implications
for
the

background
and
related
work
this
paper
draws
on
research
in
online
ad
auction
design
and
algorithmic
fairness
below
we
introduce
the
important
aspects
of
both
of
these
streams
of
inquiry
2.1
ad
auctions
and
auto-bidding
there
is
complex
ecosystem
around
matching
available
ads
to
the
individuals
among
the
targeted
audience
who
ultimately
see
them
this
matching
process
is
backed
by
expansive
data
collection
that
allows
both
for
fine-grained
segmentation
of
audiences
and
for
immediate
feedback
on
each
ad
performance
whenever
user
sees
an
ad
on
website
they
witness
result
of
an
elaborate
process
involving
multiple
parties
first
the
publisher
the
entity
that
controls
the
ad
space
announces
to
supply-side
platform
ssp
that
an
ad
slot
is
available
to
be
shown
to
user
identified
with
cookie
the
ssp
may
combine
the
cookie
with
all
their
other
infor
mation
about
that
user
behaviors
demographics
etc
and
share
it
with
an
ad
exchange
the
ad
exchange
hosts
an
ad
auction
where
de
mand
side
platforms
dsps
acting
on
behalf
of
advertisers
choose
whether
and
how
much
to
bid
for
the
opportunity
to
show
their
ad
the
dsp
who
places
the
winning
bid
gets
to
present
their
ad
to
the
user
the
advertiser
is
charged
per
thousand
impressions
cost
per
mille
or
cpm
or
only
whenever
the
user
actually
clicks
on
the
ad
cost
per
click
or
cpc
in
the
latter
scenario
the
dsp
is
particularly
motivated
to
bid
in
auctions
where
they
estimate
the
user
will
find
the
ad
relevant
the
entire
process
happens
programmatically
in
real-time
and
appears
seamless
to
the
user
more
recently
major
online
platforms
such
as
meta
or
google
have
been
taking
over
the
roles
of
both
ssps
and
dpss
rather
than
relying
on
showing
ads
on
third-party
webpages
through
ssps
these
platforms
can
show
ads
within
their
own
products
they
also
hold
the
auctions
themselves
eliminating
the
need
for
third-party
ad
exchanges
finally
they
replaced
much
of
what
dsps
would
offer
with
auto-bidding
in
the
auto-bidding
scenario
the
adver
tiser
specifies
the
characteristics
of
their
target
audience
and
sets
the
budget
the
advertiser
also
selects
their
goal
maximiz
ing
impressions
clicks
or
conversions
the
platform
then
bids
on
the
advertiser
behalf
in
an
attempt
to
maximize
their
stated
goal
of
course
maximizing
that
goal
is
subject
to
the
constraint
of
si
multaneously
optimizing
the
platform
revenue
if
the
platform
overwhelms
the
user
with
ads
or
shows
ads
that
are
upsetting
or
even
uninteresting
the
user
might
stop
browsing
thus
reducing
the
number
of
future
ad
slots
therefore
the
platforms
aim
to
show
users
relevant
ads
this
motivation
is
enacted
through
an
important
change
to
the
auction
system
namely
the
platform
subsidizes
bids
from
ads
predicted
to
be
relevant
to
the
user
33
the
advertiser
actually
pays
less
to
show
their
ads
to
users
who
the
platforms
deem
well-matched
conversely
ads
predicted
to
have
less
relevance
to
the
particular
user
are
less
likely
to
win
an
auction
even
if
they
have
budgets
comparable
to
those
of
relevant
ads
2.2
fairness
and
discrimination
in
online
ads
at
first
glance
the
developments
in
auto-bidding
appear
to
benefit
all
stakeholders
they
lower
the
knowledge
barrier
to
entry
for
ad
vertisers
who
can
now
rely
on
the
platform
algorithms
to
optimize
the
matching
and
bidding
at
the
same
time
delivery
optimization
promises
better
user
experience
through
ads
that
are
more
likely
to
be
of
interest
unfortunately
certain
problems
become
appar
ent
when
looking
at
the
advertising
platforms
through
the
lens
of
fairness
first
the
advertiser
may
choose
targeting
criteria
that
are
discriminatory
by
excluding
individuals
of
particular
gender
or
age
from
seeing
the
ads
additionally
there
are
two
important
phenomena
that
can
lead
to
apparently
discriminatory
or
harmful
outcomes
without
the
advertiser
intent
competitive
spillovers
and
optimization
for
relevance
discriminatory
targeting
until
recently
advertisers
on
meta
could
choose
to
use
gender
age
and
ethnic
affinity
for
targeting
and
excluding
audiences
from
seeing
opportunity
advertising
following
2019
settlement
between
meta
and
number
of
civil
rights
organizations
46
these
criteria
have
been
removed
de
spite
that
malicious
advertiser
can
still
discriminate
by
targeting
interests
whose
distribution
is
skewed
between
genders
or
racial
groups
42
or
by
targeting
biased
custom
audience
41
impor
tantly
in
this
work
we
focus
on
situations
where
the
advertiser
selected
no
discriminatory
targeting
options
competitive
spillovers
are
rooted
in
the
auction
mechanism
imagine
there
are
two
advertisers
one
targeting
men
and
women
the
other
targeting
only
women
because
of
that
targeting
they
will
be
competing
in
the
ad
auctions
for
women
thus
raising
the
price
necessary
to
win
the
auction
as
consequence
if
the
advertiser
who
targets
men
and
women
uses
the
same
bids
for
both
they
are
more
likely
to
lose
auctions
for
impressions
to
women
and
end
up
showing
their
ad
predominantly
to
men
despite
inclusive
target
ing
31
one
possible
remedy
to
this
problem
is
for

to
maximize

both
for

and

predicted
to

however
mean
that
the

of

skewed
along

have
shown
that
despite
inclusive
targeting
the
job
ads
they
ran
were

to
skewed

mostly
to
black

offers
for
supermarket
cashiers
were
presented
disproportionately
to

the
effect
is
particularly
troubling
because
it
appears
to
replicate
stereotypes
even
if
the
qualifications
and
lack
thereof
to
perform
the
advertised
job
are
evenly
distributed
among
the

28
even
though
the
source
of
algorithmic

is
unrelated
to
the
competitive
spillovers
the
proposed
solutions
also
rely
on
modifying
the

strategy
in

fashion

in

corresponds
to
violation
of
the

criterion
called
statistical

that
statistical

can
be
violated
even
in

alternative
notions
of
fairness
which
are
based
on
the
actual
outcome
measuring
clicks
rather
than
impressions
have
been
proposed
49
for
example
predictive
parity
also
referred
to
as
ppv
positive
predictive
value
parity
10
is
closely
related
to
the
notion
of
calibration
for
the
case
of
continuous-valued
predicted
scores
18
in
the
context
of
serving
online
ads
with
binary
out
comes
and
decisions
system
satisfying
predictive
parity
would
indicate
that
the
click-through
rates
ctr
are
balanced
between
groups
proponents
of
this
solution
may
claim
it
reflects
the
un
derlying
interests
in
the
advertised
content
finally
equality
of
opportunity
also
referred
to
as
tpr-true
positive
rate-parity
requires
an
equal
share
of
user
groups
to
see
the
ads
among
all
those
who
would
click
on
the
ad
25
the
choice
of
particular
fairness
metric
is
crucial
since
it
is
mathematically
impossible
to
satisfy
all
parity
metrics
simultane
ously
apart
from
degenerate
cases
13
29
furthermore
friedler
et
al
22
show
that
there
is
trade-off
between
accuracy
and
fair
ness
although
this
trade-off
may
be
negligible
in
practice
when
equality
of
opportunity
is
the
metric
of
choice
39
finally
en
forcing
group
fairness
for
ad
impressions
on
online
platforms
may
lead
to
worse
outcomes
for
all
groups
26
this
leveling
down
objection
challenges
the
idea
of
egalitarianism
16
37
which
is
the
basis
for
most
group
fairness
criteria
discussed
in
the
fair
ml
literature
as
they
typically
aim
to
minimize
inequality
34
this
raises
the
question
of
whether
we
should
demand
equality
even
if
it
does
not
benefit
anyone
emphasizing
that
the
group-specific
utility
of
fairness-enhancing
techniques
must
be
evaluated

is
not
different

if
these

were
used

simple
online

in
this
section
we
introduce
model
to
simulate
the
delivery
of
ads
on
online
platforms
we
describe
the
overall
setup
and
introduce
in
this
context
the
term

used
to
refer
to
any
type
of

as

setup
and
notation
the
auction
mechanism
used
by
online
ad
platforms
is
complex
process
involving
many
factors
such
as
bid
price
ad
quality
and
relevance
however
online
platforms
place
bids
on
behalf
of
ad
vertisers
through
auto-bidding
in
auctions
whose
mechanism
they
design
and
control
and
can
thus
decide
which
users
see
which
ads
thus
we
may
abstract
away
the
underlying
auction
mechanism
and
model
the
platform
ad
delivery
problem
as
simple
binary
decision
problem
from
the
perspective
of
given
high-stakes
ad
for
all
ad
slots
where
the
high-stakes
ad
is
competitor
the
platform
must
decide
whether
or
not
to
show
it
this
allows
us
to
investigate
the
effect
of
introducing
different
fairness
constraints
to
the
ad
delivery
system
on
different
demographic
groups
the
decision
variable
is
denoted
by
where
indicates
showing
the
high-stakes
ad
and
indicates
showing
another
ad
after
being
shown
the
ad
user
either
clicks
on
it
or
not
the
revenue
for
the
given
high-stakes
ad
is
denoted
by
which
is
the
utility
gained
if
the
user
clicks
on
the
ad
the
advertiser
bid
amount
the
utility
gained
if
the
high-stakes
ad
is
not
shown
is
denoted
by
which
could
represent
the
expected
utility
of
the
best
other
ad
or
the
utility
gained
by
not
showing
any
ad
to
the
user
we
assume
that
advertisers
are
willing
to
pay
for
their
ads
to
be
shown
and
this
assumption
holds
as
long
as
there
are
other
ads
to
show
in
given
slot
or
if
there
is
non-paid
content
to
be
shown
instead
that
would
encourage
the
user
to
stay
on
the
platform
and
browse
to
the
next
ad
slot
the
platform
may
draw
utility
not
just
from
showing
an
ad
in
particular
ad
slot
but
also
from
the
downstream
effects
of
retaining
user
attention
by
showing
them
non-paid
piece
of
content
online
ad
platforms
often
refer
to
the
dis
utility
that
users
expe
rience
when
viewing
an
ad
as
the
ad
quality
though
they
do
not
estimate
ad
quality
on
user-specific
basis
which
is
why
it
can
be
modeled
by
simply
adding
constants
to
and
44
we
measure
what
we
call
the
user
utility
of
high-stakes
ad
as
the
number
of
individuals
that
get
to
see
the
ad
which
we
denote
by
this
allows
us
to
evaluate
the
benefits
and
harms
of
specific
inter
vention
which
may
be
desirable
from
societal
perspective
this
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
for
those
types
of
ads
users
benefit
solely
from
seeing
them
because
it
exposes
them
to
some
kind
of
opportunity
or
resource
furthermore
we
assume
that
the
online
platform
accurately
estimates
the
user
probability
of
clicking
on
the
ad
which
we
denote
by
advertisement
clicks
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
model
follows
cpc
model
but
the
outcome
represents
whether
user
takes
the
advertiser
desired
action
which
is
why
our
model
could
easily
be
generalized
to
other
business
objectives
representing
any
type
of
conversion
3this
formulation
resembles
vickrey-clarke-groves
auction
that
includes
organic
content
48
4we
consider
high-stakes
ads
to
be
those
for
which
seeing
them
is
clearly
desirable
such
as
employment
housing
or
financial
opportunities
or
undesirable
such
as
predatory
lending
services
19
45
hence
the
user
utility
could
easily
be
defined
as
disutility
if
high-stakes
ad
is
harmful
to
see
for
simplicity
we
consider
desirable
high-stakes
ads
that
provide
an
opportunity
in
the
remainder
of
this
paper
in
contrast
to
other
online

as

on

those

in

where
there
are

whatsoever
fairness
can
be

this
is
because
there

in

where
there

there
is
cost
in

to

even
though
the

of

are
the

however
since

any
type
of

also
ensures
all
other

of

the
cost
in
terms
of

is
the
same
for
any
type
of
fairness
in
contrast
to
the
reference
case
scenario
the
presence
of

spillovers
leads
to
women
having
higher

therefore

it-even
absent
any
discriminatory

mitigating
this

requires
counteracting
the
competitive

to
ensure
that
the

just

for

they

tradeoffs
between

enforcing

conflicts
with
others
by
definition
all
fairness
criteria
are
met
in
scenario
since
there
are
no
group-specific
differences
as
demonstrated
in
fig
2a
in
cases
where
there
is
no
difference
in
the
click
probability
distributions
between
the
two
groups
satisfying
any
type
of
fairness
ensures
all
other
types
of
fairness
at
no
additional
cost
the
different
fc
can
be
achieved
at
the
same
time
since
the
br
does
not
differ
across
groups
thus
for
scenario
enforcing
any
type
of
fairness
through
post-processing
produces
fairness
with
respect
to
all
metrics
for
scenario
in
addition
to
the
fairness-utility
tradeoff
there
are
tradeoffs
between
different
notions
of
fairness
due
to
the

the
rationale
for

effect
is
the
fact
that
with

spillovers
achieving

by

the

group
becomes
optimal
from
the
platform
perspective
resulting
in
situation
where
no
one
benefits
from
the
added
fc
to
avoid
leveling
down
we
reran
all
the
simulations
described
in
section
4.2
with
an
additional
constraint
of
fixed
total
number
of
high-stakes
ad

for
the

simula
tions
depending
on
the
number
of
users
who
would
get
to
see
the
high-stakes
ad
in
the
unconstrained
case
as
can
be
seen
in
fig
this
prevents
the
platform
from
achieving
equality
by
harming
the
better-off
group
and
ensures
that
the
burden
of
the
added
fc
is
on
the
platform
by
maintaining
constant
number
of
high-stakes
ad
impressions
we
can
ensure
that
the
added
fc
benefits
at
least
one
of
the
groups
in
this
case
ensuring
fairness
while
keeping
the
total
number
of
impressions
constant
increases
the
user
utility
for
women
and
decreases
the
utility
for
men
how
ever
preventing
the
platform
from
reducing
the
total
number
of
high-stakes
ad
impressions
comes
at
cost
in
terms
of
platform
utility
shifting
the
cost
of
fairness
from
the
users
to
the
platform
this
new
cost
in
terms
of
platform
utility
is
shown
in
fig
be
low
showing
that
adding
an
impression
constraint
shifts
the
cost
of
fairness
from
the
users
to
the
platform
consequently
it
leads
to
an
increase
in
the
cost
of
fairness
in
terms
of
the
platform
utility
relative
to
the
utility
derived
in
the
unconstrained
case
for
scenarios
and
however
the
increase
is
more
pronounced
for
the
scenarios
including
competitive
spillovers
scenarios
and
this
observation
highlights
the
tradeoff
between
utility
maximizing
platforms
that
simply
aim
to
meet
an
egalitarian
notion
of
fairness
and
society
which
aims
to
ensure
fairness
in

that

user
groups
notice
that
the
added
impression
constraint
yields
monotonically
increasing
cost
of
fairness
with
increasing
competitive
spillovers
this
occurs
because
the
platform
cannot
just
show
fewer

to
all

in

to
to

which

platform
utility
depends
on
the
type
of
fairness
considered
we
find
that
platform
costs
of
ensuring
statistical
parity
are
signif
icantly
higher
than
other
criteria
on
the
other
hand
our
results
show
that
this
tradeoff
is
negligible
when
equality
of
opportunity
is
the
only
criterion
considered
these
findings
also
highlight
the
impossibility
of
fairness
effect
which
means
there
is
tradeoff
between
different
notions
of
fairness

this
means
that
en
forcing
fairness
notion
may
have
positive
effects
on
some
other
fairness
notions
but
negative

on
others
for

summary
of
the
key
insights
and
policy
recommendations
to
improve
the
fairness
of
algorithmic
ad
delivery
systems
key
insights
policy
recommendations
as
harmful
effects
may
stem
from
the
process
of
optimizing
ad
delivery
efficiency-driven
online
ad
systems
inherently
exhibit
un
fairness
even
with
restricted
targeting
options
prioritizing
fairness
can
lead
to
unintended
consequences
regulation
must
go
beyond
limiting
the
use
of
sensitive
information
for
ad
targeting
independent
audits
of
ad
delivery
systems
should
be
mandated
as
side-effects
of
fairness-enhancing
interventions
can
be
undesirable
from
societal
perspective
any
audits
introduced
as
part
of
settlements
such
as
leveling
down
effect
achieving
fairness
by
harm
ing
the
privileged
group
without
uplifting
others
inherent
differences
among
targeted
user
groups
often
pre
or
regulation
like
the
dma
the
dsa
or
the
ai
act
in
the
european
union
must
also
monitor
by
what
means
exactly
fairness
is
achieved
and
whether
platforms
are
passing
the
cost
onto
the
end-users
the
selection
of
fairness
metrics
determines
who
benefits
from
the
clude
satisfying
multiple
fairness
metrics
simultaneously
intervention
thus
the
choice
of
metric
requires
substantial
evaluation
our
findings
also
contribute
to
the
debate
on
the
leveling
down
objection
which
challenges
the
idea
of
egalitarianism
and
suggests
that
enforcing
group
fairness
for
ad
impressions
on
online
plat
forms
may
lead
to
worse
outcomes
for
all
groups
16

37
we
demonstrate
that
enforcing
fairness
in
the
presence
of
large
com
petitive
spillovers
can
lead
to
the
leveling
down
effect
as
achieving
equality
by
harming
the
better-off
group
becomes
optimal
from
the
platform
perspective
we
show
that
this
scenario
can
be
pre
vented
if
the
platform
enforces
fixed
number
of
high-stakes
ad
impressions
in
both
unconstrained
and
constrained
scenarios
as
result
the
cost
of
the
fairness
intervention
would
be
carried
by
the
platform
rather
than
by
its
users
while
our
results
imply
that
the
costs
of
fairness
can
be
shifted
from
the
users
to
the
platform
in
practice
platforms
could
still
pass
them
on
to
the
advertisers
unless
specifically
prevented
from
doing
so
by
regulation
there
fore
any
proposed
policy
should
consider
the
downstream
effects
of
enforcing
any
fairness
criteria
on
the
cost
and
availability
of
high-stakes
advertising
taken
together
our
findings
are
crucial
in
light
of
the
current
discussion
of
what
fair
ad
delivery
system
should
look
like
which
fairness
criteria
are
defensible
and
what
downstream
effects
they
would
lead
to
as
well
as
who
should
carry
the
burden
of
introduc
ing
the
constraints
policy
recommendations
significant
regulatory
responses
have
been
initiated
in
the
us
in
the
form
of
the

against

in
the
form
of
the
digital

act
the
digital
markets
act
and
the
recently
approved
artificial
intelligence
act
however
our
findings
indicate
that
ex
isting
measures
may
not
suffice
effective
external
monitoring
is
essential
to
ensure
fair
ad
delivery
and
potential
side-effects
must
be
carefully
considered

the

us
to

the

of

in
practice
the
actual
utility
costs
of
enforcing
fairness
might
be

in
addition
more
research
is
needed
to
investigate
the
long-term
effects
of

market

whether
advertisers

in

conclusion
unfair
delivery
of
high-stakes
ads
online
has
significant
societal
effects
it
can
perpetuate
and
exacerbate
existing
inequalities
and
discrimination
by
reinforcing
stereotypes
and
biases
that
have
far
reaching
consequences
for
individuals
and
society
as
whole
in
this
paper
we
focus
on
the
goal
of
ensuring
equitable
access
to
relevant
information
that
is
shared
through
online
advertisement
such
as
housing
or
job
opportunities
in
conclusion
our
study
highlights
the
need
for
explicit
enforcement
of
fairness
in
online
ad
delivery
systems
fairness
is
not
satisfied
by
default
and
simply
re
stricting
advertisers
targeting
options
does
not
ensure
fairness
our
study
indicates
that
while
ensuring
fairness
in
online
ad
systems
reduces
platform
utility
achieving
predictive
parity
or
equality
of
opportunity
generally
incurs
lower
utility
cost
than
achieving
statistical
parity
our
findings
reveal
tradeoffs
between
different
notions
of
fairness
for
example
enforcing
statistical
parity
leads
to
larger
disparities
in
ctrs
between
groups
moreover
pursuing
fairness
can
result
in
potentially
undesirable
side-effects
such
as
leveling
down
effects
that
occur
in
the
presence
of
competitive
spillovers
which
must
be
actively
mitigated
as
online
program
matic
advertising
continues
to
evolve
our
findings
are
important
for
ensuring
fairness
of
ad
impressions
for
historically

the

we

in

additionally
it

solutions
that
exist
for

of
those

statistical
parity
requires
that
the
proportion
of
individuals
who
receive
positive
decision
is
the
same
across
different
groups
defined
by
sensitive
attribute
race
or
gender
in
the
context
of
online
ad
delivery
this
means
that
the
proportion
of
individuals
who
are
shown
an
ad
should
be
the
same
across
different
groups
defined
by
equality
of
opportunity
also
known
as
tpr
parity
requires
that
the
true
positive
rate
tpr
is
equal
across
different
groups
the
tpr
is
the
proportion
of
individuals
who
are
correctly
identified
as
belonging
to
the
positive
class
out
of
all
individuals
who
actually
belong
to
the
positive
class
in
the
context
of
online
ad
delivery
the
tpr
refers
to
the
share
of
people
seeing
specific
ad
among
all
those
that
would
click
on
the
ad
false
positive
rate
fpr
parity
is
conceptually
similar
to
equality
of
opportunity
but
it
focuses
on
the
proportion
of
people
seeing
the
ad
among
all
those
that
would
not
click
on
it
that
belong
to
the
negative
class
predictive
parity
also
known
as
ppv
parity
requires
that
the
positive
predictive
value
ppv
is
the
same
across
different
groups
the
ppv
is
the
proportion
of
individuals
who
actually
belong
to
the
positive
class
out
of
all
individuals
who
are
identified
as
such
in
the
context
of
online
ad
delivery
the
ppv
corresponds
to
the
proportion
of
individuals
clicking
on
an
ad
among
all
those
that
got
to
see
it
hence
enforcing
predictive
parity
is
equivalent
to
equalizing
click-through
rates
ctr
false
omission
rate
for
parity
is
conceptually

this

it

for
example
instead
of

the

it
visualizes
the

notice
that
those
simulations
only
differ
in
their
shape
parameters
for
the
clicking
distribution
in
particular
we
use
larger
shape
parameter
which
represents
larger
average
probability
of
clicking
on
the
high-stakes
ad
for
men
28
and
different

all
other

are
equivalent
to
the
corresponding
scenarios

the

in

for
the
four
scenarios
a2
b2
c2

d2
as
can
be
seen
on
the

the
effect
size
increases
compared
to
the
scenarios
and
where
men
average
clicking
probability
for
the
high-stakes
ad
is
lower
if
men
are
on
average
more
likely
to
click
on
the
high-stakes
ad
men
are
more
likely
to
see
this
high-stakes
ad
since
advertisers
are
willing
to
pay
more
for
their
high-stakes
ad
to
be
shown
to
men
the
increased
cost
of
fairness
is
direct
consequence
of
this
increased
br
differences
between
men
and
women

this
means
that
