ABSTRACT

2

While search efficacy has been evaluated traditionally on the basis
of result relevance, fairness of search has attracted recent attention.
In this work, we define a notion of distributional fairness and provide a conceptual framework for evaluating search results based
on it. As part of this, we formulate a set of axioms which an ideal
evaluation framework should satisfy for distributional fairness. We
show how existing TREC test collections can be repurposed to
study fairness, and we measure potential data bias to inform test
collection design for fair search. A set of analyses show metric divergence between relevance and fairness, and we describe a simple
but flexible interpolation strategy for integrating relevance and
fairness into a single metric for optimization and evaluation.

IR systems face existing societal bias, such as gender [5], and racial
[14] inequality. Application areas such as resume-search [19] and
political news-search [8–10] demonstrate this. Two types of fairness
are Individual Fairness and Group Fairness [5]. Group Fairness ensures that all protected groups are treated equally, while Individual
Fairness ensures that all individuals are treated equally1 .
Researchers have proposed different methods to tackle the bias
in IR systems [2–4, 18–20]. These approaches include new ranking algorithms taking fairness constraints into account [4], postprocessing method for re-ranking existing systems considering
both individual and group fairness [19], and evaluation of ranking
systems in terms of fairness [18] from a group fairness perspective. IBM-3602 is an industry standard for evaluating fairness in
machine learning algorithms and datasets. However, it does not
include measurements for ranking systems. Recent work such as
Sapiezynski et al. [15], Yang and Stoyanovich [18] has begun to
explore evaluating search fairness.

INTRODUCTION

Algorithmic fairness is now receiving significant attention, and
with search systems increasingly mediating human information
access, it is recognized that search systems must be fair as well as
accurate. However, while the idea of fairness is intuitive, there are
many competing definitions of how to operationalize it in practice.
There is also increasing recognition today that dataset bias (e.g.,
imbalance) can lead to biased training or evaluation. For example,
while one might desire balanced search results, an imbalanced
dataset distribution can make this goal more difficult to achieve in
practice. To the extent relevant information is more scarce for some
perspectives or categories, imbalance in relevant information may
lead to imbalance in retrieved results. When relevant information
for given a category is scarce (or completely absent), it may be
difficult (or impossible) for IR systems to find any relevant results
from that category to retrieve. Diversity thus plays a role in test
collection design, and decisions must be made as to which categories
it will be important to ensure diversity in terms of documents
included in the collection and relevance annotation.
In this work, we define a notion of distributional fairness and
provide a conceptual framework for evaluating search results based
on it (Section 4). Section 3 formulates a set of axioms which an
ideal evaluation framework should satisfy for distributional fairness. In Section 5, we show how existing TREC test collections can
be repurposed to study fairness, and Section 5.1 measures potential
data bias to inform test collection design for fair search. A set of
analyses presented in Section 5 show metric divergence between
relevance and fairness, and a simple but flexible interpolation strategy for integrating relevance and fairness into a single metric for
optimization and evaluation. We first provide brief background.

RELATED WORK

EVALUATION DESIDERATA

Motivated by Lioma et al. [11], we propose desiderata for evaluating
ranking systems that are both fair and relevant. We also include
the notion of authoritativeness, especially keeping in mind modern
challenges such as polarization and misinformation.
D1 Fairness: A ranking system should return a set of documents
that fairly represent different types of contents. Fairness can
have different definitions. Two of them are described below.
D1.1 Equality: A ranking system should return documents
from different types in equal proportion, regardless of the
distribution of content
D1.2 Equity: A ranking system should return documents from
different types where the frequency of documents reflects
the distribution of contents in real world
D2 Exposure Bias: In the ranking output, there should not be
any presentation bias for relevant documents across different types, i.e., certain types of document should not always
appear before the other types [3, 16]
D2.1 The property of Fair Exposure should hold across any Q
number of arbitrary queries
D3 Relevance: A system should always return a document that
is more relevant above a less relevant document
D4 Generalizability: At any K-th intersection of a ranking, documents should be both relevant and fairly represented
D5 Authoritativeness: For some specific topics, a ranking system can have a deliberate authoritative bias imposed on a
type of information to avoid misinformation

APPROACH

In this section we describe our conceptual framework for evaluating fairness in search results. The key tenet of our approach is
that documents can be organized into categories, and that IR systems should ensure some degree of balanced coverage over these
categories in search results. Key concepts include:
Document Categories. we assume a single set of static document categories (e.g., topical: news vs. sports documents),
irrespective of topic. At evaluation, we know the number of
categories and labels for each document.
Results Distribution. The actual distribution of documents
over categories in search results, notated as R(c), the results
distribution (as estimated) over categories.
Target Distribution. The desired distribution of documents
over categories in search results. The target distribution may
be arbitrarily specified (e.g., uniform), reflect a distributional
prior, or be empirically-derived (e.g., a dataset distribution).
We assume in this work that the target distribution is constant across search topics. We denote the target distribution
as QT (c), where T denotes the target distribution type.
Estimation. Each of the above distributions may be estimated
from observed data, simply by relative frequency (maximum
likelihood), or with some form of regulation or smoothing.
In this work, we apply simple add-1 Laplacian smoothing3
when estimating empirical results and dataset distributions.
Distributional Fairness. We define “fairness” by distributional
similarity: how closely the results distribution matches the
target distribution. We must specify distributional similarity.
Integrative measures. Beyond measuring relevance and fairness as distinct aspects of system performance, it can be
useful to integrate them into a single measure. This requires
specifying how metrics can be combined.
The Target Distribution. What distribution should be targeted?
All things being equal (i.e., lacking prior information), a uniform
distribution targets balanced, equal coverage and respecting the
principle of maximum entropy4 . However, given prior information,
one may specify a non-uniform target distribution. For example,
we may expect search results to respect some prior distribution. For
a given dataset, we might observe a given population distribution
(e.g., perhaps 65% of documents are written in English) and want
search results to be representative of this larger population.
Fairness. As noted above, we define “fairness” by distributional
similarity between results R(c) and target QT (c) distributions. Specifically, we compute KL-divergence5 . As discussed in the next subsection, it is useful to have relevance and fairness on the same
scale before combining them into a single measure. We thus apply
min-max normalization6 N[·]. This produces a score ∈ [0, 1], but
with 0 as most fair (no distributional divergence) and 1 as least fair.
For ease of interpretation and consistency with relevance metrics,
we reverse the scale so F=1 is most fair. Given a target distribution
T , we thus compute Fairness FT = 1 − N [ KL (R(c)||QT (c)) ].

Das and Lease
Combining Relevance and Fairness. Regardless of how relevance (R) and fairness (F) are measured, it may be useful to integrate
these into a single measure. For example, F-measure interpolates
between precision and recall via the harmonic mean.
In this work, we apply arithmetic and geometric means as simple
interpolation methods between normalized fairness and relevance
scores[6, 13]. As with MAP vs. gMAP, the arithmetic mean is more
tolerant to imbalance in inputs, whereas the geometric mean more
heavily penalizes such imbalance. In general, one can specify a
smoothing parameter to weight the mixture (e.g., F-measure lets
one weight precision vs. recall, though simple, unweighted F-1
is typically used). We leave such parameterized interpolation for
future work but note the flexibility exists for balancing R and F.
As noted above, we apply min-max normalization to define fairness in range [0,1]. While relevance measures are typically also
defined in that same interval, we apply consistent normalization to
R as well so both R and F fully span [0,1] before they are mixed.
Axiomatic Analysis Our approach to measuring fairness is
grounded in the idea of diversity. For example, "intent-aware" evaluation metrics originally developed for topical diversity [1] could
be adapted to evaluating over protected attributes for diversity. The
general connection between topical diversity and fairness has also
been noticed elsewhere Ekstrand et al. [6].
Our framework incorporates two different aspects of the proposed evaluation desiderata, D1 and D3. The notion of distributional
fairness can satisfy different definitions of fairness as well. As long
as a target distribution can be estimated based on a particular definition of fairness, our approach can be used to score a search system.
The idea of Generalizability (D4) of metrics is also incorporated
in our approach. Our method can provide insight on the fairness
aspect as well as the relevance aspect of search results at any k-th
intersection. Our combined metric (gmean) also enforces that a system needs to perform well both in terms of relevance and fairness.
There is an implicit sense of authoritativeness (D5) incorporated
into our approach. Since one of the ways we measure fairness is
to compare with the dataset distribution, a test-collection with authoritative stands for some topics encourages systems to retrieve
more results from some perspectives vs. others. However, since we
do not consider rank order here in calculating fairness, a system
performing well on our fairness metrics can still have exposure bias
(as defined in D2).

EXPERIMENTS

Evaluation seeks to understand two over-arching questions: 1) How
system performance varies under relevance vs. fairness (or combined) metrics; and 2) How well these metrics meet evaluation
desiderata proposed in Section 3.
Datasets: Blogs07 and TREC-8 Adhoc. We first describe how
we adapt two existing TREC test collections to study fairness.
TREC-8 Adhoc [17] considers topics 401-450 with binary relevance judgments for four Newswire sources: Financial Times, Los
Angeles Times, Foreign Broadcast Information Service, and Federal
Register. 129 participant rankings were obtained from TREC. This
track also did not consider fairness, and we re-interpret system
performance here with a new assumption that a fair ranking should
provide diverse coverage across these different four news sources.

The Blogs07 [12] opinion retrieval task had participant ranking
systems retrieve relevant blog posts with a given opinion for 50
topics. The collection contains binary relevance judgments and
four opinion labels: no opinion, negative, mixed, and positive. 104
participant rankings were obtained from TREC7 . While the track
did not consider fairness, we re-interpret performance of those
systems under a new assumption that a fair ranking should ensure
diverse coverage across the four opinion categories.

5.1

Identifying Potential Test Collection Bias

Our first analysis explores whether the underlying test collections
are balanced or imbalanced across categories. As discussed earlier,
more or less balance in relevant information across categories in an
underlying test collection will likely lead to more or less balanced
coverage of categories (i.e., distributional fairness) in search results.
Note that since we are repurposing existing datasets to study this
notion of distributional fairness, we are not disputing anything
about the particular test collections under consideration, but rather
describing a method by which one could design or assess a test
collection over actual categories of interest for ensuring fairness.
Figures 1a and 1b present the distribution of relevant documents
across topics by category for each collection. As noted above, TREC8 categories are the four newswire sources, while for Blogs07, we
have four categories of opinion. We see that relevant information for
some categories is more scarce (e.g., FR for TREC-8) or abundant (no
7 http://trec.nist.gov/results/

opinion for Blogs07), so there is potential for imbalance in relevant
information that could lead to imbalance in retrieved results.

5.2

Score correlation: Relevance vs. Fairness

We next aim to understand the degree to which relevance and
fairness (for uniform or dataset target distributions) are correlated.
We hypothesize low correlation, which would motivate measuring
both metrics and potentially optimizing retrieval results for some
combination thereof. We measure R-Precision as our relevance
metric due to its robustness when there are few relevant documents
for a given category, per the previous analysis.
Figure 2 shows R-Precision vs. fairness scores for participating
systems in TREC-8 and Blogs07 tracks. System scores are sorted
by decreasing R-Prec, shown as green bars, with scores measured
on the left y-axis. For each system, we also see corresponding
fairness scores for two target distributions: uniform (blue) and
dataset population (cyan), as measured on the right y-axis.
The figures confirm that systems indeed perform differently for
fairness and relevance metrics. We see that R-Precision scores of
systems and the uniform target fairness scores are inversely correlated. However, when we compare the R-Precision scores with
the dataset population target distribution, scores are more correlated (i.e., a random sample of relevant documents would tend to be
representative of the population distribution in the test collection).
The more imbalanced relevant documents are by category in the
collection, the more population and uniform will diverge. We also
infer that ranking systems are usually optimized to reflect on the

, July, 2019,
distribution of documents in the test collection itself. Figures 1 and
2 suggest that to build fair ranking systems, we should also focus
on developing fair test-collections as well.

5.3

Top Systems: Relevance vs. Fairness

Another way to look at the relationship between relevance and
fairness is to look at which systems perform best for each metric.
Tables 1 and 2 report the top-3 systems for each metric, as well as
for arithmetic and geometric means which integrate both measures.
We see that the highest performing systems for R-Precision have
very low fairness scores, and vice versa. Naturally, this inverse
relationship between relevance and fairness also influences both
arithmetic and geometric means. For both tracks, we see that the
top systems for relevance are largely also the top systems for the
arithmetic mean, but the geometric mean penalizes low fairness
more heavily and so tends to select systems that are more balanced
across relevance and fairness.
Recalling our high-level evaluation desiderata (Section 3), RPrecision does not tell us much beyond D3 (Relevance). Similarly,
fairness does not inform us about any other evaluation criteria
except for D1 (Fairness). However, the interpolation of fairnessrelevance scores helps incorporate all of D1, D3, and D4.

Rank Correlation: Relevance vs. Fairness

Another question is how evaluating systems based on relevance vs.
fairness leads to different relative orderings over participant systems. To explore this, we assume a baseline ordering of participant
systems based on R-Precision, then consider how system rankings
based on fairness measure differ, as measured by Kendall’s τ .
Table 3 show that the rank-correlation across these metrics is
quite low. The top 2 rows consider 2 target distributions: uniform
and population (i.e., ground truth in dataset). The bottom 2 rows
consider ranking induced by mean and gmean between uniform
target and R-Precision. This adds further evidence to our earlier
results in showing that evaluating systems by relevance vs. fairness
leads to quite different results in our assessment of IR systems.
Moreover, this highlights the need to consider both relevance and
fairness based metrics in designing and optimizing algorithms.

CONCLUSION

We defined a notion of distributional fairness and provide a conceptual framework for evaluating of search results based on it. As
part of this work, we formulated a set of axioms which an ideal
evaluation framework should satisfy for distributional fairness. We
showed how existing TREC test collections can be repurposed to
study fairness, and we measured potential data bias to inform test
collection design for fair search. A set of analyses showed metric
divergence between relevance and fairness, and we described a
simple but flexible interpolation strategy for integrating relevance
and fairness into a single metric for optimization and evaluation.
Limitations. We have repurposed existing TREC test collections
to study fairness, but it would be better to avoid surrogate data.
While we have defined fairness on a set-basis, our distributional
approach can be easily extended to estimate the results distribution
based on rank information, assigning greater weight to categories
observed at higher ranks, addressing the exposure bias (D2) desiderata currently missed. Our min-max normalization simplifies metric
combination but causes scores to change based on which systems
are being compared, so this should also be revisited. There is also a
scope of feedback loops reinforcing biases in search systems[7]. A
future direction would be to expand the evaluation desiderata to
have a measure for feedback loops.
