Shaping the Web: Why the Politics of Search
Engines Matters

This article argues that search engines raise not merely technical
issues but also political ones. Our study of search engines suggests
that they systematically exclude (in some cases by design and in
some, accidentally) certain sites and certain types of sites in favor
of others, systematically giving prominence to some at the expense
of others. We argue that such biases, which would lead to a narrowing of the Web’s functioning in society, run counter to the basic
architecture of the Web as well as to the values and ideals that have
fueled widespread support for its growth and development. We
consider ways of addressing the politics of search engines, raising
doubts whether, in particular, the market mechanism could serve
as an acceptable corrective.

Enhanced by the technology of the World Wide Web, it
has become an integral part of the ever-expanding global
media system, moving onto center stage of media politics
alongside traditional broadcast media—television and radio. Enthusiasts of the “new medium” have heralded it as
a democratizing force that will give voice to diverse social, economic, and cultural groups, to members of society
not frequently heard in the public sphere. It will empower
the traditionally disempowered, giving them access both
to typically unreachable nodes of power and to previously
inaccessible troves of information.
To scholars of traditional media, these optimistic claims
must have a ring of familiarity, echoing similar optimistic
predictions concerning the democratizing and empowering capacities of both radio and television. Instead of the
expected public gains and ful lment of democratic possibilities, instead of the spreading of access and power,
however, the gains, the power, and the access were consolidated in the hands of a few dominant individuals and
institutions. In the words of acclaimed media critic Robert
McChesney (1999, p. 1 ),
The American media system is spinning out of control
in a hyper-commercialized frenzy. Fewer than ten transnational media conglomerates dominate much of our media;
fewer than two dozen account for the overwhelming majority of our newspapers, magazines,  lms, television, radio, and
books. With every aspect of our media culture now fair game
for commercial exploitation, we can look forward to the fullscale commercialization of sports, arts, and education, the
disappearance of notions of public service from public discourse, and the degeneration of journalism, political coverage, and children’s programming under commercial pressure.

McChesney’s work (1993, 1997b ) traces—in very subtle and convincing detail—how commercial interests were
woven into the very  ber of the modern media networks
through legislation, market mechanisms, and the like.

These moves progressively pushed out and silenced the
public service agenda, which was very central to the vision
of the early pioneers in the  eld—McChesney’s (1993 )
historical account of radio is very telling in this regard.
His central argument, historically grounded, is that the
fundamental course of media is determined primarily by
how they’re owned and operated. Most U.S. communication media—going back to AM radio in the 1920s—have
followed this path: At  rst, when they do not seem commercially viable, they are developed by the nonpro t, noncommercial sector. When their pro t-making potential
emerges, however, the corporate sector starts colonizing
the media, and through a variety of mechanisms, usually
its dominance of politicians, muscles out the rest and takes
over. McChesney argues that this pattern is seen in the
cases of FM radio, in UHF television, and to some extent
in satellite and cable.
On the prospects of the Internet, there are divergent predictions. Some, like Dan Schiller (1995 ) and McChesney,
in uenced by their knowledge of other media, anticipate
a similar narrowing of prospects for the Internet. They
point to the commitment of the United States to private
ownership of communications technology as the single
most important and consistent historical policy position
that in uenced the course of telecommunications development. And this same commitment is clearly evident in
the rhetoric of the political foundations of the Internet,
namely, the fact that of  ve “values” that Vice-President
Gore identi ed as ones that should de ne and guide the
development of the Global Internet Infrastructure (GII ),
the  rst one listed was “private investment” (Of ce of the
Vice President, 1995 ). Schiller asks, “What is the likelihood of robust adherence to . . . elemental democratic prescription, when the character of the network development
is now all-too-evidently to be given mainly as a function
of unrestrained corporate ambition and private design?”
(Schiller, 1995, p. 6 ). Others, like Mark Poster (1995 ),
offer a contrasting view, arguing that the distinctly “postmodern” nature of the Internet, with its capacity to disseminate material rather than centralize it, will discourage
the endowment of authority—both academic and political. Its development, therefore, is unlikely to mirror that
of previous media.
The broader debate about the dual possibilities of
media—to be democratizing or to be colonized by specialized interests at the expense of the public good—inspires
and motivates this article on the politics of search engines.
The general position we defend, and illustrate in this one
case, is that although the Internet and the Web offer exciting prospects for furthering the public good, the bene ts
are conditional, resting precariously on a number of political, economic, and technical factors. Following Poster,
we are buoyed by clear instances where the Web and Internet have served broad political and ends. But we also

see irrefutable signs of gradual centralization and commercialization of guiding forces. Like McChesney, we are
particularly concerned with the way these competing interests (centralized commercial vs. decentralized public )
may, early on, be woven in, or out, of the very  ber of
media networks. Search engines constitute a particularly
telling venue for this competition. And prospects, as seen
from the perspective of the time of writing this article, do
not look good for broad public interests.
Search engines constitute a powerful source of access
and accessibility within the Web. Access, already a thorny
issue, is the subject of much scholarship and research
(Golding, 1994; Hoffman & Novak, 1998; Pollack, 1995;
Schiller, 1995 ), as well as a lengthy report by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA ), Falling Through the Net. Focusing on social,
economic, and racial factors, these works show how access
to the Web is precon gured in subtle but politically important ways, resulting in exclusion of signi cant voices. It
is not enough, however, to worry about overcoming these
traditional barriers, to focus only on the granting of entry
to the media space of the Web. It is not enough if, as we argue, the space itself is distorted in favor of those wealthy in
technical or economic resources through the mechanism
of biased search engines. The politics of search engines
thus represents the broader struggle to sustain the democratic potential of traditional media, the Internet, and the
World Wide Web in particular.
In a statistical study of Web search engines, S. Lawrence
and C. L. Giles (1999 ) estimated that none of the search
engines they studied, taken individually, index more than
16% of the total indexable Web, which they estimate to
consist of 800 million pages. Combining the results of the
search engines they studied, they estimated the coverage
to increase to approximately 42%. This con rms the primitive impressions of many users, namely, that the Web is
almost inconceivably large, and also that search engines
only very partially meet the desperate need for an effective
way of  nding things. 1 When judging what the producers
of search engines have accomplished so far, optimists, focusing on the half-full portion of the cup, may legitimately
marvel at the progress in Web search technologies and at
the sheer bulk of pages that are successfully found. In this
article, however, we are concerned with the half-empty
portion of the cup: the portions of the Web that remain
hidden from view.
The purpose of this article is not, however, to bemoan
the general dif culties of building comprehensive search
engines, nor to highlight the technological dif culties that
must surely impose limits on the range of scope and coverage that even the best search engines can achieve. Our
concern, rather, is with the ways that developers, designers, and producers of search engines will direct these technological limitations, the in uences that may come into

POLITICS OF SEARCH ENGINES

play in determining any systematic inclusions and exclusions, the wide-ranging factors that dictate systematic
prominence for some sites, dictating systematic invisibility for others. These, we think, are political issues. 2 They
are important because what people (the seekers ) are able
to  nd on the Web determines what the Web consists of
for them. And we all—individuals and institutions alike—
have a great deal at stake in what the Web consists of.
A BRIEF AND SELECTIVE TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
Although a complete discussion of the technical detail of
search engines is beyond the scope of this article, 3 we highlight aspects of search engines that we consider relevant
to our discussion of their politics. We brie y discuss the
nature of the connection between search engines and Web
pages, the process by which this relationship is established,
and how this relationship affects the producers (or owners ) of Web pages wishing to have their pages recognized.
Web-page providers seeking recognition from search engines for their Web pages must focus on two key tasks:
(a ) being indexed and (b ) achieving a ranking in the top
10 – 20 search results displayed. 4
On Being Indexed
Having a page indexed, the essential  rst stage of being recognized by search engines, is extremely important.
Without much exaggeration one could say that to exist is
to be indexed by a search engine. If a Web page is not
in the index of a search engine, a person wishing to access it must know the complete Uniform Resource Locator (URL )—also known as the Web page address—such
as http://is.lse.ac.uk/lucas/cepe98.html for the CEPE’98
conference. 5 Since there is no rigid standard for producing URLs, they are not obvious or even logical in the
way we tend to think that the addresses of our physical homes are logical. 6 Sometimes the Internet domainname structure may help, such as “ac.uk” or “edu” for an
academic institution in the United Kingdom or United
States. However, for most searches we do not have any
idea of the URLs involved. 7
This is where search engines enter the picture. They
create a map of the Web by indexing Web pages according
to keywords and then create enormous databases that link
page content to keywords to URLs. When a seeker of information submits a keyword (or phrase )—presumably, one
that best captures his or her interest—the searchengine database returns to the seeker a list of URLs linked
to that keyword, ideally including all those that are relevant
to the seeker’s interest. It is important to note that search
engines use the notion of a keyword (i.e., that which is
indexed and hence used for searching ) in a rather minimal
sense. Keywords are not determined a priori by the de-

171

signers of the search engines’ databases nor, explicitly, by
some other authority, but rather they are “deduced” from
Web pages themselves in the process of indexing. In a particular Web page a keyword can be any of the following:
keywords indicated by the Web-page de Actual
signer in an HTML metatag as follows: <meta





NAME =“keywords” CONTENT =“list of keywords”>.
All or some of the words appearing in the title
that is indicated by the HTML <TITLE> tag as
follows: <TITLE>Whatever is the title of the
page</TITLE>.
The  rst X words in a Web page (possibly excluding stop words8 ).
All the words in the Web page (possibly excluding
stop words ).

Most search engines use at least some of the words in
the title tag of the Web page as the relevant keywords
for indexing purposes. 9 It is obviously important for Webpage producers as well as seekers to know what words on a
particular Web page are seen as keywords by the indexing
software of search engines. Thus, one might naturally ask:
How does a search engine go about creating its database
and what does it store in it?
The answer to this question depends on which of basically two categories (and within these categories, the
further subcategories ) the search engine  ts. One category
includes directory-based search engines such as Yahoo!
and Aliweb. In this category, the vast majority of the pages
indexed are manually submitted to the search engines’ editors by Webmasters (and other creators of Web pages ).10
The other category includes search engines that automatically harvest URLs by means of spiders (also referred to
as robots or softbots ). Among the most well-known search
engines  tting this category are Alta Vista, Lycos, and
Hotbot.
In the case of directory-based search engines, Web-page
creators submit URLs to the search engines for possible
inclusion into their databases. If you wanted your page recognized by Yahoo!, for example, you would submit your
URL and background information to a human editor, who
would review the page and decide whether or not to schedule your page for indexing. If your page is scheduled for
indexing, it would be retrieved by the indexing software,
which would parse11 the page and index it according to
the keywords (content ) found in the page. For directorybased search engines, therefore, human gatekeepers hold
the key to inclusion in their indexed databases. At the time
of the writing this article, there is a considerable backlog,
so this process can take up to six months from the time of
submission to the time of inclusion.
Web owners wishing to have their pages indexed must
surely wonder what criteria these human editors use to

172

L. D. INTRONA AND H. NISSENBAUM

decide whether or not to index their pages. This is a major
bone of contention, especially for anyone contesting these
decision criteria. With Yahoo!, for example, representatives say that they use criteria of relevancy (Phua, 1998 ).
The exact nature of these criteria, however, is not widely
known or publicly disseminated and, evidently, these criteria are not consistently applied by the various editors. As
a result, you may have your page rejected (without noti cation ) and would not know what to do to get it accepted.
Danny Sullivan, the editor of Search Engine Watch, believes that the base success rate for any submitted page’s
being listed with Yahoo! is approximately 25%. Two factors that seem to increase the chances of being listed are the
number of links (to and from a given site—also referred to
as inlinks and outlinks ) and how full a particular category
happens to be. When editors feel they need more references
within a category, they lower the entry barriers. Defending
their approach, representatives of Yahoo! maintain they
list what users want, arguing that if users were not  nding
relevant information they would cease using Yahoo!. (We
return to this form of response later. ) With Aliweb, a very
small site in comparison to its competitors, users submit
supplemental information about their Web-page content
and keywords as a way of helping the indexing software
improve the quality of its indexing and hence provide better search results. Representatives of Aliweb emphasize
that they do not provide comprehensive coverage; rather,
they emphasize high-quality search results. Because this is
a small site, it is still able to index most of its submissions.
As it becomes larger, it may, like its competitors, need to
establish criteria for inclusion and exclusion.
Being indexed by search engines that automatically harvest URLs is a matter of being visited by a spider (also
called robot, crawler, softbot, agent, etc. ). Spiders usually
start crawling from a historical list of URLs, especially
documents with many links elsewhere, such as server lists,
“What’s New” pages, and other popular sites on the Web.
Software robots crawl the Web—that is, automatically traverse the Web’s hypertext structure— rst retrieving a document and then recursively retrieving all documents that
are referenced (linked by other URLs) in the original document. Web owners interested in having their pages indexed might wish they had access to details concerning
the routes spiders follow when they crawl, which sites
they favor, which they visit and how often, which not, and
so forth. This, however, is a complicated technical subject,
and the details are steadfastly guarded as trade secrets by
the respective search engine companies. From our experience and discussions with those involved in the  eld, we
would contend with some certainty that spiders are guided
by a set of criteria that steer them in a systematic way to
select certain types of sites and pages and not select others. However, the blackout on information about search

engine crawl algorithms means we can only try to infer
the character of these algorithms from search engine selection patterns—an inexact exercise.
We have learned something of the nature of spider algorithms from a paper on ef cient crawling by Cho, GarciaMolina, and Page,12 presented at the WWW7 conference
(Cho et al., 1998 ). This paper, which discusses commonly
used metrics for determining the “importance” of a Web
page by crawling spiders, provides key insights relevant to
the main claims of our article. Because of its signi cance,
we discuss it here in some detail. Cho et al. (1998, p. 1 )
write:
Given a Web page P, we can de ne the importance of the
page, I(P), in one of the following ways . . . :
1. Similarity to a Driving Query Q. A query Q drives the
crawling process, and I(P) is de ned to be the textual
similarity between P and Q . . . .
2. Backlink Count. The value of I(P) is the number of
links to P that appear over the entire web. We use IB(P)
to refer to this importance metric. Intuitively, a page
P that is linked to by many pages is more important
than one that is seldom referenced. On the web, IB(P)
is useful for ranking query results, giving end-users
pages that are more likely to be of general interest.
Note that evaluating IB(P) requires counting backlinks
over the entire web. A crawler may estimate this value
with IB0 (P), the number of links to P that have been
seen so far.
3. PageRank. The IB(P) metric treats all links equally.
Thus, a link from the Yahoo! home page counts the same
as a link from some individual’s home page. However,
since the Yahoo! home page is more important (it has
a much higher IB count), it would make sense to value
that link more highly. The PageRank backlink metric,
IR(P), recursively de nes the importance of a page
to be the weighted sum of the backlinks to it. Such
a metric has been found to be very useful in ranking
results of user queries [Page 1998.2 ]. We use IR0 (P)
for the estimated value of IR(P) when we have only a
subset of pages available.
4. Location Metric. The IL(P) importance of page P is a
function of its location, not of its contents. If URL u
leads to P, then IL(P) is a function of u. For example,
URLs ending with “.com” may be deemed more useful
than URLs with other endings, or URLs containing
the string “home” may be more of interest than other
URLs. Another location metric that is sometimes used
considers URLs with fewer slashes more useful than
those with more slashes. All these examples are local
metrics since they can be evaluated simply by looking
at the URLs.” [emphasis added]

The Similarity to a Driving Query Q metric uses a
query term or string (Q )—such as “holiday cottages,” for
example—as the basic heuristic for crawling. This means

POLITICS OF SEARCH ENGINES

that the spider does not need to make a decision about
importance since it will be directed in its search by the
query string itself. For our discussion, this metric is of
minor signi cance.13 The real issue emerges when the
crawling spider must “decide” importance without the
use of a submitted query term. This is where the other
metrics play the dominant role. The Backlink metric uses
the backlink (or inlink ) count as its importance heuristic.
The value of the backlink count is the number of links
to the page that appear over the entire Web—for example, the number of links over the entire Web that refer to
http://www.ibm.com. The assumption here is that “a page
that is linked to by many [other ] pages is more important than one that is seldom referenced.” Obviously, this
is a very reasonable heuristic. 14 We know from academic
research that it is wise to look at the “canonical” works
that are referred to—or cited in academic language—by
many other authors. We know also, however, that not all
topics necessarily have canons. Furthermore, although in
some  elds a small number of citations may make a particular work a canon, in other  elds it takes a vast number of citations to reach canonical status. Thus, the Backlink heuristic would tend to crawl and gather the large
topics/ elds (such as “shareware computer games” ) since
an even relatively unimportant site in this big  eld will
be seen as more important—have relatively more backlinks or inlinks— than an actually important site in a small
 eld (such as “the local community services information”
page ), which would have relatively less backlinks or inlinks. The essential point is that the large  elds determine
the measure, or threshold, of importance—through sheer
volume of backlinks—in ways that would tend to push out
the equally important small  elds. (We return to this issue
later, in our market discussion. ).
With the PageRank metric, this problem is exacerbated.
Instead of treating all links equally, this heuristic gives
prominence to backlinks from other important pages—
pages with high backlink counts. Thus, “since [a link from]
the Yahoo! home page is more important (it has a much
higher IB [backlink ] count ), it would make sense to value
that link more highly.” In the analogy of academic papers,
a metric like this would imply that a particular paper is
even more important if referred to by others who are already seen as important—by other canons. More simply,
you are important if others who are already seen as important indicate that you are important. The problem with the
Backlink and PageRank metrics is that they assume that
backlinks are a reliable indication of importance or relevance. In those cases where authors of pages create links
to other pages they see as valuable, this assumption may be
true. There are, however, many organizations that actively
cultivate backlinks by inducing Web-page creators to add
a link to their page through incentives such as discounts on

173

products, free software utilities, access to exclusive information, and so forth. Obviously, not all Web-page creators
have equal access to the resources or the incentive to induce others to link to them.
The Location Metric uses location information from the
URL to determine “next steps” in the crawl. “For example, URLs ending with ‘.com’ may be deemed more useful than URLs with other endings, or URLs containing the
string ‘home’ may be more of interest than other URLs.”
Even though the authors do not indicate what they see as
more important, one can assume that these decisions are
made when crawl heuristics are set for a particular spider.
It may therefore be of great signi cance “where you are
located” as to how important you are seen to be. With the
URL as the basis of decision making, many things can aid
you in catching the attention of the crawling spider, such
as having the right domain name, being located in the root
directory, and so forth. From this discussion on crawling
metrics we can conclude that pages with many backlinks,
especially backlinks from other pages with high backlink
counts, which are at locations seen as useful or important
to the crawling spider, will become targets for harvesting.
Another criterion that seems to guide spiders is breadth
or depth of representation. If a spider’s algorithm favors
breadth (rather than depth ), it would visit more sites (or
hosts ) but index them only partially. In the case of big
sites such as America Online (AOL ), Geocities, and so
forth, spiders will index them at a rate of approximately
10 – 15%.15 If your site is hosted on AOL or another big
site, there is a good chance that it will not be included.
Another reason that a site, and so all the pages on that
server, may be excluded from search engine databases is
that the owner/Webmaster of that server has excluded spiders through the robot exclusion standard by means of a
“robots.txt”  le.16 This is often done because requests for
pages from spiders may signi cantly increase the load on
a server and reduce the level of service to all other users.
CNN, for example, excludes all spiders from its site,17
as do many sites that offer free Web-page space.18 It is
also important to note that the harvesting spiders of the
search engines we looked at process only HTML  les and
in particular HTML tags. If important information on your
Website is in other formats, such as Acrobat (pdf )  les or
represented by a graphic (gif )  le, this information could
be lost in the indexing process. 19
Having said all of this, it ought to be acknowledged
that most spider-based search engines do also allow autonomous submissions by Webmasters/designers. Software is available that automatically generates the required
electronic formats and facilitates submission to a number of search engines simultaneously. Using this route has
had very mixed results, according to the Webmasters we
spoke to.

On Being Ranked
Indexing is but one hurdle to clear for the creators of Web
pages who strive for recognition through search engines.
Having been successful in the indexing game, their concern shifts to ranking. Many observe that to be noticed
by a person doing a search, a Web page has to be ranked
among the top 10 to 20 listed as hits. Because most search
engines display the 10 most relevant hits on the  rst page
of the search results, Web designers jealously covet those
10 or 20 top slots. The importance of ranking is regularly
discussed by leading authors in the  eld of Web-site promotion:
There is competition for those top ten seats. There is serious competition. People are trying to take away the top spots
every day. They are always trying to  ne-tune and tweak their
HTML code and learn the next little trick. The best players
even know dirty ways to “bump off ” their competition while
protecting their own sites (Anderson & Henderson, 1997).

Although we have not found large-scale empirical studies measuring the effects of ranking on the behavior of
seekers, we observe anecdotally that seekers are likely
to look down a list and then cease looking when they
 nd a “hit.” A study of travel agents using computerized airline reservations systems, which showed an overwhelming likelihood that they would select a  ight from
the  rst screenful of search results, is suggestive of what
we might expect among Web users at large (Friedman &
Nissenbaum, 1996 ). Indeed, if this were not the case it
would be dif cult to see why Webmasters are going to all
the effort to get into the  rst screen—and there is signi cant evidence that they do, indeed, take it very seriously.
Now it may be that it is not only the  rst screen but the
second and third screen as well. Nevertheless, even though
we cannot say without further research exactly where this
line may be (and it may vary with topic, type of searcher,
and so forth ), we can propose that it does matter whether
you are in the  rst few screens rather than much lower
down in the order. One could also argue such a position
from an information-overload point of view; we shall not
pursue it here (Wurman, 1989 ).
Relevancy ranking is an enormously dif cult task. Some
researchers working on search technologies argue that relevancy ranking is currently the greater challenge facing
search engines and that developments in technical knowhow and sheer capacity to  nd and index sites has not
nearly been matched by the technical capacity to resolve
relevancy ranking. Besides the engineering challenges, experts must struggle with the challenge of approximating a
complex human value (relevancy ) with a computer algorithm. In other words, according to these experts, while
we seem to be mastering the coverage issue, we con-

tinue to struggle with the issue of what precisely to extract from the enormous bulk of possibilities for a given
search. 20
Most ranking algorithms of search engines use both the
position and the frequency of keywords as a basis for their
ranking heuristics (Pringle et al., 1998 ). Accordingly, a
document with a high frequency of keywords in the beginning of a document is seen as more relevant (relative
to the keyword entered ) than one with a low frequency
lower down in the document. Other ranking schemes, like
the heuristic used by Lycos, are based on so-called inlink
popularity. The popularity score of a particular site is calculated based on the total number of other sites that contain
links to that site (also refer to backlink value, discussed earlier ). High link popularity leads to an improved ranking.
As with the crawl metrics discussed earlier, one sees the
standard or threshold of relevance being set by the big sites
at the expense of equally relevant small sites.
The desire and battle for ranking have generated a  eld
of knowledge called search engine design, which teaches
how to design a Web page in order to optimize its ranking and combines these teachings with software to assess its ranking potential. On one end of the spectrum,
practices that make reasonable use of prima facie reasonable heuristics help designers to optimize their Web
pages’ expected rankings when they are legitimately relevant to the person searching. On the other end of the
spectrum, some schemes allow Web designers to manipulate, or trick, the heuristics—schemes such as relevancy (or
keyword ) spamming, 21 where Web-page designers “trick”
the ranking algorithm into ranking their pages higher than
they deserve to be ranked by means of keyword stuffing, invisible text, tiny text, and so forth. Such spamming activities doubly punish the innocent. If, for example, you design a Web page with a few graphic images
at the beginning, followed somewhere toward the middle
with text, you would be severely “punished” by the algorithm both because key terms are positioned relatively low
down on the page and also because you would be competing for rank with those less, as it were, scrupulous in their
designs.
Out of this strange ranking warfare has emerged an impossible situation: Search-engine operators are loath to
give out details of their ranking algorithms for fear that
spammers will use this knowledge to trick them.22 Yet,
ethical Web-page designers can legitimately defend a need
to know how to design for, or indicate relevancy to, the
ranking algorithm so that those who search  nd what is
genuinely relevant to their searches. 23
Beyond the challenge of second-guessing ranking algorithms, there may yet be another, more certain, method
of getting results. Some producers of Web sites pursue

Reason for exclusion
(1) The human editor does not include your submission on the basis of criteria
not generally known and apparently inconsistently applied.
(1) Site not visited because of spider exclusion standard set by the Webmaster.
(2) Site not in the crawl path of the spider (not suf ciently rich in backlinks).
(3) Part of a large (often free) site that is only partially indexed.
(4) Documents don’t conform to HTML standard (pdf, gif, etc.).
(1) Did not buy the keyword or top spot.
(2) Not high in inlink popularity (from and to site).
(3) Relevant keywords not in meta tag or title.
(4) Keyword spammers have pushed you down.
(5) Important parts of your title are stop words.
(6) Your pages have been altered (dumped off ) through unethical practices
by your competitors.
(1) Using only one search engine (sometimes a default that user is unaware of ).
(2) Inappropriate use of search criteria.

of the technical fray: They try to buy them. This subject
is an especially sensitive one, and representatives of several major search engines indignantly deny that they sell
search positions. Recently, however, in a much-publicized
move, Alta Vista and Doublclick have invited advertisers to bid for positions in their top slots (Hansell, 1999 ).
Yahoo! sells prominence indirectly by allowing Web owners to pay for express indexing. This allows them to move
ahead in the 6-month queue. Another method for buying
prominence—less controversial but not unproblematic—
allows Web owners to buy keywords for purposes of banner
ads. Amazon Books, for example, has a comprehensive arrangement with Yahoo!, and Barnes & Noble has one with
Lycos. If a seeker submits a search to Yahoo! with the term
“book” in it, or a term with a name that corresponds to an
author’s name or book title in the Amazon database, the
seeker would get the Amazon banner (and URL ) on his or
her search result screen. This is also true for many other
companies and products.
The battle for ranking is fought not only between search
engines and Web masters/designers but also among organizations wishing for prominence. There is suf cient evidence to suggest that the  erce competition for both presence and prominence in a listing has led to practices such
as one organization’s retrieving a competitor’s Web page,
editing it so that it will not do well in the ranking, and
resubmitting it as an updated submission, or one organization’s buying a competitor’s name as a keyword and then
having the  rst organization’s banner and URL displayed
when a search is done on that keyword.24

In Table 1, we summarize the main points of our description, showing some of the ways search engine designers
and operators commonly make choices about what to include in and exclude from their databases. These choices
are embedded in human-interpreted decision criteria, in
crawl heuristics, and in ranking algorithms.
Implications
We may wonder how all this affects the nature of Web
users’ experiences. Based on what we have learned so far
about the way search engines work, we would predict that
information seekers on the Web, whose experiences are
mediated through search engines, are most likely to  nd
popular, large sites whose designers have enough technical
savvy to succeed in the ranking game, and especially those
sites whose proprietors are able to pay for various means of
improving their site’s positioning. Seekers are less likely
to  nd less popular, smaller sites, including those that are
not supported by knowledgeable professionals. 25 When a
search does yield these sites, they are likely to have lower
prominence in rankings.
These predictions are, of course, highly general and will
vary considerably according to the keywords or phrases
with which a seeker initiates a search, and this, in turn,
is likely to be affected by the seeker’s competence with
search engines. The nature of experiences of information
seekers will also vary according to the search engines
they choose. Some users may actively seek one search
engine over others, but some will simply, and perhaps

176

L. D. INTRONA AND H. NISSENBAUM

unknowingly, use a default engine provided by institutions or Internet service providers (ISPs ).26 We are unlikely to  nd much relief from these robust irregularities in
meta search engines like Metacrawler, Ask Jeeves, and Debrie ng because they base their results on existing search
engines and normally accomplish their task by recognizing only higher-order search keys rather than  rst-order
engines. 27 We note further that not only are most users
unaware of these particular biases, they seem also to be
unaware that they are unaware.
SHOULD WE LET THE MARKET DECIDE?
Readers may  nd little to trouble them in this description
of search engine proclivities. What we have before us is an
evolving marketplace in search engines: We ought to let
producers of search engines do what they will and let users
decide freely which they like best. Search engines whose
offerings are skewed either because their selections are not
comprehensive or because they prioritize listings according to highest bid will suffer in the marketplace. And even
if they do not, the collective preferences of participants
should not be second-guessed. As the representatives of
Yahoo! we cited earlier have argued, users’ reactions must
remain the benchmark of quality: Dissatis ed seekers will
defect from an inadequate search engine to another that
does a better job of indexing and prioritizing. Thus will
the best search engines  ourish; the poor ones will fade
away due to lack of use. McChesney (1997b, p.12 ) describes a comparable faith in the market mechanism as
it applied to traditional broadcast media: “In the United
States, the notion that commercial broadcasting is the superior system because it embodies market principles is
closely attached to the notion that the market is the only
‘democratic’ regulatory mechanism, and that this democratic market is the essence of Americanism, patriotism,
and all that is good and true in the world.” Both McChesney (1999 ) and Schiller (1995 ), however, have criticized
the idea that a media market best represents democratic
ideals. In the case of search engines, we are, likewise, not
optimistic about the promise of development that is shaped
only by a marketplace.
As anyone who has used search engines knows, the
dominant search engines do not charge seekers for the
search service. Rather, the arrangement resembles that
of commercial television where advertisers pay television
stations for the promise of viewers. Similarly, search engines attract paid advertisements based on the promise of
search usage. High usage, presumably, garners advertisers
and high charges. To succeed, therefore, search engines
must establish a reputation for satisfying seekers’ desires
and needs; this way they will attract seekers in the  rst
place, and then will keep them coming back.28 As a way
of simplifying the discussion, however, we refer to the mar-

ketplace as a marketplace in search engines with seekers as
the buyers. This strategy does not, as far as we have been
able to tell, alter the substantive outcomes of the particular
issues we have chosen to highlight.
We do not dispute the basic fact of the matter, namely
that a marketplace for search engines (and seekers, if you
will ) is possible. It is also possible that such a market,
re ecting discrepant degrees of satisfaction by seekers,
will result in some search engines  ourishing and others
failing. Our dissatisfaction with this forecast is not that
it cannot come true but what it would mean, from the
perspective of social values and the social investment in
the Internet, if it did. Why, the critic might ask, on what
grounds, would we presume to override the wishes of users
so as they are cleanly re ected in their market choices?
Our reply to this challenge, which we try to keep as free
from sentimental prejudices as possible, cites two main
sources of concern. One is that the conditions needed for
a marketplace to function in a democratic and ef cient
way are simply not met in the case of search engines. The
other is our judgment that Web-search mechanisms are
too important to be shaped by the marketplace alone. We
discuss each in turn, the  rst one only brie y.
A virtue frequently claimed by defenders of the market mechanism is that participants are free to express their
preferences through the choices they make among alternatives. Through their choices, incompetent inef cient suppliers are eliminated in favor of competent, ef cient suppliers. As many critics have pointed out, however, this holds
true only for markets in which those who supply goods
or services have an equal opportunity to enter the market
and communicate with potential customers, and in which
those who demand goods and services are fully informed
and act in a rational manner. Such an ideal market simply
does not exist, and this is especially so in the case of search
engines.
If we focus on the demand side  rst, we see that most
users of the Web lack critical information about alternatives. Only a small fraction of users understand how search
engines work and by what means they yield their results. It
is misleading to suggest that these users are meaningfully
expressing preferences or exercising free choice when they
select from the alternatives. Though we lack systematic
empirical evidence, the anecdotal results of asking people why they use or prefer one search engine to others
is some version of “It  nds what I’m looking for” and a
shrug. Now, if one is searching for a speci c product or
service, it may be possible to know in advance how to
determine that one has indeed found what one was looking for. When searching for information, however, it is
dif cult (if not impossible ) to make such a conclusive assessment, since the locating of information also serves to
inform one about that which one is looking for. This is
an old information-retrieval problem—often expressed as

POLITICS OF SEARCH ENGINES

“how do you know what you do not know until you know
it”—with which information science scholars have been
battling for many years. It seems unlikely that this would
be different for search engines. In fact, the partiality of any
search attempt (even if we assume a competent searcher )
will magnify this problem in the context of search engines.
Not only this, we would also claim that users tend to be
ignorant about the inherent partiality present in any search
engine search results (as explained earlier, in the technical overview ). They tend to treat search-engine results the
way they treat the results of library catalogue searches.
Given the vastness of the Web, the close guarding of algorithms, and the abstruseness of the technology to most
users, it should come as no surprise that seekers are unfamiliar, even unaware, of the systematic mechanisms that
drive search engines. Such awareness, we believe, would
make a difference. Although here, too, we came across
no systematic empirical  ndings, we note that in spheres
outside of the electronic media, people draw clear and
de nitive distinctions between information and recommendations coming from disinterested, as compared with
interested, sources, between impartial advice as compared
with advertisement. 29 And anecdotal experience bears this
out, as when customers learned that Amazon Books, for
example, had been representing as “friendly recommendations” what were in reality paid advertisements. Customers
responded with great ire, and Amazon hastily retreated.
The problem is equally complex on the supply side of the
supposed market. We have already indicated the complex
hurdles that need to be cleared to get listed and ranked appropriately. They all indicate that there simply is no level
playing  eld by any stretch of the imagination. It seems
clear that the “market will decide” view (problematic in
most cases ) is extremely problematic in this context. It is
also doubtful that this can be resolved to the point where
the market argument will become valid.
The question of whether a marketplace in search engines
suf ciently approximates a competitive free market is, perhaps, subordinate to the question of whether we ought to
leave the shaping of search mechanisms to the marketplace
in the  rst place. We think this would be a bad idea.
Developments in Web searching are shaped by two distinct forces. One is the collective preferences of seekers.
In the current, commercial model, search engines wishing
to achieve greatest popularity would tend to cater to majority interests. While markets undoubtedly would force
a degree of comprehensiveness and objectivity in listings,
there is unlikely to be much market incentive to list sites
of interest to small groups of individuals, such as individuals interested in rare animals or objects, individuals
working in narrow and specialized  elds or, for that matter, individuals of lesser economic power, and so forth. But
popularity with seekers is not the only force at play. The
other is the force exerted by entities wishing to be found.

177

Here, there is enormous inequality. Some enter the market already wielding vastly greater prowess and economic
power than others. The rich and powerful clearly can in uence the tendencies of search engines; their dollars can
(and in a restricted way do already ) play a decisive a role in
what gets found. For example, of the top 100 sites—based
on traf c—just 6 are not .com commercial sites. 30 If we
exclude universities, NASA, and the U.S. government, this
number drops to two. One could reasonably argue that the
United Nations site ought to generate at least enough traf c
to be on the list if we consider that Amazon is in position
10 and USA Today in position 35. The cost to a search
engine of losing a small number of searching customers
may be outweighed by the bene ts of pandering to “the
masses” and to entities paying fees for the various forms of
enhanced visibility. We can expect, therefore, that at least
some drift will be caused by those wishing to be found,
which, in turn, would further narrow the  eld of what is
available to seekers of information, association, support,
and services. 31
It may be useful to think of the Web as a market of
markets, instead of as just one market. When we seek, we
are not interested in information in general; rather, we are
interested in speci c information related to our speci c
interests and needs. Seekers might be in the market for
information about, for example, packaged tour holidays
or computer hardware suppliers. For these markets, where
we expect the demand for information to be great, we
would expect the competition for recognition to be great
as well. Companies would pay high prices for the keyword
banners that will ensure them the top spot and a search
will generate many hits for the seekers. In contrast, there
are other, signi cantly smaller markets—for information
about a rare medical condition or about the services of a
local government authority or community.
In this market of markets, there is likely to be little
incentive to ensure inclusion of these small markets and
only a small cost (in loss of participation ) for their exclusion. Although we do not have empirical evidence, we
would expect the law of Pareto to apply (see Sen, 1985 ).
We could imagine that a high percentage of search requests (say 80%, for argument’s sake ) are directed to a
small percentage (say 20% ) of the big markets, which
would be abundantly represented in search results. 32 Only
a small percentage of the search requests (say 20% ) might
be addressed to the large percentage (say 80% ) of the
smaller markets, which would be underrepresented. This
scenario would explain the limited incentive for inclusion
and relatively low cost of exclusion. We  nd this result
problematic.
A market enthusiast does not  nd this result problematic. This is exactly what the market is supposed to do; the
range and nature of choices are supposed to ebb and  ow
in response to the ebb and  ow of the wants and needs of

178

L. D. INTRONA AND H. NISSENBAUM

market participants— from varieties of salad dressings to
makes of automobiles. Nevertheless, we resist this conclusion not because we are suspicious of markets in general—
for cars and salad dressings, they are  ne—but because
maintaining the variety of options on the Web is of special
importance. We resist the conclusion because we think that
the value of comprehensive, thorough, and wide-ranging
access to the Web lies within the category of goods that
Elizabeth Anderson describes in her book Values in Ethics
and Economic as goods that should not be left entirely (if
at all ) to the marketplace (Anderson, 1993 ).
Anderson constructs an elaborate argument defending
the claim that there are ethical limitations on the scope
of market norms for a range of goods (and services ). Abstracting principles from cases that are likely to be noncontroversial in this regard—for example, friendship, persons,
and political goods (like the vote )—she then argues that
these principles apply to goods that are likely to be more
controversial in this regard, such as public spaces, artistic
endeavor, addictive drugs, and reproductive capacities. For
some goods, such as cars, bottled salad dressings, and so
on, “unexamined wants,” expressed through the marketplace, are a perfectly acceptable basis for distribution. For
others, including those that Anderson identi es, market
norms do not properly express the valuations of a liberal
democratic society like ours, which is committed to “freedom, autonomy and welfare” (Anderson, 1993, p. 141 ).
Although it is not essential to our position that we uncritically accept the whole of Anderson’s analysis, we accept
at least this: that there are certain goods—ones that Anderson calls “political goods,” including among them schools
and public places—that must be distributed not in accordance with market norms but “in accordance with public
principles” (Anderson, 1993, p. 159 ).
Sustaining the 80% of small markets that would be neglected by search engines shaped by market forces quali es as a task worthy of public attention. Sustaining a full
range of options here is not the same as sustaining a full
range of options in bottled salad dressings or cars because
the former enriches the democratic arena, may serve fundamental interests of many of the neediest members of our
society, and more (on which we elaborate in the next section ). We make political decisions to save certain goods
that might fall by the wayside in a purely market-driven
society. In this way, we recognize and save national treasures, historic homes, public parks, schools, and so forth.
In this spirit, we commit to serving groups of people, like
the disabled, even though (and because ) we know that a
market mechanism would not cater to their needs. (We
make special accommodation for nonpro t efforts through
tax exemption without consideration for popularity. ) We
see an equivalent need in the case of search engines.
In order to make the case convincing, however, we need
to introduce into the picture a substantive claim, because
our argument against leaving search engines fully to the

mercy of the marketplace is not based on formal grounds—
or at least, we do not see them. We base our case against
leaving it to the market on the particular function that we
see search engines serving and on the substantive vision
of the Web that we think search engines (and search-andretrieval mechanisms more generally ) ought to sustain. We
do not argue unconditionally that the trajectory of search
engine development is wrong or politically dangerous in
itself, but rather that it undermines a particular, normative
vision of the Web in society. Those who do not share in this
vision are unlikely to be convinced that search engines are
different (in kind ) from salad dressings and automobiles.
The case that search engines are a special, political good
presumes that the Web, too, is a special good.
THE FUTURE OF THE WEB AS A PUBLIC GOOD33
The thesis we here elaborate is that search engines, functioning in the manner outlined earlier, raise political concerns not simply because of the way they function, but also
because the way they function seems to be at odds with
the compelling ideology of the Web as a public good. This
ideology portrays the fundamental nature and ethos of the
Web as a public good of a particular kind, a rich array of
commercial activity, political activity, artistic activity, associations of all kinds, communications of all kinds, and
a virtually endless supply of information. In this regard
the Web was, and is still seen by many as, a democratic
medium that can circumvent the hegemony of the traditional media market, even of government control.
Over the course of a decade or so, computerized networks—the Internet and now the Web—have been envisioned as a great public good. Those who have held and
promoted this vision over the course of, perhaps, a decade
have based their claims on a combination of what we have
already achieved and what the future promises. For example, with only a fraction of the population in the United
States linked to the Internet, Al Gore (1995 ) promoted
the vision of a Global Internet Infrastructure. This conception of the great public good—part reality, part wishful
thinking— has gripped people from a variety of sectors, including scholars, engineers and scientists, entrepreneurs,
and politicians. Each has highlighted a particular dimension of the Web’s promise, some focusing on information,
some on communication, some on commerce, and so on.
Although we cannot enumerate here all possible public
bene ts, we highlight a few.
A theme that is woven throughout most versions of the
promise is that the Web contributes to the public good by
serving as a special kind of public space. The Web earns
its characterization as public in many of the same ways
as other spaces earn theirs, and it contributes to the public good for many of the same reasons. One feature that
pushes something into the realm we call public is that it is
not privately owned. The Web does seem to be public in

POLITICS OF SEARCH ENGINES

this sense: Its hardware and software infrastructure is not
wholly owned by any person or institution or, for that matter, by any single nation. Arguably, it does not even come
under the territorial jurisdiction of any existing sovereign
state.34 There is no central or located clearinghouse that
speci es or vets content or regulates overall who has the
right of access. All those who accept the technical protocols, conform to technical standards (HTML, for example ), and are able to connect to it may enter the Web. They
may access others on the Web and, unless they take special
precautions, they may be accessed. When I post my Web
pages, I may make them available to any of the millions of
potential browsers, even if, like a street vendor, I decide to
charge a fee for entry to my page. The collaborative nature
of much of the activity on the Web leads to a sense of the
Web’s being not simply unowned but collectively owned.
The Web ful lls some of the functions of other traditional public spaces—museums, parks, beaches, and
schools. It serves as a medium for artistic expression, a
space for recreation, and a place for storing and exhibiting
items of historical and cultural importance, and it can educate. Beyond these functions, the one that has earned it
greatest approbation both as a public space and a political
good is its capacity as a medium for intensive communication among and between individuals and groups in just
about all the permutations that one can imagine, namely,
one-to-one, one-to-many, etc. It is the Hyde Park Corner
of the electronic age, the public square where people may
gather as a mass or associate in smaller groups. They may
talk and listen, they may plan and organize. They air viewpoints and deliberate over matters of public importance.
Such spaces, where content is regulated only by a few fundamental rules, embody the ideals of the liberal democratic
society.
The idea of the Web as a public space and a forum for
political deliberation has fueled discussions on teledemocracy for some time (Abramson et al., 1988; Arterton, 1987 ).
The notion of the public sphere as a forum in which communicatively rational dialogue can take place unsullied
by ideology has had one of its strongest proponents in
Habermas (1989 ). Although there is no universal agreement among scholars on the extent of the effect the Web
may have in the political sphere, several contributors to the
debate have cited cases in which the Web appears to have
had a decisive impact on the outcome. Douglas Kellner
(1997 ) gives some examples: Zapatistas in their struggle
against the Mexican government, the Tiananmen Square
democracy movement, environmental activists who exposed McDonald’s through the McLibel campaign, and the
Clean Clothes Campaign supporting attempts of Filipino
garment workers to expose exploitative working conditions.
We have not yet mentioned the perhaps dominant reason for conceiving of the Web as a public good, namely,
its function as a conveyor of information. As a public

179

means of access to vast amounts of information, the Web
promises widespread bene ts. In this so-called information age, being among the information-rich is considered to
be so important that some, like the philosopher Jeroen van
den Hoven (1994, 1998 ), have argued that it makes sense
to construe access to information as one of the Rawlsian
“primary goods,” compelling any just society to guarantee
a basic, or reasonable, degree of it to all citizens. Growing
use of the Web as a repository for all manner of information
(e.g., government documents, consumer goods, scienti c
and artistic works, local public announcements, etc. ) lends
increasing weight to this prescription. The Web, according
to the vision, is not intended as a vehicle for further expanding the gap between haves and have-nots, but for narrowing
it (see, e.g., Civille, 1996; Hoffman & Novak, 1998 ).
The view of the Internet as a public good, as a globally inclusive, popular medium, fueled much of the initial social and economic investment in the medium and
its supporting technology, convincing progressive politicians (or those who wish to appear progressive ) to support
it with investment and political backing. 35 The vision has
also motivated idealistic computer scientists and engineers
to volunteer energy and expertise toward developing and
promulgating the hardware and software, from the likes
of Jonathan Postel, one of the early builders of the Internet, who worked to keep its standards open and free,36
to professionals and researchers volunteering in efforts to
wire schools and help build infrastructure in poorer nations. These inclusive values were very much in the minds
of creators of the Web like Tim Berners-Lee:
The universality of the Web includes the fact that the information space can represent anything from one’s personal
private jottings to a polished global publication. We as people
can, with or without the Web, interact on all scales. By being involved on every level, we ourselves form the ties which
weave the levels together into a sort of consistency, balancing
the homogeneity and the heterogeneity, the harmony and the
diversity. We can be involved on a personal, family, town, corporate, state, national, union, and international levels. Culture
exists at all levels, and we should give it a weighted balanced
respect at each level.37

While the promise of the Web as a public space and a
public good continues to galvanize general, political, and
commercial support, many observers and scholars have
cautioned that the goods are not guaranteed. The bene ts
of the vast electronic landscape, the billions of gigabytes
of information, and the participation of millions of people
around the world depend on a number of contingencies. Issuing one such caution, Lewis Branscomb (1996 ) calls for
political effort to protect public interests against encroaching commercial interests. He worries about the enormous
amount of money “invested in the new business combinations to exploit this consumer information market; the
dollars completely swamp the modest investments being

180

L. D. INTRONA AND H. NISSENBAUM

made in bringing public services to citizens and public
institutions” (p. 27 ), urging federal, state, and local government to “develop and realize the many non-pro t public
service applications necessary for the realization of the
‘promise of NII’” (p. 31 ).
Gary Chapman and Marc Rotenberg, writing in 1993
on behalf of the organization Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, listed a number of problems that
would need to be solved before the National Information
Infrastructure would be capable of serving the public interest. Of particular relevance to us here is Chapman and
Rotenberg’s reference to Marvin Sirbu’s (1992 ) call for
“Development of standardized methods for information
 nding: White Pages directories, Yellow Pages, information indexes.” Without an effective means of  nding what
you need, the bene ts of an information and communication infrastructure like the Web are signi cantly diminished. We can conjure up analogies: a library containing all
the printed books and papers in the world without covers
and without a catalogue; a global telephone network without a directory; a magni cent encyclopedia, haphazardly
organized and lacking a table of contents.
Search engines are not the only answer to this need,
but they still are the most prominent, the one to which
most users turn when they want to explore new territory on
the Web. The power, therefore, that search engines wield
in their capacity to highlight and emphasize certain Web
sites, while making others, essentially, disappear, is considerable. If search engines systematically highlight Web
sites with popular appeal and mainstream commercial purpose, as well as Web sites backed by entrenched economic
powers, they amplify these presences on the Web at the expense of others. Many of the neglected venues and sources
of information, suffering from lack of traf c, perhaps actually disappear, further narrowing the options to Web
participants.
If trends in the design and function of search engines
lead to a narrowing of options on the Web—an actual narrowing or a narrowing in what can be located—the Web
as a public good of the particular kind that many envisioned is undermined. The ideal Web serves all people,
not just some, not merely those in the mainstream. It is
precisely the inclusivity and breadth that energized many
to think that this technology would mean not just business
as usual in the electronic realm, not merely a new tool for
entrenched views and powers. The ideal Web would extend
the possibilities for association, would facilitate access to
obscure sources of information, would give voice to many
of the typically unheard, and would preserve intensive and
broadly inclusive interactivity.
In considering the effects of a biased indexing and retrieval system, our attention  rst was drawn to the seekers.
It is from the perspective of seekers that we noted the systematic narrowing of Web offerings: There would be fewer

opportunities to locate various types of information, individuals, and organizations, a narrowing of the full range
of deliberative as well as recreational capabilities. If access to the Web is understood as access by seekers to all
of these resources, then the outcome of biased search engines amounts to a shrinking of access to the Web. This
perspective, however, does not represent all that is at stake.
At stake is access to the Web in the shape of those, in addition, who would like to be found, to be seen and heard.
Marc Raboy describes this dimensions of the new medium:
The notion of “access” has traditionally meant different
things in broadcasting and in telecommunications. In the
broadcasting model, emphasis is placed on the active receiver,
on free choice, and access refers to the entire range of products on offer. In the telecommunications model, emphasis is
on the sender, on the capacity to get one’s messages out, and
access refers to the means of communication. In the new media environment, public policy will need to promote a new
hybrid model of communication, which combines the social
and cultural objectives of both broadcasting and telecommunications, and provides new mechanisms—drawn from both
traditional models—aimed at maximizing equitable access to
services and the means of communication for both senders
and receivers (Raboy, 1998, p. 224).

The public good of the Web lies not merely in its functioning as a repository for seekers to  nd things, but as
a forum for those with something (goods, services, viewpoints, political activism, etc. ) to offer. The cost of a biased
search-and-retrieval mechanism may even be greater for
Web-site owners wishing to be found—the senders. Consider an example of just one type of case, someone seeking
information about, say, vacation rentals in the Fiji Islands.
Because one rental is all the person needs, he or she is likely
to look down a list of options and stop looking when he or
she  nds it. There is no loss to the seeker even if it turns out
that lower down on the list there are many other candidates
meeting his or her criteria. The seeker has found what he or
she needs. Those who are not found (because their lower
ranking deprives them of attention or recognition ) are offering, arguably, just as much value to the seeker. Our loss,
in this case is twofold: One is that if continuing invisibility causes options to atrophy, the  eld of opportunity is
thinned; the other is that many of those reaching out for
attention or connection are not being served by the Web.
If search mechanisms systematically narrow the scope of
what seekers may  nd and what sites may be found, they
will diminish the overall value of the Web as a public forum
and as a broadly inclusive source of information.
Many have observed that to realize the vision of the
Web as a democratizing technology or, more generally, as a
public good, we must take the question of access seriously.
We agree with this sentiment but wish to expand what the
term covers. Access involves not merely a computer and

POLITICS OF SEARCH ENGINES

a network hookup, as some have argued, nor, in addition,
the skills and know-how that enable effective use. Access
implies a comprehensive mechanism for  nding and being
found. It is in this context that we raise the issue of the
politics of search engines—a politics that at present seems
to push the Web into a drift that does not resonate with one
of the historically driving ideologies. 38 We also believe we
have shown why a rally to the market will not save the day,
will not ensure our grand purpose. The question of how to
achieve it is far harder.
SOME CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
We have claimed that search-engine design is not only a
technical matter but also a political one. Search engines
are important because they provide essential access to the
Web both to those with something to say and offer and to
those wishing to hear and  nd. Our concern is with the
evident tendency of many of the leading search engines to
give prominence to popular, wealthy, and powerful sites at
the expense of others. This they do through the technical
mechanisms of crawling, indexing, and ranking algorithms
as well as through human-mediated trading of prominence
for a fee. As long as this tendency continues, we expect
these political effects will become more acute as the Web
expands.
We regret this tendency not because it goes against our
personal norms of fair play but because it undermines a
substantive ideal—the substantive vision of the Web as an
inclusive democratic space. This ideal Web is not merely a
new communications infrastructure offering greater bandwidth, speed, massive connectivity, and more, but also a
platform for social justice. It promises access to the kind
of information that aids upward social mobility; it helps
people make better decisions about politics, health, education, and more. The ideal Web also facilitates associations
and communication that could empower and give voice to
those who, traditionally, have been weaker and ignored.
A drift toward popular, commercially successful institutions, through the partial view offered by search engines,
seriously threatens these prospects. Scrutiny and discussion are important responses to these issues but policy and
action are also needed—to  ll that half-empty portion of
the cup. We offer preliminary suggestions, calling for a
combination of regulation through public policy as well
as value-conscious design innovation.
The tenor of our suggestions is enhancement. We do not
see that regulating and restricting development of commercial search engines is likely to produce ends that we would
value—as it were, siphoning off from the half-full portion.
This course of action is likely to be neither practically appealing nor wise, and might smack of cultural elitism or
paternalism. Amartya Sen (1987, p. 9 ), commenting on
existing schools of thought within the  eld of economics,

181

wrote: “It is not my purpose to write off what has been or is
being achieved, but de nitely to demand more.” We take
a similar stance in response to our study of Web search
engines.
Policy
As a  rst step we would demand full and truthful disclosure of the underlying rules (or algorithms ) governing
indexing, searching, and prioritizing, stated in a way that
is meaningful to the majority of Web users. Obviously,
this might help spammers. However, we would argue that
the impact of these unethical practices would be severely
dampened if both seekers and those wishing to be found
were aware of the particular biases inherent in any given
search engine. We believe, on the whole, that informing
users will be better than the status quo, in spite of the
dif culties. Those who favor a market mechanism would
perhaps be pleased to note that disclosure would move
us closer to ful lling the criteria of an ideal competitive
market in search engines. Disclosure is a step in the right
direction because it would lead to a clearer grasp of what
is at stake in selecting among the various search engines,
which in turn should help seekers to make informed decisions about which search engines to use and trust. But
disclosure by itself may not sustain and enhance Web offerings in the way we would like it to—that is, by retaining
transparency for those less popular sites to promote inclusiveness.
The marketplace alone, as we have argued, is not adequate. As a policy step, we might, for example, consider
public support for developing more egalitarian and inclusive search mechanisms and for research into search
and meta-search technologies that would increase transparency and access. Evidently, if we leave the task of charting the Web in the hands of commercial interests alone, we
will merely mirror existing asymmetries of power in the
very structure of the Web (McChesney, 1999 ). Although
these and other policies could promise a fairer representation of Web offerings, a second key lies in the technology
itself.
Values in Design
Philosophers of technology have recognized the intricate
connection between technology and values—social, political, and moral values. 39 These ideas—that technological
systems may embed or embody values—resonate in social and political commentary on information technology
written by engineers as well as by philosophers and experts in cyberlaw (see, e.g., Friedman, 1997; Lessig, 1999;
Nissenbaum, 1998 ). Translating these ideas into practice
implies that we can build better systems—that is to say,
systems that better re ect important social values—if we

182

L. D. INTRONA AND H. NISSENBAUM

build them with an explicit commitment to values. With
this article, the commitment we hope to inspire among
the designers and builders of search engine technology is
a commitment to the value of fairness as well as to the
suite of values represented by the ideology of the Web as
a public good.
Two technical approaches that appear to be attracting
interest are not without drawbacks. One would increase
segmentation and diversi cation. Search engines would
become associated with particular segments of society—
borders drawn perhaps according to traditional categories
(sports, entertainment, art, and so forth ). A problem with
segmentation overall, however, is that it could fragment
the very inclusiveness and universality of the Web that we
value. The Web may eventually merely mirror the institutions of society with its baggage of asymmetrical power
structures, privilege, and so forth.
The other approach is to develop individualized spiders
that go out and search for pages based on individual criteria, building individualized databases according to individual needs. 40 There is, however, a signi cant “cost”
in automatic harvesting via spiders that even the existing
population of spiders imposes on system resources; this
has already caused concern (see Kostner, 1995 ).
There is much interesting work under way concerning
the technology of search engines that could, in principle,
help: for example, improving the way individual pages
indicate relevance (also referred to as metadata ) (see Marchiori, 1998 ), re ning overall search engine technology,41
and improving Web resource presentation and visualization (see Hearst, 1997 ) and meta-search technology (see
Lawrence & Giles, 1998 ). Although improvements like
these might accidentally promote values, they hold greatest promise as remedies for the current politics of search
engines if they are explicitly guided by values. We urge
engineers and scientists who adhere to the ideology of
the Web, to its values of inclusivity, fairness, and scope
of representation, and so forth, to pursue improvements
in indexing, searching, accessing, and ranking with these
values  rmly in their sights. It is good to keep in mind
that the struggle to chart the Web and capture the attention of the information seekers is not merely a technical
challenge, it is also political.

NOTES
1. In an online survey the NDP Group polled 22,000 seekers who
accessed search engines to determine their satisfaction with the search
engine. Ninety-six percent (96%) indicated that they were satis ed
with the search results. This would seem to go against our argument.
However, in another study done by researchers from British Telecom
(BT), PC-literate but not regular users of the Internet found their search
results disappointing and generally “not worth the effort” (Pollock &
Hockley, 1997). This may indicate that a fairly high level of searching

skill is necessary to get what you want. We return to this issue when we
discuss the market argument for the development of search engines.
2. Winner, L. 1980. Do artifactshave politics? Daedalus 109:121 –
136.
3. For those interested in more detail, the Web site http://www.
searchenginewatch.com is a good place to start.
4. We are thinking here of the top 10 to 20 when it is a matter of
actual relevancy. We later discuss the issue of spamming.
5. One could argue that it is also possible for a Web page to be
found through portal sites, which are increasingly popular, though as a
matter of fact, we think it would be highly unlikely that a link would be
established through a portal site if it does not meet the indexing criteria
for search engines.
6. We realize we have not listed all the means through which
pages may be found. For example, one may access a page through
an outlink from another page. The problem with such means is that
they depend on somewhat unpredictable serendipity. One needs also
to add that increasing numbers of alternatives are emerging as viable
options, such as portal sites and keyword retrieval via Centraal’s Real
Name system (http://www.centraal.com). Nevertheless, the majority of
those who access the Web continue to do it through search engines.
There is no reason to believe that this would change in the foreseeable
future.
7. We note, for readers who are aware of the debate currently
raging over domain names, that an effective system of search and retrieval is a constructive response to the debate and would lessen the
impact of whatever decisions are made. We argue that domain names
are important in inverse proportion to the ef cacy of available search
mechanisms, for if individuals and institutions can easily be found on
the basis of content and relevancy, there is less at stake in the precise
formulation of their domain names. In other words, a highly effective
indexing and retrieval mechanism can mitigate the effects of domainname assignments.
8. A stop word is a frequently occurring word such as the, to, and
we that is excluded because it occurs too often. Stop words are not
indexed. This is not insigni cant if one considers that the word “web”
is a stop word in Alta Vista. So if you are a company doing Web design
and have “Web design” in your title, you may not get indexed and will
be ranked accordingly.
9. The <TITLE> tag is either created by the Web-page designer
or deduced by a converter. For example, when you create an MSWord
document and want to publish it on the Web, you can save it as HTML
directly in the MSWord editor. In this case the MSWord editor assumes
that the  rst sentence it can  nd in the document is the title and will
place this in the <TITLE> tag in the HTML source code it generates.
10. Most of the directory-based search engines also use some form
of automatic harvesting to augment their manually submitted
database.
11. When parsing the page, the spider views the page in HTML
format and treats it as one long string of words, as explained by Alta
Vista: “Alta Vista treats every page on the Web and every article of
Usenet news as a sequence of words. A word in this context means any
string of lettersand digits delimited either by punctuation and other nonalphabetic characters (for example, &, %, $, /, #, ¡ , » ), or by white
space (spaces, tabs, line ends, start of document, end of document).
To be a word, a string of alphanumerics does not have to be spelled
correctly or be found in any dictionary. All that is required is that
someone type it as a single word in a Web page or Usenet news article.
Thus, the following are words if they appear delimited in a document:

POLITICS OF SEARCH ENGINES
HAL5000, Gorbachevnik, 602e21, www, http, EasierSaidThanDone,
etc. The following are all considered to be two words because the
internal punctuation separates them: don’t, digital.com, x – y, AT&T,
3.14159, U.S., All’sFairInLoveAndWar.”
12. Page is one of the designers of Google, and the details presented
here are the heuristics used by Google (at least the earlier version of
these heuristics).
13. We are not claiming that this is a straightforward and uncontroversial metric. The decision about the “similarity” between the query
term and the document is by no means trivial. Decisions on how to implement the determination of “similarity” can indeed be of signi cance
to our discussion. However, we do not pursue this discussion here.
14. In the cases of Excite, Hotbot, and Lycos, there is evidence
that this is a major consideration for determining indexing appeal—
refer to http://www.searchenginwatch.com/webmasters/features.html.
Exclusion, using this metric, is less likely for a search engine like
Alta Vista, which goes for massive coverage, than for its smaller, more
selective competitors.
15. For search-engine operators it is a matter of deciding between
breadth and depth: Should many sites be partially indexed or few
sites fully indexed, since they know a priori that they can not include everything? (Brake, 1997) Louis Monier, in a response to John
Pike—Webmaster for the Federation of American Scientists site—
indicated that Alta Vista indexed 51,570 of the estimated 300,000
pages of the Geocities site. This amounts to approximately 17% coverage. He thought this to be exceptionally good. Pike indicated that
Alta Vista indexed 600 of their 6000 pages. (Refer to this discussion at
http://www4.zdnet.com/anchordesk/talkback/talkback 11638.html and
http://www4.zdnet.com/anchordesk/talkback/talkback 13066.html as
well as to the New Scientist paper at http://www.newscientist.com/
keysites/networld/lost.html. )
16. For a discussion of this standard, refer to http://info.webcrawler.
com/mak/projects/robots/exclusion.html.
17. Another reason for excluding spiders from sites such as CNN
is that their content is constantly in  ux and one does not want search
engines to index (and now cache) old content. Another issue worth
noting here is that many search engines now have large caches to go
along with their indexes.
18. Refer to the New Scientist paper at http://www.newscientist.com/
keysites/networld/lost.html. The “cost” of a spider visit can be significant for a site. Responsible spider will request a page only every so
many seconds. However, the pressure to index has induced what is
termed “rapid  re.” This means that the spider requests in rapid succession, which may make the server unavailable to any other user.
Although there is a danger that this problem will worsen, there seems
to be a generally optimistic view among experts that we will develop
technical mechanisms to deal with it, for example, proposals to devise
extensions to HTTP, or parallel spiders.
19. Although at present some spiders are unable to deal with features such as frames and are better with simple HTML  les, there are
spiders that have been developed that are now able to handle a variety
of formats.
20. Lee Giles disputes this. He still considers indexing to be a huge
problem.
21. Also referred to as spamdexing. Refer to http://www.jmls.edu/
cyber/index/metatags.html for a reasonable discussion of this issue.
22. “To stay ahead of the game, the major search engines change
their methods for determining relevancy rankings every few months.
This is usually when they discover that a lot of people have learned the
latesttechnique and are all sneaking into a side door. They also try to fool

183

the tricksters . . . sometimes they put irrelevant pages at the top of the list
just to cause confusion” (Patrick Anderson & Michael Henderson, editor & publisher, Hits To Sales, at http://www.hitstosales.com/2search.
html).
23. At the WWW7 Conference, researchers in Australia devised
an ingenious method for attempting to reverse-engineer the relevanceranking algorithms of various commercial search engines, causing consternation and some outrage—see Pringle et al. (1998).
24. Lawsuits have been  led by Playboy Enterprises, Inc., and Estee Lauder Companies, Inc., challenging such arrangements between
Excite, Inc., and other companies that have “bought” their respective
names for purposes of banner ads. See Kaplan (1999).
25. “If you want the traf c and the exposure, you are going to pay
for the education or you are going to pay for the service. There is no
other way to do it. It is not easy. It is not magic. It takes time, effort, and
knowledge. Then it takes continual monitoring to keep the position you
worked so hard to get in the  rst place. Please do not misunderstand—
the competition is  erce and severe for those top spots, which is why
the search engines can charge so much money to sell keyword banners”
(Anderson & Henderson, 1997, emphasis added).
26. Some large sites (universities, for example) allow users to submit keywords, which the site, in turn, submits to a particular default
search engine (frequently Yahoo!). If users select “search” on the
Netscape toolbar it takes them to the Netscape Web pages where they
have a list of search engines. In this case Excite is the default search
engine. There is clearly considerable advantage to being chosen as the
default search engine on the Netscape or other equivalent Web page.
27. This is because, as Giles and Lawrence remarked in verbal consultation, there is a fair degree of convergence in the results yielded by
various search engine algorithms and decision criteria.
28. One should also note that search engines also market themselves aggressively. They also establish agreements with other service
providers to become defaults on their pages. Refer to footnote 26.
29. As noted by one of the reviewers, this is equally true outside
the electronic media.
30. Refer to http://www.100hot.com for the latest list.
31. And engines that use link popularity for priority listing will be
even more prone to reifying a mode of conservatism on the Web.
32. This guess is not far from reality, as searches for sex-related
key terms are by far the most frequent—constituting perhaps as high a
percentage as 80% of overall searches.
33. Our discussion of the Web would probably be more accurately
addressed to the Internet as a whole. We think that the more inclusive
discussion would only strengthen our conclusions but would probably
introduce unnecessary complexity.
34. See Johnson and Post (1996). This article puts forward an extreme version of this view. We will not engage further in the debate.
35. Popular news media re ect the hold of this vision of the Web.
In an article in The New York Times about the Gates Learning Foundation’s recent donation for public-access computers to libraries, the
gift is discussed in terms of bridging economic inequality and overcoming technical illiteracy. Librarians are quoted as enthusiastically
reporting that the computers are used “to type (their) resumes, hunt for
jobs, do schoolwork, research Beanie Babies, look up medical information, investigate their family roots, send E-mail and visit wrestling
sites on the web” (Katie Hafner, The New York Times, 21 February
1999).

York Times, 22 October 1998.

41. Some cite Google as an example. This is a particularly interesting case, as Google started out as a search engine that was developed
within an educational setting and moved into the for-pro t sector. We
think it would be very worthwhile to trace changes in the technology
that might result from this move.
