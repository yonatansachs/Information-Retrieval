Abstract 
The research examines the accessibility of museums in Istanbul for people with disabilities. The 
aim is to determine the suitability of museums in Istanbul for individuals with physical, visual, 
and hearing impairments, identify the problems they encounter in museums, identify physical 
limitations, and develop solution proposals. The qualitative research method was used in the re-
search conducted in 2022-2023 covering museums in Istanbul. The research consists of two parts. 
In the first part, the museums to be visited were determined. Then, the checklists were submitted 
for approval to two expert academics. Opinions regarding the questions in the checklists were 
obtained by conducting a pilot study with six individuals with physical impairments, two with 
visual impairments, and two with hearing impairments. In the second part, the accessibility was 
evaluated by visiting 41 museums in Istanbul using checklists consisting of 23 questions. The 
findings were analyzed using the content analysis method. Considering the data of the research, 
none of the museums met the requirements for accessibility, museums were far from providing 
minimum standards for individuals with physical, visual, and hearing impairments, and individ-
uals with physical, visual, and hearing impairments were unable to visit museums due to inade-
quate physical conditions rather than financial constraints.

Öz 
Araştırmanın amacı İstanbul’da bulunan müzelerin engellilere yönelik erişilebilir ulaşılabilirliğin 
incelenmesidir. Bu doğrultuda İstanbul’da yer alan müzelerin bedensel, görme, işitme engelliler 
açısından uygunluklarının belirlenmesi, engellilerin müzelerde karşılaştıkları problemlerin ve 
müzelere ilişkin fiziki yetersizliklerin ortaya konması ve bunlara ilişkin çözüm önerilerinin geliş-
tirilmesi amaçlanmıştır. İstanbul’daki müzeleri kapsayan ve 2022-2023 yılında gerçekleştirilen 
araştırmada nitel araştırma yöntemi kullanılmıştır. Araştırma iki kısımdan oluşmaktadır. İlk kıs-
mında İstanbul’da yer alan ve ziyaret edilecek müzeler belirlenmiştir. Ardından müzelerin erişi-
lebilir ulaşılabilirliğini belirlemede kullanılacak olan kontrol listeleri bedensel, görme, işitme en-
gellilerin eğitimleri konusunda uzman iki akademisyenin onayına sunulmuştur. Oluşturulan 
kontrol listeleri altı bedensel, iki görme ve iki işitme engelli bireyle bir müzede pilot çalışması ya-
pılarak müzelerin erişilebilir ulaşılabilirliğini belirlemede kullanılacak olan kontrol listelerinde yer 
alan soruların yeterliliğine ilişkin görüşleri alınmıştır. İkinci kısmında son şekli verilen 23 soru-
dan oluşan kontrol listeleri doğrultusunda İstanbul’da belirlenen 41 müze ziyaret edilerek engel-
lilere yönelik erişilebilir ulaşılabilirlik açısından değerlendirilmiştir. Elde edilen bulgular içerik 
analizi yöntemiyle incelenmiştir. İstanbul’da 41 müzede gerçekleştirilen araştırmanın verileri in-
celendiğinde, İstanbul’da yer alan hiçbir müzenin erişilebilir ulaşılabilirlik açısından sahip olması 
gereken şartları sağlamadığı, müzelerin bedensel, görme, işitme engellilere minimum asgari stan-
dartları sağlamada çok uzak oldukları, bunun yanı sıra bedensel, görme, işitme engellilerin maddi 
olanaksızlıktan çok fiziki şartların yetersizliğinden dolayı müze ziyaretleri gerçekleştiremedikleri 
ortaya konmuştur.

Museums! How Accessible for Individuals with Disabilities? 
 
     1495 
 
Introduction  
 
Museums have the characteristic of being spaces where memories of all 
lived experiences in a geography are collected, preserved, and transferred 
to the future. Museums are not merely structures where artworks are col-
lected, restored, documented, and displayed. They are vital spaces where 
social memory and lived experiences, as well as the cultural, philosophi-
cal, and vital accumulation of that geography, are transmitted. Museums 
are important institutions that bring together the past with today and to-
day with the future, allowing different layers of society to converge on 
common grounds, forming social consciousness, and indicating the deve-
lopmental trajectory of society. Therefore, the accessibility of museums is 
crucial because society, along with all its stakeholders, constitutes a whole. 
Consequently, in order to maintain this integrity, all stakeholders of soci-
ety must be able to benefit from the opportunities provided by the state 
under the same "freedom". In order to ensure this "freedom", museums 
need to be transformed into accessible and socio-culturally suitable spaces 
for the visitation of all segments of society. Thus, it is important to trans-
form all museums, regardless of whether they are disabled-friendly or not, 
into structures where all individuals can benefit under equal conditions 
and visit. Museums belong to the community, and are a common asset of 
individuals constituting society, which everyone from all segments of so-
ciety should benefit from. The concepts of "Accessible Museums" and 
"Museums for Everyone", adopted by many international and national 
institutions and civil society organizations since the year 2000, should not 
only remain theoretical but should also be reflected in practice through 
legal regulations and public awareness. Museums, whether they have bar-
riers or not, should be transformed into structures that everyone can easily 
visit, roam around, and benefit from, without the need for others' assis-
tance and without any issues of accessibility. Necessary efforts should be 
made as soon as possible to achieve this, which is also the requirement of 
being a social state and ensures that individuals forming the society can 
benefit from the state's resources under equal conditions. 
Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the extent to which mu-
seums are accessible for individuals with disabilities.

Method  
 
The aim of this study is to identify the problems encountered by individu-
als with physical, hearing, and visual impairments during museum visits, 
to highlight physical inadequacies related to museums, and to determine 
the degree of accessibility of museums for individuals with disabilities. 
In the selection of the disabled individuals in the study group, the fact 
that they reside in Istanbul province, apart from their disability status, was 
taken as a basis. Because Istanbul is the most populous city in Turkey and 
has a wide demographic structure. It offers a wide variety due to the dif-
ferent socio-economic, cultural and ethnic groups it hosts. This situation 
is important in terms of generalizing the findings of the study to a wider 
audience. In addition, disabled individuals residing in Istanbul or visiting 
Istanbul were preferred with the idea that Istanbul, as one of the cities 
with the most developed infrastructure in Turkey, would provide conve-
nience and logistical advantages in the data collection processes. 
The study included completely visually impaired (blind), physically 
disabled (wheelchair users) and hearing impaired (deaf) individuals. 
Visually impaired (blind), physically disabled (wheelchair users) and 
hearing impaired (deaf) individuals are one of the groups that face the 
most access barriers in museum experiences. Museums generally create 
more difficulties for visually impaired individuals in terms of access due 
to their visually-based content and exhibition methods. Therefore, the 
experiences of this group allow the clearest and most comprehensive as-
sessment of museum accessibility. Accessibility solutions developed for 
individuals with vision loss (tactile guides, audio narrations, Braille labels, 
etc.) provide an effective method for measuring museums’ accessibility 
standards. Are these solutions sufficient, practical, and functional? 
Answering these questions becomes more meaningful with the feedback 
from this group. Data obtained from the experiences of individuals with 
complete vision loss can play a critical role in developing museums’ ac-
cessibility policies. Meeting the needs of these individuals will guide mu-
seums in expanding and developing their accessibility strategies. The dif-
ficulties experienced by individuals with complete vision loss in their mu-
seum experiences are an important indicator in terms of measuring whet-
her this right is fully realized. Studies on the museum experiences of indi-
viduals with visual impairments can help raise awareness of accessibility

both among museum managements and in society in general. This can en-
courage the widespread use of accessible museums. For this reason, it was 
preferred to include individuals with complete vision loss in the study. 
 
Research Problem 
There are over 1 billion individuals with disabilities worldwide, with 
approximately 10 million in Turkey, and this number is rapidly increasing 
every day. Therefore, removing the barriers to social, cultural, and social 
participation of this largest minority in the world and implementing regu-
lations in this regard are not just a legal requirement but also a moral ob-
ligation of humanity. With changing perceptions in the twenty-first cen-
tury, museums have evolved into socio-cultural institutions where diffe-
rent segments of society come together. Therefore, determining the acces-
sibility of museums for individuals with disabilities, who are important 
tools for socialization and developing a sense of belonging to the commu-
nity, is identified as the main problem of this research.   
 
Sub-Problems of the Research 
To what extent are museums accessible for individuals with disabili-
ties? 
• Determining the accessibility of museums for individuals with di-
sabilities, 
• Determining the usability of museums for individuals with disabi-
lities, 
• Assessing the suitability of museums for individuals with physical, 
visual, and hearing impairments, 
• Identifying the problems encountered by individuals with disabili-
ties in museums, 
• Identifying the physical inadequacies of museums for individuals 
with disabilities. 
 
Study Group/Population and Sample 
In this research aimed at determining the accessibility of museums for 
individuals with disabilities, a qualitative research method was emplo-
yed, and a general scanning model was conducted (Büyüköztürk et al., 
2008). 
The aim of the conducted study is to evaluate the accessibility of the 
museums in Istanbul for individuals with physical, hearing, and visual

impairments. Based on this problem, the study aims to determine the 
extent to which museums are suitable for individuals with visual, hearing, 
and physical disabilities, as well as to identify the common problems en-
countered during museum visits, and to uncover the physical inadequ-
acies of museums and factors affecting museum visits. The research was 
conducted between 2022-2023. Initially, the museums located in Istanbul 
that would be visited were identified.  
While determining the museums to be included in the study, the most 
visited museums in Istanbul were determined according to the lists of the 
Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Turkey, the Gover-
norship of Istanbul, TUİK and TURSAB, and the museums that could be 
reached with the “Convenient sampling” method were included in the 
study. The following criteria were taken into consideration when selecting 
the museums in Istanbul. These are; 
• Representation of diversity, 
• Accessibility practices, 
• Suitability for comprehensive research, 
• Location and ease of access, 
• Visitor density and popularity, 
• Physical and technical application possibilities. 
However; 
• Museums that repeated each other in the context of the exhibited 
works were eliminated (for example, 1 painting museum, 1 toy mu-
seum) 
- Convenient sampling method was used. 
• Easy Access 
• Resource Limitations 
• Practicality was taken as a basis. 
Then, the checklists to determine the accessibility of the museums were 
presented to two academics who are experts in the education of individu-
als with physical, visual, and hearing impairments for approval. Pilot stu-
dies were conducted with six individuals with physical disabilities, two 
with visual impairments, and two with hearing impairments in one mu-
seum to gather their opinions on the adequacy of the questions in the 
checklists to be used in determining the accessibility of the museums. In 
the second part, a total of 41 museums were visited in Istanbul, including 
16 private and 25 state museums, based on the finalized checklists consis-
ting of 23 questions. These checklists were used to evaluate the

accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The purposive sampling 
method was preferred as the sampling method in the study. The criterion 
chosen was that those individuals participating in the study and applying 
the checklists must have at least one museum visit experience (Yıldırım & 
Şimşek, 2011). The obtained findings were analyzed using the content 
analysis method.  
Information about the evaluated museums within the scope of the re-
search is shown in Table 1:

Data Collection Tools 
The research utilized the "How Accessible are Museums for Individu-
als with Disabilities?" scale. This scale was adapted from the "Practices of 
Museums in Izmir for Visually Impaired Individuals" scale used in the 
study "The Silent and Dark World of Museums: Is "Museums for All" Pos-
sible?" by Hülya Yeşilyurt, Burçin Kırlar, and Ceyda Lale. The research is 
qualitative and consists of 23 questions answered in a yes or no format. A 
total of 41 museums were examined, including 16 private and 25 state mu-
seums. The study was conducted between November 2022 and February 
2023 in the districts of Beyoğlu, Fatih, Beşiktaş, Şişli, Çatalca, Beykoz, Bey-
likdüzü, Üsküdar, Bakırköy, Kadıköy, Balat, Zeytinburnu, and Sarıyer in 
Istanbul Province.

Results 
The findings of the research were collected in terms of supply and de-
mand, categorized into subcategories following similar studies in the lite-
rature, and presented in tables. There are a total of 91 museums in Istanbul 
Province. Of these museums, 19 are affiliated with the Ministry of Culture 
and Tourism, 12 belong to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, 3 are 
under the Turkish Armed Forces, 4 are under the Directorate General of 
Foundations, 9 belong to the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, 9 belong 
to universities and other state institutions, and 35 have private museum 
status. Between November 2022 and February 2023, a total of 41 museums 
were examined, including 16 private and 25 state museums. The findings 
obtained are presented in Table 2.

When Table 2 is examined, it is observed that none of the museums 
evaluated in the research met the criteria for individuals with physical, 
hearing, and visual impairments. Only one museum had tactile surface 
covering; one museum had touchable replicas for visually impaired indi-
viduals; in nineteen museums, the display cases where the artifacts were 
exhibited were not sharp-cornered and did not pose a danger; and in 
twelve museums, the audio descriptions of the artifacts were available.

Upon examining Table 3, it is observed that none of the museums eva-
luated in the study kept statistics for visitors with physical, hearing, and 
visual impairments. In eighteen museums, wheelchairs were provided 
upon request for individuals with physical, hearing, and visual impair-
ments. Three museums had staff proficient in sign language, and twenty-
four museums used large-font informational texts for artifact descriptions. 
It was noted that only one museum had brochures in Braille alphabet, and 
that in fifteen museums, in-service training was provided to museum staff 
for communication with individuals with special needs.

Upon examining Table 4, it is observed that in twenty-two museums 
evaluated in the study, contrast colors were used on glass surfaces. Four-
teen museums had elevators suitable for individuals with physical, hea-
ring, and visual impairments. Sixteen museums had ramps in areas with 
level differences. Five museums allowed visits accompanied by guide 
dogs for visually impaired individuals. The corridors in twenty-five mu-
seums were wide enough for wheelchair use, and five museums had rai-
sed relief maps of the museum structure.

As seen in Table 5, it is observed that in the fifteen museums evaluated 
in the study, there were designated parking spaces for disabled individu-
als. Twenty-seven museums had toilets suitable for use by disabled indi-
viduals. Eighteen museums had seating areas available for use by disabled 
individuals during museum visits. Portable listening devices were provi-
ded in eleven museums. However, it was noted that there were no direc-
tional signs arranged in Braille alphabet in any of the museums. 
 
Conclusion, Discussion and Recommendations 
 
Museums, as institutions that form the collective memory of society, brid-
ging the past with the present and transmitting it to the future, should be 
organized within the framework of the principle of equality, regardless of 
whether individuals have disabilities or not (Yeşilyurt et al., 2014). Ensu-
ring accessibility and inclusivity in museums is not only a requirement of 
being a social state but also, above all, a necessity for all individuals who 
constitute society to benefit from the opportunities provided by the state 
under equal conditions (Tozlu et al., 2012). The accessibility of museums, 
along with considering the needs of individuals with disabilities in mu-
seum arrangements, is also important for the integration of disabled 

Murat Balcı  
 
1506     
       
 
individuals into the society they live in (Diker & Çetinkaya, 2016). Mu-
seums should serve as inclusive spaces, providing rich and varied life 
experiences to individuals regardless of their background or abilities, and 
offer opportunities for everyone to engage in activities freely, without en-
countering barriers, while celebrating and embracing diversity (Danacı 
Polat, 2019). Museums belong to "everyone". Therefore, it is important to 
transform museums into places where "everyone" can benefit (Aktop, 
2022). 
In this study, a total of 41 state and private museums in Istanbul Pro-
vince, affiliated with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and other insti-
tutions, were examined for their suitability and accessibility for individu-
als with physical, visual, and hearing impairments, using checklists con-
sisting of 23 questions. 
The research conducted examined 41 museums, and it was found that 
none of them fully met or complied with the criteria for tactile surface co-
vering, replicas of exhibited artworks, touch replicas, audio descriptions, 
audio guides, sign language guides, display cases, and Braille alphabet 
usage. The implementation of these criteria was deemed inadequate. 
Upon reviewing the results of the museum-related research, it was obser-
ved that only one museum had tactile surface coverings and replicas of 
exhibited artworks, that audio descriptions were available in 12 museums, 
and that display cases where artworks were exhibited did not have sharp 
corners in 19 museums. Another finding of the research was the absence 
of Braille alphabet explanations in any of the museums. Considering fac-
tors such as the low percentage of individuals who are proficient in Braille 
(2.5% nationwide), high costs, and the unavailability of printing services 
in this regard, it would be a more appropriate approach to develop solu-
tions that are sustainable and accessible to all visually impaired individu-
als (Başkurt, 2015). 
Another finding of the research is that in none of the museums evalu-
ated, audio guide services and audio description tours were available. The 
high costs associated with technology-based applications used in audio 
description tours, as well as the periodic maintenance and updates requi-
red, pose significant challenges in procuring this service within the bud-
gets allocated to museums (Özarslan, 2019). 
When the exhibition areas and display surfaces of the museums exami-
ned in the study were analyzed, it was found that only 18 museums took 
preventive measures to avoid injuries for individuals with physical,

     1507 
 
hearing, and visual impairments, while no such measures were taken in 
22 museums. The display areas where the artworks are exhibited are cus-
tom-made products, and opting for rounded products instead of sharp-
edged ones at the ordering stage would not only incur additional costs for 
institutions but also transform exhibition spaces into safer and more ac-
cessible places for individuals with physical, visual, and hearing impair-
ments. 
The research conducted examined 41 museums, and it was found that 
none of them fully met or complied with the criteria for collecting statisti-
cal information on disabled individuals, providing wheelchair access, 
using large-font for informational texts about artworks, providing in-ser-
vice training to museum staff for communication with disabled individu-
als, and employing personnel proficient in sign language. The implemen-
tation of these criteria was deemed inadequate. Furthermore, none of the 
museums examined in the study maintained statistical data specifically 
related to disabled visitors. Regularly collecting statistical data is crucial 
not only for providing information about disabled visitors to museums 
but also for determining the necessary investments in making appropriate 
accommodations for them. Regular statistics will not only provide infor-
mation on which types of disabilities are predominantly represented 
among visitors but also serve as a roadmap for determining the necessary 
accommodations for disabled individuals in visited museums. 
In the scope of the study, it was found that only 3 out of the 41 mu-
seums examined employed staff proficient in sign language. However, 
this issue stems more from the perspective towards disabled individuals 
visiting museums rather than being purely economic. By reaching out to 
adult education centers or universities providing sign language training, 
in-service training sessions for museum staff could be organized without 
the need for additional personnel recruitment, enabling current staff to le-
arn sign language. Indeed, within the scope of the "Accessible Museums 
Project" conducted in Bursa between 2015 and 2016, sign language trai-
ning was provided to 25 museum personnel over an 8-month period. This 
addressed the shortage of staff proficient in sign language without 
requiring additional hiring, thereby ensuring that hearing-impaired indi-
viduals receive sign language support during museum visits (Erbay, 
2017). 
Within the scope of the study, it was determined that only 15 out of the 
41 museums examined provided in-service training to museum staff on 

Murat Balcı  
 
1508     
       
 
communicating with disabled individuals. Especially in today's world, 
where communication is "everything," communication with disabled in-
dividuals is one of the issues that requires careful attention. In-service tra-
ining on communicating with disabled individuals will not only enhance 
empathy skills among museum staff but also minimize potential commu-
nication problems with disabled individuals to the fullest extent possible 
(Göktaş & Bulgan, 2016). Furthermore, such training will not impose ad-
ditional budget pressure on museums with limited budgets but will ins-
tead enhance the quality and quantity of their own resources. 
The research findings revealed that none of the 41 museums examined 
fully complied with the criteria for contrast colors on display surfaces, di-
sabled elevators, ramps, guide dogs, tactile maps, and corridor width su-
itable for wheelchairs, indicating insufficient implementation of these cri-
teria. Among the 41 museums surveyed, only 3 accepted guide dogs, 
while 38 museums did not allow guide dogs during museum visits. 
However, any such practice or sanction that treats a disabled individual 
unfavorably due to their disability is referred to as "discrimination arising 
from disability". For example, if a visually impaired individual using a 
guide dog wishes to visit a museum with their guide dog, and museum 
officials claim that the guide dog could pose a safety risk to others or 
artworks, resulting in the guide dog being denied entry, it constitutes disc-
rimination arising from disability and carries legal consequences (Elmacı, 
2019). 
The research found that out of the examined museums, only 19 had 
elevators, while 22 did not. Moreover, it was observed that many of the 
museums with elevators did not meet the necessary standards for disab-
led access. The absence of elevators in multi-story buildings is often attri-
buted to their historical nature, with concerns about preserving the histo-
rical fabric of these structures. However, it should be noted that there are 
elevator systems designed to provide access to historical buildings from 
the exterior without causing damage to their historical integrity. For 
example, Çimenlik Castle, located within the boundaries of Çanakkale 
province and built in 1463, serves as an example from Turkey. As a multi-
story structure, Çimenlik Castle features an external elevator system 
constructed to allow disabled individuals to access other floors without 
compromising the castle's historical fabric (Nemutlu, 2021). 
Out of the museums examined in the study, only 16 had ramps in areas 
with level differences, while the remaining 25 museums lacked ramps in 

Museums! How Accessible for Individuals with Disabilities? 
 
     1509 
 
such areas. This situation particularly poses accessibility issues for disab-
led individuals, significantly restricting their freedom of movement wit-
hin the museum premises. Permanent ramps can be installed in museums, 
and in historical buildings converted into museums, and portable ramp 
applications can be implemented to ensure the mobility of disabled indi-
viduals without compromising the historical integrity of structures (Baş et 
al., 2015). 
The research examined 41 museums, none of which fully met the crite-
ria for disabled parking, accessible toilets, directional signs for disabled 
individuals, seating areas, and portable listening devices. It was conclu-
ded that there was insufficient implementation of these criteria. None of 
the museums examined in the study had directional signs that complied 
with the standards for disabled individuals. Braille alphabet directional 
signs provide information to disabled individuals about their current lo-
cation and the locations they would like to reach, thus enhancing their 
mobility (Yapıcı, 2022). In Batman province, the "Accessible Museums 
Project" conducted between 2015 and 2016 included an 8-month process 
that implemented embossed images and alphabets in historical sites. This 
initiative facilitated the transfer of information about the structures and 
their contents, particularly benefiting visually impaired individuals, thus 
enhancing accessibility to these historical sites (Erbay, 2017). 
The research revealed that out of the 41 museums examined, only 11 
had portable listening devices, while the remaining 30 lacked such provi-
sion. Particularly in museums where there are no tactile copies or replicas 
of artworks for visually impaired individuals, the widespread implemen-
tation of portable listening device applications is crucial for them to acqu-
ire information about museums and the exhibited artworks. One of the 
best examples of such practices is undoubtedly the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art in New York. In this museum, provisions are made to accommodate 
both visitors with visual and hearing impairments through the provision 
of portable listening devices. Additionally, the museum offers sign langu-
age interpretation services, encompassing group tours as well as audio 
descriptive tours (Küllük, 2019). 
The research identified significant deficiencies in accessibility for indi-
viduals with physical, visual, and hearing impairments in the museums 
examined. It is thought that making adjustments for accessibility and inc-
lusivity in museums for individuals with physical, visual, and hearing im-
pairments will positively impact their motivation to visit museums and 

Murat Balcı  
 
1510     
       
 
increase demand for museum visits. Moreover, such museum adjustments 
are expected to reduce the need for caregiver support for disabled indivi-
duals, thereby enhancing their freedom of movement, self-confidence, 
and sense of belonging to society. Implementing accessibility measures for 
disabled individuals in museums will facilitate more museum visits by 
disabled individuals, thus easing their social integration and fostering a 
culture of living together with diversity in society. 
The increase in the number of educated and employed individuals 
with disabilities, as well as the enactment of laws aimed at protecting the 
rights of disabled individuals, are positive developments that have enab-
led them to participate more actively and effectively in various aspects of 
social life. This has not only made disabled individuals and their issues 
more visible but has also fostered the formation of a social awareness 
towards resolving these issues. Findings from a literature review reveal 
that numerous adjustments have been made in museums worldwide, par-
ticularly in Europe, to enhance accessibility for individuals with physical, 
visual, and hearing impairments. As a result, disabled individuals are able 
to integrate into social life more effectively. Based on the findings, recom-
mendations for improving accessibility for individuals with physical, vi-
sual, and hearing impairments in museums in Turkey can be summarized 
as follows: Implementing tactile surface coverings for visually impaired 
individuals both inside and outside the museum, using contrasting colors 
on surfaces and employing non-slip surface materials; using contrast co-
lors on display cases and creating tactile replicas of exhibited artworks; 
providing audio descriptions for exhibited artworks, utilizing Braille alp-
habet on informational texts, opting for larger font sizes and bold colors 
on informational texts; installing portable listening devices providing in-
formation about exhibited artworks and organizing audio description to-
urs accompanied by audio guides; providing subtitles on visual informa-
tional materials such as videos for individuals with hearing impairments; 
employing staff proficient in sign language; providing training to mu-
seum personnel on effective communication with disabled individuals; 
ensuring that disabled parking, toilets, and elevators are designed in 
compliance with accessibility standards; and installing ramps in areas 
with differences in elevation and allowing visits with guide dogs. These 
measures aim to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of museums for 
individuals with disabilities in Turkey.

In order for individuals with physical, visual, and hearing impairments 
to equally benefit from all the opportunities provided by the state as a so-
cial welfare obligation, more should be conducted beyond the "free admis-
sion" policy for disabled individuals. While the efforts and projects of pri-
vate institutions and NGOs should be supported, long-term and state-bac-
ked initiatives aimed at providing lasting solutions should be developed 
and implemented to address the challenges and inequalities in this field. 
By doing so, barriers to accessibility between museums and individuals 
will be removed, taking a significant step towards achieving social equa-
lity.
