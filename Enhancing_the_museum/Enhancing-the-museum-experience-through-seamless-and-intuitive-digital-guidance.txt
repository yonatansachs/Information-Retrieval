ABSTRACT 
 
In the last decades, technology has created a culture of instant gratification to the point 
where people expect to be able to access information and entertainment at a moment's 
notice. The desire for rapid content consumption is reflected in individuals opting for more 
captivating and fast-paced activities. In response to this shift, museums and other cultural 
institutions have had to adapt to engage and educate their visitors. Adopting digital guides 
and interactive technologies allows them to cater to the needs of modern audiences and 
their expectations of fast and easy access to information. This comes with the risks of 
excluding visitors with disabilities or limited exposure to such technology. Therefore, it is 
crucial to thoroughly study the design of digital museum applications. 
This thesis aims to investigate the design of a digital museum guide app that effectively 
reduces distractions and minimizes non-informative screen time, enabling visitors to fully 
engage with and appreciate the museum's exhibits. By simplifying the app and 
incorporating user-friendly gestures, this study seeks to provide a seamless and inclusive 
digital guidance experience for visitors with different accessibility barriers.

ΠΕΡΙΛΗΨΗ 
 
Τις τελευταίες δεκαετίες, η τεχνολογία έχει δημιουργήσει μια κουλτούρα άμεσης 
ικανοποίησης σε βαθμό που η πρόσβαση σε πληροφορίες και ψυχαγωγία αναμένεται να 
είναι στιγμιαία. Η επιθυμία για γρήγορη κατανάλωση περιεχομένου αποτυπώνεται στο 
γεγονός ότι ο κόσμος επιλέγει πιο εντυπωσιακές και ταχύρρυθμες δραστηριότητες. Για το 
λόγο αυτό, τα μουσεία και λοιπά πολιτιστικά ιδρύματα χρειάστηκε να προσαρμοστούν 
ώστε να εκπαιδεύσουν και να κινήσουν το ενδιαφέρον των επισκεπτών τους. Η απόκτηση 
ψηφιακών οδηγών και διαδραστικών τεχνολογιών, τους επιτρέπει να ικανοποιούν τις 
ανάγκες του σύγχρονου κοινού τους και τις προσδοκίες τους για άμεση και εύκολη 
πρόσβαση στη πληροφορία. Αυτό συνεπάγεται το ρίσκο να αποκλειστούν επισκέπτες με 
αναπηρίες ή με περιορισμένη έκθεση σε αντίστοιχες τεχνολογίες.  
Σκοπός της παρούσας είναι να εξεταστεί ο σχεδιασμός μιας ψηφιακής εφαρμογής 
μουσειακού οδηγού που μειώνει τις αποσπάσεις και τον χρόνο που απαιτείται η χρήση 
της οθόνης για μη ενημερωτικούς λόγους. Με τον τρόπο αυτό, επιτρέπει στους 
επισκέπτες να αλληλεπιδράσουν και να εκτιμήσουν τα εκθέματα του μουσείου στο 
έπακρο. Απλοποιώντας την εφαρμογή και ενσωματώνοντας κινήσεις εύκολες στη χρήση, 
η παρούσα πτυχιακή επιδιώκει να προσφέρει μια απρόσκοπτη ψηφιακή μουσειακή 
εμπειρία για όλους, ανεξάρτητα από αναπηρίες ή ψηφιακού γραμματισμού.

PREFACE 
This project took place in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the 
National and Kapodistrian University of Athens as a bachelor thesis under the supervision 
of Dr Maria Roussou. Its duration from its start until its completion was one semester.

INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Subject and Motives  
The quest to incorporate digital technologies in cultural institutions has sparked the 
emergence of immersive exhibitions and increased creativity in presenting information to 
foster memorable experiences and meaningful connections with the topics at hand. 
Meanwhile, technology can potentially detract from those experiences if it becomes 
obtrusive or challenging. This is often the case when interacting with the technology 
requires taking the visitor’s attention from the actual heritage content to perform 
operational tasks. Especially for visitors with disabilities or limited familiarity with 
technology, innovative approaches may break immersion, disrupting the flow of thoughts 
and emotions that the exhibits are meant to evoke.  
As Kidd and Nieto McAvoy noted, “deep immersion in an experience is best achieved 
when the technology becomes invisible – that is, it fades into the background rather than 
itself being the experience as noted above” [1]. To best incorporate digital solutions in 
cultural settings, they must be user-friendly, easy to navigate, and provide clear 
instructions to encourage visitors to interact with the technology. Especially for visitors 
with disabilities or limited familiarity with technology, such approaches may serve as a 
distraction, disrupting the flow of thoughts and emotions that the exhibits are meant to 
evoke.  
The present thesis seeks to address this challenge and explore the design of a more 
inclusive and frictionless digital audio guide using a simplified interface and Near Field 
Communication technology [2] to trigger app workflows. The goal is to reduce cognitive 
load, improve accessibility, and enhance the overall museum experience for all visitors. 
We use the Museum of Informatics and Telecommunications of the National and 
Kapodistrian University of Athens as a case study to attempt to contribute to the broader 
field of museum studies and encourage a shift towards more inclusive and transparent 
museum experiences. 
 
1.2. Context of Use 
The Museum of Informatics and Telecommunications, or MI&T, founded in 2019, is one 
of the museums of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, NKUA. It is 
currently not open to the public as it is undergoing construction. The MI&T hosts the 
archive and collections of the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, DIT. 
One of its key objectives is to promote awareness and interest in the field among the 
general population. 
Specifically, the museum will offer a comprehensive history of Informatics and 
Telecommunications from the 1940s to the present day in Greece and the rest of the 
world. It will highlight the research and educational activities of the department, 
illuminating the history of Informatics as a science and its effects on our daily lives. The 
museum aims to expose the concept of computational thinking and its applications to the 
public. Its target audience includes the DIT community of students and researchers, 
prospective students, specialized visitors, and the general public. 
The MI&T is located on the ground floor of the Department of Informatics and 
Telecommunications, below its Reading Room, where the first University-wide Data 
Centre was initially housed.  The museum will consist of 4 main halls, as depicted in 
Figure 1: the Entrance, the Introduction room, the Main hall, and the public part of the 
museum's Archive.

In the Introduction room, the visitors will explore an interactive timeline of the history of 
Informatics and Telecommunications, wall prints and showcases with objects from the 
department’s collection and a special exhibit of the logarithmic rule as a precursor of 
computers. The Main hall will host six core sections: the Mathematical Computer (the 
40s-50s), the Business Computer (the 50s-60s and into the 70s), the Personal/Home 
Computer (the 80s), the Networked Computer (the 90s), the Creative Computer (the 00s), 
and the Ubiquitous Computer (the 10s+).  
The MI&T seeks to put the visitor at the center of the museum experience. It aims to make 
the visitor actively participate in the exhibition by interacting with some of the exhibits. 
There will be digital tables, flexible digital interactive surfaces, audio stories, and social 
interaction among visitors will be encouraged. The architectural design of the MI&T 
consists of suspended ceilings and color-coded open areas that let the visitor walk around 
freely, explore, and examine any of the six time periods sub-areas.

The 
museological 
study 
conducted 
for 
the 
Museum 
of 
Informatics 
and 
Telecommunications has addressed a plethora of design decisions to accommodate 
visitors with disabilities, including the installation of a ramp at the museum's entrance, 
restrooms for disabled visitors, free-standing exhibits and display cases at an appropriate 
height, open space areas with wide corridors for wheelchair movement, rest areas or 
benches, and signs with suitable typeface, color, size, and height for easy reading [3]. 
With its multitude of interactive activities and multimedia exhibits, and its commitment to 
creating an inclusive environment, the Museum of Informatics and Telecommunications 
is designed to provide an immersive experience for all. This thesis aims to explore the 
design of a seamless audio guide in such an environment, highlighting its benefits in 
providing more accessible access to information and facilitating a deeper engagement 
with MI&T’s artifacts. 
 
1.3. Structure 
This thesis consists of 4 chapters, which can be summarized as such: 
1. Introduction: The previous sections outline the focus of this work and present an 
overview of the Museum of Informatics and Telecommunications, which will act as 
the use case for this thesis.

users’ needs and ways to improve. It also mentions concepts and research 
projects that inspired this work, such as ambient intelligence and universal design.  
3. Design: Chapter 3 consists of the idea around the design of the mobile application,  
and the user-centered design process. It provides an in-depth look at the user 
personas developed, user scenarios and several requirements and specifications 
to cater to their needs. High-fidelity prototypes are also included, along with 
descriptions of their usage.  
4. Conclusions and Future Work: Chapter 4 discusses the results of the design 
process and possible areas for future work, including the integration of the audio 
guide with more advanced features, the development of a user testing and 
evaluation plan and the implementation of the app.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
2.1. Museum Guides 
In this section, we will examine case studies and concepts of existing museum guides 
and their impact on the research focus of this thesis; we will analyze their design and 
features and identify aspects relevant to this thesis. 
To attract visitors in the competitive landscape of entertainment options, cultural hubs 
must provide captivating experiences. Mobile technologies have played a significant role 
in attracting new audiences to museums accommodating visitors with varying 
preferences and needs. Roussou and Katifori [4] investigated the user experience of 
mobile museum narratives. They found that while diverse content can enhance the 
experience, it poses challenges, such as balancing visitors’ attention between the screen 
and the physical space, ensuring proper navigation, balancing story and interpretive 
content, and catering to diverse user profiles. 
Among the many mobile-based solutions, the Bring Your Own Device, or BYOD, 
approach allows visitors to use their own smartphones or tablets during their museum 
visits. This model has become increasingly popular in museums of all sizes due to its 
cost-effectiveness and the fact that visitors are already using their devices for recreational 
purposes during their visit, such as taking pictures of the exhibits or seeking additional 
information [4]. However, there are also challenges to consider when implementing the 
Bring Your Own Device solution, namely the need for a stable and reliable network 
connection and ensuring that the content is accessible to visitors with different devices 
and operating systems and mitigating distraction from the exhibit content [5].  
An example of a project that has gradually adopted the Bring Your Own Device model is 
the “British Museum Audio” [6] guide for the British Museum in London. It consists of a 
museum map and additional multimedia content for the museum’s galleries and 
exhibitions. Until 2022, the guide could not be downloaded on the visitors’ devices and 
had the form of a mobile-like lightweight device owned by the museum. Nowadays, it 
comes in the form of a mobile application that offers a more personalized experience by 
allowing visitors to save their favorite tours or download content to their devices. 
In 2014, five years after its initial launch, a need for a user-centered redesign was noticed. 
A research paper presented at the “Museums and the Web” conference in 2015 [7] 
revealed the findings of a qualitative study performed at the British Museum regarding 
visitors’ behavior and preferences towards audio guides.  
The research revealed that 75% of the guide’s users heavily depended on it as their 
primary means of navigating and obtaining information. Around 15% to 20% of the users 
made “sporadic and often disinterested use of the audio guide” and often appeared to 
quit after a few stops. This behavioral pattern valued the freedom to explore the museum 
at their own pace, and only approach exhibits that sparked their interest. Another 
interesting observation was that this group was very involved with their devices, phones, 
tablets, or cameras.

Nomination, Audio guide at the British Museum 
Currently, the guide is compatible with mobile devices and consists of a gallery- and tour-
based mode. The tour-based mode consists of self-guided tours with a list of stops and 
an estimated duration. Visitors choose a tour and follow the guide's instructions via audio 
and text. Alternatively, in the gallery-based mode, visitors can selectively explore the 
exhibits and browse at their own pace listening to the stops in any order they desire.  
To use the guide, visitors can enter the number next to the exhibit into the app’s keypad. 
Each stop lasts approximately 2 to 3 minutes, showcasing the artifact’s high-quality 
images and additional resources such as related exhibits and other reading materials.

screen, 2023. The British Museum Audio app 
Regarding accessibility, the app states that its visitors should be able to “navigate easily 
between sections, select a tour, listen to a tour, change the text size, use the app with a 
screen reader”, meeting the Web Content and Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 standard.

Additionally, as showcased in Figure 4, the audio content is accompanied by a “Read in 
text” option, benefiting individuals with hearing impairments. 
Despite being an accessible and usable application grounded in user research and a 
valuable case study for this thesis, the “British Museum Audio” still presents certain 
limitations. Its reliance on entering a key or browsing the app’s collection to access 
information may disrupt the visitors’ immersion by moving their interest from the exhibits 
to the screen.  
Another potential issue of the “British Museum Audio” guide is the absence of social 
engagement, attributed to its lack of features that inspire visitors to share their experience 
with their social circle. To incorporate the social aspects of a museum experience in this 
study, we examined a project that focuses on providing museums with such features, “the 
GIFT Box” [8].  
“The GIFT Box” is an EU-funded research project that has developed a smartphone app 
for museums to encourage visitors to share their narratives and emotions based on the 
exhibits they encounter during their visit. The program has collaborated with multiple 
museums that worked as case studies and aided the research process. The “GIFT App” 
is a simple interface allowing visitors to share their own multimedia creations inspired by 
the museum’s artifacts.  
Each visitor may give or receive up to three “gifts”, each consisting of a picture of the 
selected object, a voice message of their thoughts and a text hint with instructions to find 
the exhibit. The gift can be as long or short as the giver intends to and can be sent to 
people within the museum or elsewhere.  
 
Figure 5: Recording screen of the GIFT mobile application. Gift project, Blast Theory 
One of the pilot cases of the gifting experience at the Brighton Museum & Art Gallery 
resulted in several noteworthy findings [9]. Visitors in the study reported that they viewed 
the museum from a fresh perspective, “imagining what their receiver would like, or what 
their giver had thought they would like” [10], which also led to them feeling connected to

the objects they sent or received. The application’s instructions were given in both text 
and audio, delivered in a casual tone, and vocabulary influencing the gifting process and 
overall museum experience. The research revealed that directing the experience toward 
audio was a successful method to keep the visitors from shifting their attention to their 
devices.

received through the GIFT application. MW19 Boston, The GIFT Framework: Give Visitors the 
Tools to Tell Their Own Stories 
The “GIFT App” serves as a means for sharing user-generated content and achieving 
social impact while facilitating a multifaceted appreciation and more thorough exploration 
of the exhibits, aspects that we seek to incorporate in our research. 
Fostering a frictionless guiding experience within the scope of accessibility is another key 
objective of this thesis. Notably, “Out Loud” [11], an inclusive audio guide for the Andy 
Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, uses Bluetooth to show visitors stories based on their 
location. It focuses on accessibility and specifically aims to design an optimized 
experience for visually impaired visitors.  
In terms of design, the user research showed that visitors preferred a sense of 
independence within the museum and the freedom to make their own choices [12]. In 
response, each artwork is accompanied by short audio clips of categorized content, such 
as an introduction, historical context, and visual description, rather than a single longer 
clip with all the information. Visitors also expressed their desire to limit physical 
interactions as they often use service dogs, canes, or guides to navigate within the 
museum.   
“Out Loud” is compatible with iOS and supports VoiceOver, the system’s built-in feature 
to describe on-screen elements and Dynamic Type for text size customization. While 
implementing the application, researchers concluded that announcing state changes, 
such as audio autoplay, cross-checking text-to-speech conversions and maintaining a

23 
consistent semantic structure are crucial to ensure successful screen-reading 
compatibility. They also took advantage of “Magic Tap”, a two-finger double tap which 
can be assigned to an app-specific action as they discovered that VoiceOver users were 
instinctively using it to perform intuitive actions such as pausing the audio.  
To fully accommodate users with visual impairments, the interface adjusts to the use of 
VoiceOver. When VoiceOver is enabled, a visual description audio file is prioritized and 
moved at the top of the audio clips list, following a brief introduction. Upon user testing, a 
pattern was noticed indicating that all of the participants who relied on the VoiceOver 
functionality to navigate through the app preferred to choose when to play the next audio 
chapter, while testers who did not use VoiceOver favored autoplay. To cater to both 
preferences, the default setting is to autoplay, but this functionality is disabled when 
VoiceOver is activated. 
 
Figure 7: Out Loud’s application screenshots of audio media player. MW17 Cleveland, A Path With 
Choice: What We Learned From Designing An Inclusive Audio Guide 
The application consists of two modes (Figure 7), the “Stories” view, which displays all 
available audio descriptions and the “Near me” view, which filters the audio based on 
location. To achieve the latter, it used Bluetooth low-energy beacons. The initial strategy 
was to place one beacon per exhibit and deliver the audio of the one with the strongest 
signal. This implementation proved unsuccessful and caused the guide to autoplay 
incorrect audio, switching between objects. Consequently, an adaptation was made, and 
beacons were placed to cover an entire room, filtering the audio per room instead. 
Sharing the same goal for a seamless museum experience, Pedersen et al. conducted a 
research [13] on designing a soundwalk with “no interface” in the process of creating 
Bezæt, an audio walk for the history of the squatter movement in Copenhagen. The idea 
entailed of users listening to audio stories narrated by members of the movement as they 
would walk through their neighborhoods.

Their initial design using map-based navigation relieved a set of drawbacks during the 
testing phase. The GPS positioning was not accurate enough to guide the users 
successfully and often caused user frustration, while the map interface proved to be a 
source of distraction. Given that the purpose of the experience is to immerse users in the 
urban environment, Bezæt’s design was revisited to deter users from looking at the 
screen of their devices and instead direct their attention to their surroundings. The map-
based prototype was replaced with a minimal GUI containing solely the necessary audio 
controls and a single map screen showing the starting point of the walk. This translated 
to an increased need for highly descriptive audio navigation instructions and orientation 
hints. The design evaluation showed that the lack of GPS and a map interface did not 
hinder the participants’ ability to navigate the soundwalk route. Many reported feeling 
more in control of the experience and enjoyed the simple design.  
"Talking Statues” [14] aimed to achieve a non-disrupting interface for an outdoor cultural 
experience as well. In 2014, Sing London, alongside several partners, created a website 
that would host “conversations” of users with statues found around London [15]. Given 
that the experience primarily catered to pedestrians passing by the statues, it was 
deemed necessary to eliminate the need for users to download an application in advance. 
A website was created for this purpose, and the user journey was designed as follows.  
After locating a statue, the user taps their phone on the statue’s tag, scans the QR code 
or manually types a URL address to trigger the launch of the website, which imitates a 
Phone Call screen. The user accepts the “call” from the statue, and a pre-recorded audio 
file is played. Following the call, the user is redirected to the statue’s page to access 
further information, view a map of other available statues, and share their experience with 
others.

The project examined how Near Field Communication could attract non-traditional 
audiences, such as the youth or people with disabilities, and encourage them to 
participate in participating cultural activities. Observations and interviews with users of 
Talking Statue showed that people of different ages and museum-going frequencies were 
using the NFC technology. Even though iOS mobile phones, the most commonly used 
type among participants, did not support NFC at the time of the study, users still opted 
for alternative methods. However, 40% of users were able to use NFC to access Talking

Statues, potentially due to the assistance of research staff who helped older or less 
technologically confident users and lent devices to those without NFC-compatible 
phones. Some of them stated that the facilitators’ help was crucial to their ability to access 
the content. Although instructions were sometimes misunderstood, such as users trying 
to tap the sign with their fingers or feet instead of their phone, 80% of users agreed that 
“using NFC/QR tags made the experience more enjoyable”. 
Almost a decade later, NFC usage has increased, and more smartphone users are 
familiar with the technology [16]. However, their user research showed that more explicit 
instructions are needed to make the interaction more inviting to older or unfamiliar users. 
While Talking Statue is intended for an outdoor setting where the statues are scattered 
throughout the city, its call-and-answer interaction could become tedious and repetitive 
in a museum context where exhibits are more closely situated. Nevertheless, the overall 
design of the application closely aligns with the scope of this thesis. It serves as a 
significant source of inspiration alongside certain aspects of the previously mentioned 
projects. 
 
2.2. Ubiquitous Computing 
According to Mark Weiser, 1991, ubiquitous computing, also called ubicomp, “enhances 
computer use by making many computers available throughout the physical environment 
but making them effectively invisible to the user” [17]. 
Ubiquitous computing is a concept whose primary objective is to make human interaction 
with technology more natural, similar to the way humans interact with the physical world. 
This can be achieved by using natural forms of communication, such as speech, touch, 
gestures, and haptics, called Natural User Interfaces [18], to supplement or replace 
traditional GUI interfaces. These natural interfaces carry minimal cognitive overhead and 
should, by definition, be easier to use for children, inexperienced users, and those with 
disabilities, who would find traditional interfaces less accessible. 
In the context of cultural settings specifically, their main challenge is “to design a 
multimedia presentation in such a way that it will convey the information to the visitors, 
thus enriching the visit experience, without distracting their attention from the exhibits 
themselves” [19]. User experience evaluations ( [4], [19], [20], [21], [22]) and related work 
mentioned in 2.1. have proven that digital museum guides can hinder visitors from 
focusing on their surroundings, often absorbed by the screen, or preoccupied with 
navigating the interface.  
Although the MI&T digital audio guide we have designed does not fully align with the 
principles of ubicomp, it inspired the subject of this thesis and led to the idea of using 
Near Field Communication to provide a more seamless experience. At this point, BYOD 
is a widespread model that allows us to approach unobtrusive guidance, though 
eventually, our goal would be to utilize the full potential of ubiquitous computing. 
 
2.2.1. Near Field Communication 
Near Field Communication, also known as NFC, is a form of ubiquitous interaction which 
allows for short-range wireless communication between two compatible devices. It was 
developed by Philips and Sony in 2002 and is based on radio-frequency identification, 
RFID, a technology that enables two devices to communicate with each other by sending 
and receiving radio signals. NFC uses a base frequency of 13.56 MHz to transfer data up 
to 424 Kbit/s at a distance of 4 cm [2]. The communication requires an initiator device, 
which triggers and controls the data transfer and a target device that replies to the 

Enhancing the museum experience through seamless and straightforward digital guidance 
R. Chiou 
26 
former’s request [23]. Although NFC technology currently operates in multiple modes, 
some of which are the [24]: 
1. Reader/Writer mode, where a contactless reader, such as an NFC reading device 
or mobile phone, can access or modify information stored in a contactless tag. This 
is a case of passive NFC technology as only one device generates the radio 
frequency and energy required to communicate with an inactive object. 
2. Peer-to-Peer mode, where two NFC devices are brought together to exchange 
data. In this active NFC communication, the peers recognize each other and 
generate their own radiofrequency field and broadcast data within that field.  
3. Card emulation mode, where an NFC device operates as a contactless card, often 
used for contactless payments or ticketing in public transport. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, NFC became exponentially popular in a plethora of 
fields as it was an efficient solution to adopt within a short time window to ensure the 
safety of the population. A survey by ABI Research was conducted in 2022 to determine 
the behavior and understanding of consumers regarding Near Field Communication [16], 
while considering the pandemic’s impact on their familiarity with it. The study collected 
answers from 2620 participants worldwide, aged 18 and over, who had used contactless 
technology at least once.  
Their findings showed that 95% of them were at least somewhat familiar with NFC 
contactless technology and it was stated that a steady increase in NFC usage is expected 
in the near future. Given that such a large fraction of the population is equipped with a 
basic intuition to interact with an NFC tag successfully, it became our tool of choice to 
create a ubiquitous system within cultural institutions. 
 
2.3. User Interfaces for All 
In the context of designing mobile interfaces for all users, it is important to consider the 
principles and methods of inclusive design. As noted by Stephanidis [25], the primary 
objective of inclusive design is to create products and services that can be used by the 
widest possible range of individuals, regardless of their abilities.  
The design of mobile interfaces is centered around finger-based gestures that rely on a 
multi-touch interface. While this may be intuitive for experienced users, for individuals 
who lack digital literacy or have disabilities, such gestures can pose significant challenges 
and create barriers to accessing the full range of features and functionalities offered by 
mobile devices. These users may struggle to hold the device in the correct position, view 
the screen, and perform delicate touch actions, rendering many mobile apps and features 
inaccessible [26].  
To achieve inclusivity and accessibility, it is important to seek alternative methods and 
technologies that enable all users to interact with the application successfully and 
effortlessly, 
regardless 
of 
their 
physical 
abilities 
or 
digital 
literacy 
levels. 
Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that visitors with disabilities can equally benefit from 
every feature of the mobile application, just like visitors who do not have disabilities and 
are fluent in mobile device use.

DESIGN 
3.1. The Idea  
The increasing cognitive load we have been trained to handle by the constant use of 
technology in our daily lives has created the expectation for museums and cultural hubs 
to provide their visitors with access to digital resources that enhance their visit. Despite 
the trend towards digital museum guides, many of these guides fail to provide a seamless 
and inclusive experience for visitors with disabilities or limited digital experience.  
This thesis examines the creation of a digital guide for the Museum of Informatics and 
Telecommunications of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. It aims to offer 
visitors a simplified and intuitive interface that delivers digital guidance without sacrificing 
their immersion in the exhibits. 
To ensure visitors with different accessibility barriers can have access to an equally 
rewarding visitor experience in terms of content and usability, the application incorporates 
gesture-based and contactless technologies, such as Near-Field Communication. The 
interface is designed to be intuitive and mitigate potential distractions, allowing visitors to 
fully immerse themselves in the museum exhibits while ensuring that information is 
always accessible. This way the app will serve as a discreet assistant that will enhance 
the overall museum experience without sacrificing visitor engagement or disrupting their 
immersion in the museum's content. 
Finally, a "souvenir" feature of the MI&T museum guide app enables the extension of its 
social impact to the digital realm through a camera page and a recording page. The 
concept involves each exhibit having its own simple Augmented Reality camera screen 
that will show basic information about it in the form of an overlay, allowing the visitors to 
capture photos or videos tagged with the name of the exhibit. Alternatively, a recording 
page may be selected instead to create a sound-based reminder of the exhibit and their 
interaction with it. These features provide a unique, self-captured digital keepsake that 
can be saved to the visitor’s device, allow them to share their experience with others and 
create a lasting token of their time at the museum. 
 
3.2. User Groups 
The Museum of Informatics & Telecommunications digital guide is committed to providing 
an enjoyable experience for all its visitors, including those who may face technological 
challenges or have disabilities. The application caters to the diverse needs of its visitors 
by offering a straightforward and intuitive interface.  
To achieve this, in this thesis we have chosen to focus on two main user groups who 
have distinct preferences and requirements for museum guidance: who may have 
physical disabilities and those who experience low vision. We believe that by designing 
with these groups in mind, we can create an application that is more usable and 
accommodating for “All” [25]. 
Visitors with fine motor difficulties consist of the first user group of the application. For the 
sake of clarity, this group will henceforth be referred to as ‘Visitors with limited dexterity' 
throughout this thesis. Within this group lie people who may have physical disabilities that 
make it challenging for them to use traditional touchscreen devices or to fully view and 
touch exhibits. They aim to access supplementary content related to the exhibits without 
feeling restricted or challenged by potential physical limitations. 
The second user group, ‘Visitors with low vision’, often face challenges in traditional 
museums due to visual impairments. These individuals may struggle to view exhibits, 

Enhancing the museum experience through seamless and straightforward digital guidance 
R. Chiou 
28 
read information, or follow written instructions, making it difficult for them to fully 
experience and appreciate exhibitions. Their primary motive for using the digital guide is 
to gain a better understanding of the exhibits through detailed audio descriptions without 
the need for excessive phone interactions. 
 
3.3. User Personas 
The different expectations of each user group’s profile lead to a variety of needs that 
ought to be taken into consideration while designing the application. To help comply with 
usability principles and achieve user satisfaction, two user personas have been created 
to represent the two user groups mentioned in 3.2.: ‘Visitors with limited dexterity’ and 
‘Visitors with low vision’ which are visitors with visual disabilities and physical limitations 
associated with low dexterity. The persona writing follows Nielsen’s technique as 
described in Personas – User Focused Design [27] and aims to present the users as 
human beings rather than lifeless characters. Therefore, it consists of demographic data, 
technology and museum experiences, relationship with the field of Informatics and 
Telecommunications, and their personal needs and preferences in terms of the 
application use.  
By focusing on these specific personas, we aim to ensure that the MI&T digital guide 
application accommodates visitors with these disabilities and provides a seamless and 
inclusive experience.

3.4. User Scenarios 
In this section, we will present user scenarios for the personas mentioned in 3.3. 
representing each user group, to offer a detailed understanding of how different users will 
interact with the application. The scenarios will encompass a range of tasks and activities, 
highlighting the various features and functions of the app, and demonstrating how the 
app will assist the users in achieving their goals. 
 
3.4.1. Low Vision Scenario 
Alexis has been assigned to do a presentation for the course History of Informatics and 
Telecommunications regarding punched cards and their debut in business. He has 
gathered some theoretical content online but is struggling to paint a picture of how the 
punching worked. He learns that the MI&T hosts some relevant exhibits and decides to 
visit, even though he generally avoids museums due to his visual impairment. 
Upon arrival, he finds a braille sign explaining that there is an NFC tag to scan, which 
downloads the application of the museum and that earphones are recommended. Once 
installed, he is instructed to scan the “Example Tag,” where he practices using the 
supported gestures within the app, navigating through an exhibit’s page, and capturing a 
recording as a souvenir. 
When he reaches the museum’s relevant section, Alexis scans the “punched cards” 
exhibit tag to get audio guidance as he touches the cards and the punching equipment to 
understand how they operated. He listens to an audio description of the artifact, which 
enhances his understanding of the exhibit and its context. He pauses the guide and 
rewinds whenever he has trouble processing the information.  
To recall his visit and reflect on his observations later, he proceeds to record and save 
his audio souvenir, where he captures his personal reflections, along with the sounds 
produced by the equipment, a prerecorded summary of the exhibit and key points he 
plans to make in his presentation. 
 
3.4.2. Limited Dexterity Scenario 
Areti is in Athens with her daughter to explore university options, and they have planned 
to visit the MI&T to learn about the department's history and facilities. Areti faces 
limitations in physically interacting with exhibits that require delicate movements. 
Upon arrival, Areti is given a lanyard to attach to her device to minimize the strain that the 
grip causes her. She then scans the NFC tag at the entrance of the museum that triggers 
the application installation on her mobile phone. She proceeds to practice using the app's 
interface in the training mode to familiarize herself with the guide’s functionalities. To 
overcome her physical challenges, she takes advantage of the simple gestures provided 
by the application and places the phone in front of the NFC tags. Autoplay allows her to 
listen to the audio descriptions of the exhibits without compromising immersion.

Areti captures photos and videos of the exhibits, which she saves to later share with her 
husband, who was unable to join the trip due to work obligations. By the end of their visit, 
she has gathered plenty of information on the Department of Informatics and 
Telecommunications, its history, and its facilities, which render her able to aid her 
daughter in their decision-making process. 
 
3.5. Requirement Analysis 
Following the description of the user groups and the respective personas, we conducted 
a requirement analysis by examining the information gathered, drawing conclusions 
about their needs, translating them to requirements and, eventually, specifications for the 
user interface [28]. 
In this chapter, we will outline the design requirements and specifications for the 
museum's digital interface, taking into account the needs of the aforementioned 
personas, Areti and Alexis. These requirements are essential to the creation of an 
interface that is intuitive and accessible, successfully accommodates visitors' needs and 
provides seamless guidance that allows them to achieve their goals. The user interface 
specifications that are derived from these requirements aim to contribute to the design of 
an interface that renders the visitors’ experience educational and immersive for all visitors 
with minimal distractions and limitations.  
Table 3: Requirement 'Seamless Guidance' 
Title 
Seamless Guidance. 
Description 
To be able to access additional material with minimal 
interaction with the phone screen. 
Explanation 
Even though mobile phones are an affordable and 
convenient means to enrich the material given by the 
museum, visitors often lose focus and find themselves 
“absorbed by the device” when they constantly need to 
perform actions that require attention to their screen [4]. 
Hence the need to be able to follow the museum 
guidance without sacrificing immersion in the exhibits. 
In order to prevent uninformative interactions and avoid 
squandering visitors' time or effort, in the case of visitors 
with disabilities, the interface may treat the mobile phone 
as an object that triggers guidance-related actions. 
User Group(s) 
Visitors with low vision, Visitors with limited dexterity. 
Specification(s) 
- 
Installation of NFC tags on each exhibit. 
-

Table 4: Requirement 'Intuitive Gestures' 
Title 
Intuitive Gestures. 

Enhancing the museum experience through seamless and straightforward digital guidance 
R. Chiou 
32 
Description 
To execute actions within the app without depending on 
precise movements or voice commands, which could be 
difficult to achieve in a museum environment. 
Explanation 
To make the exhibit accessible to everyone, regardless 
of their level of technological proficiency or any 
disabilities they may have, the interface should include 
ways of navigating that are intuitive and easy to use. 
Both user groups may have difficulty selecting 
components within the app, and so there is a need for 
alternative ways of navigating, intuitive gestures. They 
must not require precise motions nor rely on timing 
because tapping on the screen with small intervals (i.e. 
for double tap) or extended periods of time (i.e. for tap 
and hold) can be challenging to people with fine motor 
limitations. According to Motti et al., 2013, older users 
with low manual dexterity or touchscreen users with no 
prior smartphone experience seem to take longer to 
select a target while tapping [29]. Aside from tapping, 
dragging interactions have been suggested for motor-
impaired users and older users with tremor due to the 
additional stability caused by the continuous contact with 
the screen [30].

Explanation 
Haptic feedback can provide a tactile response, such as 
a vibration or a buzz, to let the user know that their action 
has been registered and improve their interaction with 
the touchscreen [31]. This is important for visitors with 
low vision who may not be able to rely on visual cues 
alone, and for visitors with limited dexterity who may not 
be able to perform precise movements or rely on timing-
based interactions [32]. The feedback should be clear

Table 6: Requirement ‘Descriptive and Comprehensible Audio’ 
Title 
Descriptive and Comprehensible Audio. 
Description 
To understand the exhibit's content and follow the app's 
instructions as clearly as possible through audio. 
Explanation 
Visitors with low vision may struggle to perceive visual 
elements within the exhibit, making audio crucial to their 
experience. Descriptive audio content can provide a 
comprehensive understanding of visual elements, 
enabling individuals with low vision to access information 
that might otherwise be unavailable to them. 
As such, the app should provide deeply descriptive audio 
that accurately describes the exhibit's images, as well as 
clear audio instructions for navigating the app.

Table 7: Requirement ‘Clear and Accessible Typography’ 
Title 
Clear and Accessible Typography. 
Description 
To recognize text and outlines to the extent they are 
physically capable.  
Explanation 
While audio instructions will be provided (Requirement 
6), the design should be inclusive and provide clear, 
legible text that is easy to read in order to accommodate 
visitors with low vision to recognize as much content as 
they can. 
The typography should thus comply with Legibility 
Standards that make text accessible to low vision users 
according to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, also 
known as WCAG [33]. Specifically, the color contrast 
between text and background should be at least 4.5:1, 

Enhancing the museum experience through seamless and straightforward digital guidance 
R. Chiou 
34 
and the font size should be a minimum of 14 point for 
bold and 18 point for regular text. 
It is also important to choose a typeface with easily 
recognizable letters that avoid confusing similar shapes, 
such as lowercase “l” and uppercase “i” or the number 1, 
and uppercase and lowercase “c”, “o”, and “e” which 
often have narrow apertures [34]. A font that we deemed 
satisfies most of the above is Atkinson Hypereligible, 
created for the Braille Institute with the goal to improve 
legibility and readability for people with visual 
impairments by making each letterform visually distinct 
[35].

Table 8: Requirement ‘Tutorial Exhibit’ 
Title 
Tutorial Exhibit. 
Description 
To learn and try out supported gestures without

Explanation 
To make the app as accessible and user-friendly as 
possible, a tutorial exhibit should be included to teach 
visitors how to use the app's features and gestures. This 
will help visitors feel more comfortable and confident in 
their use of the app and reduce frustration due to missed 
information or disrupting other visitors in the museum. 
The tutorial exhibit should provide clear instructions and 
a safe space for visitors to experiment with app gestures 
before using them in the main exhibit. It should be 
designed to not interfere with the flow of other visitors in 
the museum and not cause unnecessary congestion. 
User Group(s)

3.6. Prototypes 
Building upon the requirements and specifications outlined in the previous section, series 
of high-fidelity prototypes for the museum's digital interface has been created. These 
prototypes represent an iterative design process that considers the needs of the target 
user groups and aims to provide an intuitive and accessible interface. The following 
paragraphs consist of screens that visitors may encounter during installation, as well as 
the main screens, including the welcome and home screen. Additionally, they feature 
exhibit audio description screens and souvenir screens, with varying modes and 
interfaces. 
The high-fidelity prototypes serve as a comprehensive representation of the proposed 
digital interface and have undergone multiple iterations in the attempt to seek balance 
amongst functionality, accessibility, and aesthetic appeal. A previous set of prototypes 
will be showcased below alongside with the various reasons their design was 
reconsidered in order to explore how they eventually lead to the final state. 
 
3.6.1. Museum Entrance 
As the visitors enter the Museum of Informatics and Telecommunications, they find an 
NFC tag with a Braille inscription, Figure 12, which initiates the installation of the 
application to their devices, as well as any additional equipment that they may require for 
their tour, such as earphones and lanyards for those who do not wish to grip their phones 
or have their hands occupied with a cane.  
 
Figure 12: Download App NFC Tag 
After the guide is successfully downloaded, visitors may be presented with initial screens, 
Figures 13 and 14, that prompt them to take specific actions, such as enabling NFC on 
their device and wearing earphones, before proceeding.

Figure 14: Wear Earphones Screen 
Once these requirements are fulfilled, the Welcome screen, Figure 15, provides an audio 
overview of the application and directs the users to the Tutorial Exhibit to familiarize 
themselves with the supported gestures. 
 
Figure 15: Welcome Screen 
The Tutorial Exhibit is a “placeholder” exhibit that allows visitors to practice navigating 
within the guide. It contains all the screens of the paragraphs below, just like any other 
exhibit within the museum.

When the tutorial phase is done, the Home Screen, Figure 16, appears and simply 
exists to remind the users that wherever they see a tag, they may scan it to enhance 
their experience.

The Exhibit Audio Description consists of two states; the “Playing” and the “Paused” state, 
Figure 18. Automatically, the application enters the “Playing” state once initiated and 
contains both text and audio instructions to accomplish basic audio controls with minimal 
interaction with the device’s screen. This way they may Touch anywhere in their Screen,

regardless of its duration or the number of touch points used, to pause or resume the 
audio content. They may also start over from the beginning by rescanning the tag.  
 
 
Figure 18: Exhibit Audio Description Screens 
 
3.6.3. Digital Souvenir Screens 
The museum exhibits come with basic information that visitors can enrich with their own 
perspective and save on their devices. This feature is referred to as the "Digital Souvenir" 
in this thesis and is composed of three modes: "Photo", "Video", and "Voice Memo". 
These modes offer visitors with varying needs and preferences the opportunity to express 
themselves creatively within the museum without adding complexity to their interaction 
with the guide. Visitors can switch between modes of the carousel menu by swiping the 
screen from either side. This is a commonly used interaction in the default camera 
applications of Android and iOS devices. 
To initiate the “Digital Souvenir” for an exhibit, they may tap the NFC tag placed by the 
“Audio Description” one, Figure 19.

First, permission to access the device’s storage is required to automatically save the 
media captured, as shown in Figure 20.

The “Photo” mode, Figure 21, allows visitors to take a single picture by touching their 
screen. Once the photo is captured, it will be saved to their device’s gallery. On the top 
of the camera is a text AR overlay with the museum’s name, the exhibit’s name and its 
basic information, the museum section, and the operational period.

Accordingly, the "Video" mode, Figure 22, enables visitors to record a video of the exhibit 
that they scanned with the "souvenir" tag. They initiate recording with a tap and finish it 
with another tap. Once recorded, the video is saved to their device's gallery. Similar to 
the "Photo" mode, the video is embellished with an AR camera filter featuring the MI&T 
logo and the exhibit’s primary information.

The “Voice Memo” mode, Figure 23, is an alternative to the prior “Digital Souvenir” types 
for visitors who may prefer to express their thoughts and observations verbally. To initiate 
recording, visitors simply tap on the screen and begin speaking. The recording ends with 
another tap and is automatically saved to their device's gallery. Similar to the “Photo” and 
“Video” modes, the "Voice Memo" mode features a pre-recorded voiceover that 
announces the name of the museum and the exhibit's basic information. This allows 
visitors to focus solely on their thoughts and ideas without worrying about providing 
additional context.

To return to the “Home Screen” and continue exploring the rest of the exhibits, the visitors 
slide until they reach the “Exit” option, Figure 24, and touch the screen to confirm their 
action.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this thesis, we have explored the design of a museum guide application that provides 
an intuitive user interface, minimizes distractions, and maximizes engagement for all 
visitors, including those with accessibility barriers.  
The analysis of related apps and their respective studies highlighted the importance of 
designing accessible and frictionless applications that enhance, rather than detract from, 
the museum experience. Through the development of user personas, we identified the 
needs and preferences of various user groups. We then used this information, along with 
findings from research on accessibility principles and natural interfaces, to gather 
requirements and specifications that would reflect said needs. It was deduced that the 
incorporation of NFC tags and intuitive gestures, along with haptic feedback, typography 
compliant with legibility standards, and descriptive audio, can contribute to rendering the 
interface seamless and inclusive. The resulting high-fidelity prototypes featured a 
simplistic interface that prioritizes limiting non-informative screen time and leverages 
Near Field Communication to trigger app workflows, allowing visitors to seamlessly 
engage with the museum's exhibits. 
While this research offers valuable insights into the design of museum guide applications, 
it has limitations.  
Future research should challenge the effectiveness of our design proposal by conducting 
usability testing with a broad range of visitors, including those with disabilities or limited 
familiarity with technology. By doing so, we expect to gain insights into the application’s 
intuitiveness, accessibility, and disruption from the cultural setting. This evaluation should 
be both quantitative, through first-click testing, completion rates and heatmaps, and 
qualitative, through interviews and the think-aloud protocol. Given that the actions within 
the app are triggered by the user’s interaction with physical tags, it is essential for the 
usability tests to be done in person and, ideally, within the museum setting.  
Following user testing, the development of the mobile application is expected. It should 
be implemented using a framework supporting NFC tag reading and accessibility 
features, namely React Native, which offers both an NFC library [36] and comprehensive 
Accessibility documentation [37] for both iOS and Android assistive technologies. The 
audio recordings should be stored in a data store and associated with unique identifiers 
to ensure the data is independent, modifiable, and not relying on the application’s 
updates. This will allow the app to quickly retrieve and play the audio file of the correct 
exhibit based on the ID attached to the NFC tag tapped. Once developed, it must be 
deployed and made available for download by visitors. 
In future redesigns of the application, we would encourage enriching its functionality while 
maintaining the principles regarding disruption and accessibility tackled in this study. For 
instance, visitors could be given the option to review their souvenirs prior to saving them 
and store them within the app instead of directly to their devices. Additionally, the feature 
to move to a specific time in an audio recording could be helpful for those who benefit 
from replaying specific audio clips, i.e., in the case of a university assignment or frequent 
loss of focus.  
Regarding accessibility, it is important to provide more personalized settings for visitors 
with disabilities, as their needs can range drastically. Such options could be adjustable 
haptic feedback, font sizes, contrast levels and audio speed. As reported by the research 
on the Warhol Museum's app, Out Loud [11], users with screen readers installed on their 
phones may struggle to perform tasks which may be straightforward to the average user 
due to the app overriding or ignoring the screen reader’s default gestures. For screen 
reader users, a single tap on the screen may translate to reading the selected item aloud,

making this functionality disruptive to the current design. Thus, we plan to adjust the 
application's functionality when a screen reader is detected, replacing single taps with 
gestures that screen reader users are accustomed to and utilizing OS-specific features 
such as “Magic Touch” [12]. This will ensure that visually impaired visitors can access the 
same content as sighted visitors without feeling excluded or disadvantaged.
