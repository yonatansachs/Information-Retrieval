abstract
the
current
rise
of
open
science
and
reproducibility
in
the
life
sciences
requires
the
creation
of
rich
machine-action
able
metadata
in
order
to
better
share
and
reuse
biological
digital
resources
such
as
datasets
bioinformatics
tools
training
materials
etc
for
this
purpose
fair
principles
have
been
defined
for
both
data
and
metadata
and
adopted
by
large
communities
leading
to
the
definition
of
specific
metrics
however
automatic
fairness
assessment
is
still
dif
ficult
because
computational
evaluations
frequently
require
technical
expertise
and
can
be
time-consuming
as
first
step
to
address
these
issues
we
propose
fair-checker
web-based
tool
to
assess
the
fairness
of
metadata
presented
by
digital
resources
fair-checker
offers
two
main
facets
check
module
providing
thorough
metadata
evaluation
and
recommendations
and
an
inspect
module
which
assists
users
in
improving
metadata
quality
and
therefore
the
fairness
of
their
resource
fair-checker
leverages
semantic
web
standards
and
technologies
such
as
sparql
queries
and
shacl
constraints
to
automatically
assess
fair
metrics
users
are
notified
of
missing
necessary
or
recommended
metadata
for
various
resource
categories
we
evaluate
fair-checker
in
the
context
of
improving
the
fairification
of
individual
resources
through
better
metadata
as
well
as
analyzing
the
fairness
of
more
than
25

as
way
to
considerably
simplify
meta-analyses
and
improve
the
statistical
power
and

of

it
also

or
more
recently
during

open
science
also
appears
to
be
an
essential
factor
in
limiting
the

and
environmental
impact
of
data
production
and

by
limiting

the
fair
fundamental
guiding
principles
have
been
defined
in
2014
by
the
force-11
group
and
published
in
2016
however
there
was
at
that
time
no
unified
recommendation
about
how
to
implement
these
foundational
principles
rapidly
after
the
need
has
emerged
to
evaluate
and
assess
the
fair
maturity
of
digital
resources
several
communities
have
produced
alternative
documents
to
guide
implementation
choices
and
converged
during
the
last
few
years
in
this
paper
we
particularly
refer
to
the
fair
data
maturity
model
specification
and
guidelines
published
in
2020
by
the
research
data
alliance1
and
to
the
convergent
interpretation
by
the
go
fair
foundation2
initially
the
fair
evaluation
of
resource
or
set
of
resources
was
mainly
done
through
questionnaires
which
have
the
disadvantage
of
being
time-consuming
and
requiring
certain
amount
of
experience
rapidly
enough
automatic
tools
have
been
developed
relying
on
various
implementations
of
the
fair
principles
the
first
one
was
the
fair
evaluation
services3
but
it
was
rapidly
followed
by
fair-shake4
and
f-uji5
the
scope
of
the
fair
principles
is
very
broad
and
therefore
impacts
wide
range
of
scientific
communities
for
example
an
expert
in
microscopy
image
analysis
needs
to
share
both
analysis
algorithms
and
reference
datasets
with
perennial
identifiers
and
controlled
vocabulary
specific
to
his
or
her
community
biologists
feeding
genomics
database
must
be
able
to
describe
the
provenance
of
their
sequences
and
samples
these
same
questions
arise
in
the
context
of
the
study
of
marine
biodiversity
for
example
thus
facilitated
access
to
wide
variety
of
semantic
tools
is
needed
if
we
want
to
engage
wide
variety
of
communities
towards
fairer
resources
semantic
web
technologies
seem
to
respond
precisely
to
this
need
although
some
findability
and
accessibility
principles
are
difficult
to
implement
with
semantic
web
technologies
such
as
long-term
persistence
of
identifiers
or
indexing
by
web
search
engines
if
we
leave
aside
google
dataset
search
most
of
the
interoperability
and
reuse
principles
can
actually
be
addressed
with
already
established
semantic
web
standards
technologies
in
this
paper
we
propose
fair-checker
as
tool
leveraging
knowledge
graphs
and
semantic
web
technologies
with
the
goal
of
making
producers
and
developers
of
scientific
digital
resources
more
accountable
and
efficient
in
their
fair
implementation

our
main
motivation
for
developing
new
fair
maturity
assessment
tool
was
to
meet
user
needs
and
go
beyond
simple
scoring
system
improving
the
discoverability
interoperability
and
reuse
of
biological
resource
requires
specific
technical
skills
and
an
understanding
of
fair
principles
we
wanted
to
develop
tool
based
on
knowledge
graphs
that
facilitates
the
selection
of
appropriate
ontology
terms
to
enrich
the
metadata
of
web
resources
working
in
the
context
of
research
infrastructure
for
bioinformatics
developing
services
for
health
plant
sciences
and
agronomy
communities
we
identified
typical
user
profiles
data
producers
software
developers
and
repository
developers
these
users
typically
use
the
web
as
an
infrastructure
to
access
and
publish
fair
digital
scientific
resources
most
of
the
time
these
people
are
not
trained
to
implement
the
fair
principles
and
have
to
learn
how
to
do
it
on
the
job
as
motivation
we
consider
the
following
three
use
cases
uc1
selecting

repository
in
this
use-case
data
producers
want
to
select
public

repository
dataverse
or
zenodo
for
instance
for
publishing
given
dataset
they
can
use
fair-checker
to
compare
the
fair
compliance
of
several
solutions
to
do
so
they
simply
need
to
submit
to
fair-checker
randomly
selected
identifiers
of
any
dataset
hosted
by
the
repositories
and
compare
fair-checker
analysis
reports
this
is
very
fast
and
does
not
require
any
particular
semantic

expertise
uc2
sharing
software
software
developers
wishing
to
provide
access
to
particular
tool
on
the
web
can
create
an
early
version
of
their
website
and
submit
its
provisional
url
for
analysis
by
fair-checker
the
analysis
report
will
provide
not
only
an
initial
fairness
assessment
of
their
resource
but
also
recommendations
to
improve
its
compliance
with
the
fair
principles
after
making
the
necessary
changes
the
developers
will
be
able
to
test
their
website
again
and
see
the
improvements
in
such
use-case

rapid

whether
any
of
them
can

for
the
three
use-cases
first

of

one
can
first
cite
fair

from
fairsfair6
which
is
simple
on-line
questionnaire
which
helps
researchers
and
data
managers
assess
how
much
they
know
about
fair
requirements
for
datasets
thus
it
cannot
be
used
to
score
and
compare
resources
with
respect
to
their
compliance
with
fair
principles
as
in
uc1
other
questionnaires
have
been
compared
in
2019
by
the
rda
fair
data
assessment
working
group
10
showing
great
heterogeneity
in
the
way
questions
are
expressed
for
the
same
principles
note
that
this
preliminary
work
certainly
inspired
the
rda
guideline
document
11
released
in
2020
in
the
rda
2019
survey
12
tools
were
studied
including
11
questionnaires
and
only
one
automated

see
below
from
these
11
questionnaires
only
have
evolved
to

it
provides

moreover
no

is
provided
for
improving
the

as
expected
in

now
merged
in

the

moreover
suggestions
for
improving
the

manual
fair
assessment
through
questionnaires
has
great
value
for
training
and
propagating
good
understanding
of
fair
principles
it
should
be
noted
that
the
field
has
evolved
lot
and
many
early
questionnaires
are
no
more
available
on-line
as
they
required
constant
updating
of
fair
principles
and
fair
metrics
definition
regarding
our
use-cases
however
questionnaires
are
clearly
not
the
right
solution
mostly
because
manual
answering
would
be
tedious
for
uc1
but
also
because
it
would
require
good
prior
knowledge
of
the
fair
principles
by
the
software
developer
in
uc2
and
because
in
uc3
the
resource
publisher
needs
detailed
analysis
of
the
metadata
content
associated
with
the
web
pages
of
his
catalog
which
cannot
be
provided
by
questionnaire
the
second
group
of
fair
assessment
tools
are
automatic
tools
which
implement
fair
maturity
index
metrics
the
fair
evaluator
system
is
the
result
of
community-driven
effort
promoted
by
the
go-fair
initiative10
with
the
goal
of
defining
fair
metrics
soon
renamed
fair
maturity
indicators
mi
and
to
develop
an
automatable
framework
to
discover
access
and
interpret
the
content
of

today
the
online
fair-evaluator
front-end11
offers
the
possibility
to
import
mi
tests
to
create
collections
of
tests
and
to
evaluate
given
resource
an
api
is
also
available
to
access
the
tests
through
custom
programs
regarding
the
online
tool
each
data
resource
has
to
be
tested
individually
user
needs
to
provide
an
identifier
such
as
orcid
for
example
results
are
provided
with
full
log
information
which
is
particularly
useful
when
fair
mi
test
has
failed
in
order
to
understand
what
is
wrong
in
the
tested
resource
however
no
recommendation
is
given
to
fix
the
problem
and
improve
the
resource
fair-shake

users
the
selection
of
appropriate

be
very
complex

for
developers
who
are
not
familiar
with
uc3
enriching
metadata
for
registries
repository
developers
maintaining
catalog
of
web-accessible
resources
may
wish
to
enrich
the
metadata
content
associated
with
each
web

in
their
catalog
they
may
take
advantage
of
metadata
profiles
adapted
to
their
community
needs
they
will
submit
several
pages
to
fair-checker
to
inspect
the
quality
of
associated
metadata
fair-checker
should
return
useful
advice
on
how
to
comply
with
existing

the

can
then
easily
propagate

in

automated

are
key
to
empower

they
are
also
key
to
systematically
evaluating

at

however
the
reviewed
approaches
only
partly
answer
the

identified
in
use-cases
uc1
first
they
do
not
yet
provide
technical
recommendations
to

then
they
do
not
propose
to
inspect
the

of

with
respect
to
the
use
of
community
agreed
ontologies

as
well
as
the

this
is
particularly
attractive
to
technically

the
general

also

bioschemas

specify

they
specify

this
was
motivation
to
include

these

it
contains
discussion
and
conclusion
in
this
paper
we
introduce
fair-checker
as
web
tool
that
makes
semantic
technologies
and
knowledge
graphs
accessible
to
non-expert
users
to
develop
the
usage
and
improve
the
quality
of
metadata
thus
contributing
to
the
adoption
of
fair
principles
in
practice
due
to
the
genericity
of
fair
principles
and
their
nontechnical
specifications
their
implementation
is
highly
dependent
on
human
interpretation
we
have
clarified
our
technical
choices
in
section
approach
since
there
is
an
important
overlap
between
fair
and
semantic
web
principles
we
shared
some
semantic
web
implementations
between
multiple
fair
metrics
however
the
assessment
of
few
fair
principles
is
kept
for
future
works
the
a2
principle30
addressing
long-term
preservation
is
clearly
out
of
the
scope
of
semantic
web
technologies
f331
is
hard
to
assess
since
there
is
no
consensus
on
the
appropriate
vocabulary
nor
on
the
associated
cardinality
constraints
aimed
at
unambiguously
identifying
data
regarding
i2
see
table
although
recent
propositions
concern
the
fair
assessment
of
ontologies
27
29
to
our
knowledge
the
resulting
strategies
have
not
yet
been
integrated
into
registries
such
as
bioportal
30
or
fairsharing
31
we
are
aware
that
our
list
of
terms
to
be
evaluated
by
fair-checker
is
limited
albeit
founded
on
common
usage
in
the
semantic
web
community
as
well
as
more
focused
efforts
such
as
hcls

or

propose
to
capture

general

consist
in

which
propose

we
envisage
as
future

to

these

this

is
used
as
part
of
the
training
courses
of
the
french
institute
of
bioinformatics
targeting
biologists

bioinformaticians
its
national
deployment
will
be
accelerated
by
the
high
expectations
of
national

for
the
development
of
open

in
line
with
the
bioschemas
initiative
which
addresses
the
issues
of

discoverability
quality
and
maintenance
fair-checker
already
targets
large
international
community
of
users
and
developers
although
the
notion
of
ontologies
for
the
classification
of
biological
objects
and
their
annotation
with
controlled
terminology
is
well-known
in
the
life
science
community
the
underlying
knowledge
graph
standards
and
technologies
such
as
rdf
sparql
or
shacl
are
still
unfamiliar
and
difficult
to
learn
in
the
context
of
more
open
and
reproducible
sciences
evaluation
tools
such
as
fair-checker
allow
building
bridges
between
these
technologies
and
large
communities
the
genericity
of
our
approach
through
template
sparql
queries
and
template
shacl

makes
it
possible
to
evaluate
fair
principles
and
more
deeply
community-specific
metadata

beyond
life
sciences
to
further
promote
the
adoption
of
semantic
web
technologies
by
large
communities
progress
on
identification

relations
must
be
made
although
this
represents
challenging
task
an
increased
use
of
sameas
links
in
web
page
metadata
could
make
it
easier
to
exploit
public
knowledge
graphs
and
as
result
reduce
the
cost
of
annotating
individual
web
pages
the
popularity
of
lightweight
ontologies
dedicated
to
resource
discovery
on
the
web
schema
org
raises
concerns
about
the
quality
of
these
