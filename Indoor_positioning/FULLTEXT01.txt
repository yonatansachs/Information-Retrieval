226IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We provided an efficient system for indoor positioning.
Users of the system were pleased and excited by having
such an application where they could be helped by our
Indoor Taxi-Cab system to know the exact direction and
location in a complicated indoor environment where a
number of buildings are linked via tunnels and bridges.
The proposed system relies on a commercially launched
Ekahau indoor positioning product while obtaining the
users‚Äô coordinates based on Wi-Fi radio signal strength
measurements. Unfortunately, the system inherits the
Ekahau‚Äôs limitations related to performance and
pricing. Furthermore, the cost of mapping the campus along
Figure 5: User can request for a nearby item with licenses can be quite high.
Our future work includes testing alternative open source
systems to obtain the users‚Äô coordinates. Also, we intend to
extend the system and to develop our own Wi-Fi positioning
engine. Finally, we intend to port our system to iOS and
Windows 8.
In conclusion, the main problem is to balance the
performance load, how to distribute processing power
between the clients and server, and how to utilize limited
bandwidth.
