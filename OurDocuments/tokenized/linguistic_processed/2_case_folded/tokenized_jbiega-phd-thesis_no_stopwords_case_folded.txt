kurzfassung
ach
einer
zeit
schneller
fortschritte
den
fähigkeiten
digitaler
systeme
beginnt
die
gesellschaft
zu
erkennen
dass
systeme
die
menschen
bei
verschiedenen
aufgaben
unterstützen
sollen
den
einzelnen
und
die
gesellschaft
auch
schädigen
können
suchsysteme
haben
ein
erhebliches
potenzial
um
zu
solchen
unerwünschten
ergebnissen
beizutragen
weil
sie
den
zugang
zu
informationen
vermitteln
und
explizit
oder
implizit
menschen
immer
mehr
anwendungen
ranglisten
anordnen
da
sie
riesige
datenmengen
sowohl
über
suchende
als
auch
über
gesuchte
sammeln
können
sie
die
privatsphäre
dieser
beiden
benutzergruppen
verletzen
anwendungen
denen
ranglisten
einen
einfluss
auf
den
finanziellen
lebensunterhalt
der
menschen
außerhalb
der
plattform
haben
auf
sharing-economy-plattformen
oder
jobbörsen
haben
suchmaschinen
eine
immense
wirtschaftliche
macht
über
ihre
nutzer
indem
sie
die
sichtbarkeit
von
personen
suchergebnissen
kontrollieren
dieser
dissertation
werden
neue
modelle
und
methoden
entwickelt
die
verschiedene
aspekte
der
privatsphäre
und
der
fairness
suchsystemen
sowohl
für
suchende
als
auch
für
gesuchte
abdecken
insbesondere
leistet
die
arbeit
folgende
beiträge
wir
schlagen
ein
modell
für
die
berechnung
von
fairen
rankings
vor
bei
denen
suchsubjekte
entsprechend
ihrer
relevanz
angezeigt
werden
die
sichtbarkeit
wird
im
laufe
der
zeit
durch
ein
optimierungsmodell
adjustiert
um
die
verzerrungen
der
sichtbarkeit
für
sucher
zu
kompensieren
während
die
nützlichkeit
des
rankings
beibehalten
bleibt
wir
schlagen
ein
modell
für
die
bestimmung
kritischer
suchanfragen
vor
dem
für
jeden
nutzer
aanfragen
die
zu
seinem
nutzerprofil
den
top-k-suchergebnissen
führen
herausgefunden
werden
das
problem
der
berechnung
von
exponierenden
suchanfragen
wird
als
reverse-nearest-neighbor-suche
modelliert
solche
kritischen
suchanfragen
werden
dann
von
einem
learning-to-rank-modell
geordnet
um
die
sensitiven
suchanfragen
herauszufinden
wir
schlagen
ein
modell
zur
quantifizierung
von
risiken
für
die
privatsphäre
aus
textdaten
online-communities
vor
die
methode
baut
auf
einem
themenmodell
auf
bei
dem
jedes
thema
durch
einen
crowdsourcing-sensitivitätswert
annotiert
wird
die
risiko-scores
sind
mit
der
relevanz
eines
benutzers
mit
kritischen
themen
verbunden
wir
schlagen
relevanzmaße
vor
die
unterschiedliche
dimensionen
des
benutzerinteresses
einem
thema
erfassen
und
wir
zeigen
wie
diese
maße
mit
der
risikowahrnehmung
von
menschen
korrelieren
wir
schlagen
ein
modell
für
personalisierte
suche
vor
dem
die
privatsphäre
geschützt
wird
dem
modell
werden
suchanfragen
von
nutzer
partitioniert
und
synthetische
profile
eingefügt
das
modell
erreicht
einen
guten
kompromiss
zwischen
der
suchsystemnützlichkeit
und
der
privatsphäre
indem
semantisch
kohärente
fragmente
der
suchhistorie
innerhalb
einzelner
profile
beibehalten
werden
wobei
gleichzeitig
angestrebt
wird
die
ähnlichkeit
der
synthetischen
profile
mit
den
ursprünglichen
nutzerprofilen
zu
minimieren
viii
die
modelle
werden
mithilfe
von
informationssuchtechniken
und
nutzerstudien
ausgewertet
wir
benutzen
eine
vielzahl
von
datensätzen
die
von
abfrageprotokollen
über
soziale
medien
postings
und
die

vom

bis
hin
