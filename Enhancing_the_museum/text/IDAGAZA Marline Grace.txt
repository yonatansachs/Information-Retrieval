ABSTRACT 
 
Internet of things helps people to live and work smarter, as well as gain complete control over their 
lives. Humans obtain 83% of their knowledge by sight according to human physiology references 
and one out of 100 people is visually impaired in Rwanda. In secondary school one out of three 
children with disability is blind or visually impaired. Blindness causes challenges to perform 
different tasks including learning new skills and having fun. Accessing museums has been difficult 
for blind and visual impaired people. Some systems have been implemented to assist visually 
disabled people in museums with customized designs depending on different types of the museums 
and what they represent. Most of them focus on the use of other technologies such as smart sticks 
and wearable devices. However, they require additional cost and don’t provide the fully enjoyable 
experience of visiting museums for blind people. The aim of this study is to create a prototype that 
is simple, fast, accurate and cost-effective which enables visually disabled people to enjoy the 
museum experience and allow remote monitoring of the objects inside the museum. A headset is 
given to the user at the entrance of the museum; he is then required to use his sense of touch to 
explore the object.  By touching the object through the capacitive touch sensors that are connected 
to the object, the information is processed and presented in an audio format through the Bluetooth 
headsets. Also, this solution is used to monitor and control the museum environmental conditions 
such as; temperature and humidity which are the essential elements of collections care. The results 
obtained from the  prototype indicates that the temperature varies from 23.7°C  to 30°C and the 
humidity varies between 35% to 62 % due to the surrounding environment but the recommended 
temperature for museum items is 16°C to 20°C and the  humidity should not drop below 40% or 
rise above 70%, lowering the temperature greatly increased the longevity of collections and a change 
in humidity causes dimensional alteration in hygroscopic materials (for example wood, ivory, skin, 
and other organic materials), resulting in warping, splitting, and delamination of sensitive 
materials. The implemented system allows people who are visually impaired to learn and enjoy 
the museum experience so that they can be reintegrated in the society; it also prevent the damage 
of museum items materials of by controlling and monitoring the temperature and humidity.

CHAPTER I: GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
A museum is a place where cultural heritage is preserved by collecting and arranging different 
historical objects in a systematic order to tell the story of history [1]. The national museum of 
Rwanda is one of the treasures the country has, it holds information related to Rwanda history and 
all the objects related to that history. [2] It is difficult for a person to understand the layout of 
culture at a museum, exhibition, or heritage site, especially a blind or visually disabled person who 
cannot see. Museums also don’t have enough resources to guide and explain every object or 
exhibition to every single impaired person who visits the museum. 
The government of Rwanda ratified the Marrakesh treaty in September 2020, following members 
of parliament voting on a law approving Rwanda’s agreement to the Marrakesh treaty to facilitate 
access to published works for persons who are visually impaired or print-disabled on 22 July 2020 
[4]. Therefore, there are not enough resources or facilities which can help to monitor the museum 
and help the blind and visual impaired to have access to different kinds of arts. 
Since blind individuals rely on their sense of touch for a better understanding of the world they 
live in, this system helps them to have access to all information in museums through audible voices 
by touching different objects and exhibits that are in the museum. 
This system is also used to monitor any object in a museum to prevent any future damage and to 
optimize their environmental conservation conditions. 
In this thesis, we developed a low-cost, reliable system for visually disabled people which allows 
them to learn about different objects and events in the museums without anyone’s help and the 
same system is used by the museum managers or owners to control and monitor the environmental 
conditions such as temperature and humidity inside the museum. 
 
This project utilizes IoT infrastructure and devices such as Raspberry Pi, which is very energy 
efficient and easily portable, capacitive touch sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, memory 
cards, Bluetooth headsets and wireless networks. 
This research has been conducted at the national museum of Rwanda in order to understand current 
or historical events, conditions or practices that are present inside the museums in order to identify 

  
  
 
  
2 
the key elements which contribute to the success of the project. We chose three objects inside the 
museum to use as sample during the implementation of this project.  
 
 
 
                                            Figure 1 Igisabo 
Igisabo is a traditional Rwandan domestic object which were used for milk fermentation .it is also 
a symbol of wealth and luck in Rwandan culture.

Icumu was a one of the main instruments in the history of Rwanda which were used at war, it is 
also a symbol of strength and protection in Rwandan culture. 
 
                                                             Figure 3 Igiseke  
Igiseke is a type of traditional Rwandese woven basket. It is characterized by its flat circular base 
that is taller than it is wide, with a sloped conical fitted lid. It is traditionally made of native natural 
fibers in natural off-white colors with naturally-dyed patterns in colors like purple, green, black, 
yellow, and red.it were used to store crops or other objects in a traditional home. 
 
1.2 Background and Motivation 
 
Visually disabled people face many challenges in their daily lives, among those challenges we can 
mention the limited access to learning and entertainment materials such as museums. This can 
make them feel isolated in the society and they often fall behind others in term of learning about 
the history of the past or other objects which are in museums. Also museums don’t have a proper 
way of monitoring the temperature and humidity which are the essential elements of collections 
care.

1.3 Problem Statement 
 
One out of 100 people is visually impaired in Rwanda. In secondary school one out of three 
children with disability is blind or visually impaired. 
A museum plays a crucial role in preserving the culture of a given country; it is also a great place 
for different generations of people to visit for educational and entertainment purposes. The same 
way sighted people visits the museums, blind or visually impaired people have the right to enjoy 
the same experience too. 
Different institutions don’t take into consideration the needs of people affected by blindness or 
impaired vision, which denies them the same freedom to learn and enjoy this experience. There 
are limited resources and systems which can facilitate the blind and visually impaired people to 
navigate and learn about objects inside the museums. Some objects or exhibitions in museums are 
very old and precious but many museums don’t have an efficient system to monitor and control 
their environmental conditions in order to ensure the safe and preventive conservation conditions. 
Generally, some changes of temperature and relative humidity may cause serious damage to the 
objects.  
 
1.4 Aim and Objectives of the Project 
 
1.4.1. General objective of the project  
 
The Main goal of this project is to create an IoT-enabled solution which is used in Museums to 
help blind and visually impaired people to navigate and learn about different objects in museums 
and allow the monitoring of the environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature inside 
museum in order to protect the objects against damage.  
 
1.4.2 The specific objectives of this study 
 
The following are the specific objectives:  
o To assess the existing IoT-enabled solutions in order to find the available gaps. 

  
  
 
  
5 
o To design and implement a solution prototype to facilitate visual impaired people to 
have access to different objects in museums using a headset. 
o To monitor and control the museum environmental conditions such as humidity and 
temperature using different sensors and wireless networks. 
 
1.5 Hypotheses 
 
The hypothesis of this research are as follows: 
1) It is possible for visually disabled people to visit museums and learn about historical 
objects  
2) Internet of things can be used to build a prototype which can enable visually disabled 
people to the museum items  
3) This system can be used to keep data and monitor the environmental conditions inside the 
museum such as temperature and humidity.  
1.6 Scope and limitation of the study 
 
The research study is to design and implement IoT based system which assist blind and visual 
impaired people to have access to some educational and entertainment tools such as museums. The 
national museum of Rwanda was used as use case during the implementation of this project. We 
focused on three objects which have significant meaning in the culture of Rwanda in order to 
implement the prototype of the system, those objects are; Igisabo, Agaseke and Icumu.   
1.7 Significance of the Study Research questions 
 
The Rwanda Union of Blind (RUB), NCPDA (National council of persons with disabilities), 
Jordan foundation, HVP Gatagara and other people who are visually impaired especially students 
will benefit from this system because their members will be able to enjoy the museum experience 
and have a deep understanding of the objects and events inside the museums through audible play 
using a headset. The government of Rwanda will use this system to enhance ongoing national 
efforts to promote and realize the rights of persons who are visually impaired as Rwanda acceded 
to Marrakesh treaty to deepen inclusiveness of persons with disability on 25th, October, 2021. This 

  
  
 
  
6 
solution will also be used by the museum owners or managers to monitor and control the museum 
environmental conditions in order to avoid the deterioration of the objects.  
1.8 Organization of the Study 
 
The dissertation is organized in six chapters as following; The first paragraph contains the general 
introduction, it gives the study background, statement of the problems, objectives and study 
delimitation. The second chapter contains the literature review; it provides the review of the 
literature and similar studies and defines the gaps ignored by other authors and key terms used in

interpretation. The fourth chapter contains The System Analysis and Design that explain system 
models, proposed simulation models, and simulation scenarios. the fifth chapter explains the 
results and discuss of the result that describes the graphs result and hypothesis verification of the 
study. Finally, the sixth chapter contains the Conclusion and recommendations to other researchers 
who will be interested to work on the similar work.

CHAPTER II: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Introduction 
 
This section gives a brief analysis of other researches that are similar or related to our current 
research. This includes the problem investigated by the previous researchers, proposed technical 
solution, methodology approach used, and results found. Eventually, the gaps in the previous 
similar and related research were identified through this research study and these provide the 
justification and motivation for undertaking this research.

2.2 Review of the related work 
Different researches have been working on the development of IoT-based solutions which are used 
to assist blind and visually impaired people in their daily life. Most of the studies have focused on 
the use of wearable devices and virtual reality and the presentation of information in any form. 
This information is presented in text, audio, and video.  
Following are some of the proposed systems for blind people in museums and its monitoring 
system;

[5] A Museum for the Blind by Charlotte Coates; this paper shows how blind and visually impaired 
people are offered the chance to access a museum in a standard way. The Visitors explore with 
their hands by touching thee objects inside the museum. This museum exhibits artistic works that 
are experienced through a sense of touch. 
[6] Tools and technologies for blind and visually impaired Navigation support by Manish Mishra; 
this system provides the necessary navigation details by performing obstacle detection. Electronic 
Orientation Aids (EOAs) are designed to assist blind and visually impaired people in finding the 
navigation path. Position Locator Devices (PLD) are used to determine the precise position of 
devices that use the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) 
technologies and finally Electronic Travel Aids (ETAs) are general assistant devices for helping 
visually impaired people avoid obstacles. 
[7] An IoT-Enabled Information System for Smart Navigation in Museums by Muhammad Nawaz 
Khan, Haseeb Ur and Rahman Mohammad Faisal; This system uses wearable devices with image 
recognition algorithms and location-aware services, it arranges the artwork at the museum in a 
logical order so that visitors can easily determine where to begin, how to proceed, and where to 
end and finally It provides the information in an easy-to-read format (text, audio, and video) in a 
storytelling manner. 
[8] The talking museum by Flora Amato Angelo Chianese Antonino Mazzeo; the system uses 
Bluetooth-enabled technology which is deployed for searching to detect the location of user 
devices. The proposed model is composed of 1) WSNs, in which sensors are positioned on the 
objects or attached very near these objects 2) “Gateway Server” accumulates information from the 
sensors and base station; 3) “Multimedia Content Server” provides multimedia content on 
requesting the gateway server according to user choices; and 4) “Multimedia Guide App” is 
responsible for permitting the multimedia contents to the end-user according to his/her choices. 
[9] A novel challenge into Multimedia Cultural Heritage by Angelo Chianese, Fiammetta Marulli, 
Francesco Piccialli; this uses NFC (near field communication) technology for obtaining and 
providing multimedia content for users with links and suggestions. The NFC devices obtain data 
from other devices known as “passive token”. These passive tokens exchange information with 
NFC devices without physical contact. 
[10] Improving Smart Interactive Experiences in Cultural Heritage through Pattern Recognition 
Techniques by Angelo Chianese and Francesco Piccialli; this paper talk about the system which is 

  
  
 
  
9 
based on smartphones and smart watches for monitoring devices. For the recognition module, the 
system can also use RFID-based architecture. 
[11] Cultural Heritage and Internet of Things by Elizabeth M. Astorga González, Esteban Municio 
This paper represents the overview of existing IoT solutions used for cultural heritage cases, both 
to improve user experience and preventive conservation. It shows in IoT-based Cultural Heritage 
and its impact on real world objects. 
[12] Internet for Education-Online Audio Library for visual impaired people by Jean Benda 
Nkurunziza this system convert textbook into audio files and store them into an online database 
that is available to all blind learners.

2. The NFC devices obtain data from other devices 
known as “passive token”. These passive tokens 
exchange information with NFC devices without 
physical contact. 
Because this system

2.3 Gap Analysis  
 
 
Different researches worked on the development of solutions which are used to assist blind and 
visually impaired to navigate museums but according to the requirements and target group in our 
local museums, we have identified some gaps in those papers. 
In some thesis there is no use of IOT based solutions even though the solutions aim to assist blind 
visually disabled people, some systems use wearable devises which need extra budgets, as blind 
people rely mainly on their sense of touch some systems won’t allow the blind user to touch the 
objects which doesn’t allow them to fully enjoy the museum experience; some solutions which 
help blind people are limited to textbooks, other learning materials like objects, drawings are not 
included.

CHAPTER III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
3.1. Introduction 
This chapter explains various methodology and approaches used for data collection, preparation, 
evaluation and visualization. The IoT-enabled solution for museum monitoring and helping 
visually disabled people to navigate museum prototype was implemented using the prototyping 
methodology.  
3.2 Prototyping Methodology 
 
The main methodology used during the implementation of this project is the prototyping method. 
[13] It is a method in which the prototype is built, tested, and reworked until an acceptable 
prototype is achieved.  
In this study, the prototype is composed of three main parts, such as; the sensing, communication 
and visualization parts: 
i. 
The sensing part consists of data collection, different sensors such as temperature and 
humidity sensors are used to collect environmental data from the museum.  The capacitive 
touch sensors are used to sense if a person has touched an object. The data collected is 
processed by raspberry Pi and sent to cloud using communication protocol. 
ii. 
The Bluetooth headset are used so that the user can hear the audio description of events 
which are happening inside the museum through the headset and Wi-Fi is used for sending 
data on cloud for monitoring and visualization. 
iii. 
 The data is sent to cloud for visualization and monitoring of the output results.  
3.2.1 Prototyping model phases   
 
The prototyping model has following six phases which are [14]; 
1. Requirement Gathering and Analyst: the prototyping model starts with requirement 
analysis. In this phase, the requirements of the system were defined in detail, people who 
are visually disabled have been interviewed to know what their expectation from the system 
is. 

  
  
 
  
14 
2. Quick Decision: The second phase is a preliminary design or a quick design. In this stage, 
a simple design of the system was created. However, even if it was not a complete design, 
it helped in developing the prototype. 
3. Build a Prototype: In this phase, an actual prototype was designed based on the 
information gathered from quick design. It is a small working model of the required system. 
4. User Evaluation: In this stage, the proposed system was presented to a small group of 
visually disabled people and museum staffs for the initial evaluation. Comment and 
suggestion were collected from the users.  
5. Prototype Refinement: the prototype was changed according to the user’s feedback and 
suggestions. 
6. Implement product and maintain: the final system was developed based on the final 
prototype and it was tested.  
                                                   
                                     Figure 5 Prototyping model phases 
 The prototyping model has different benefits because it allows the users to be actively involved 
in development therefore, errors can be detected in the initial stage of the software development 
process so that the missing functionality can be identified which helps to reduce the risk of failure. 
The users provide quick feedback which helps to achieve better software development solutions 
and allow to find out the missing functionality in the system as well as understanding of the 
customer’s needs. This model also serves as a basis for deriving a system specification and may 
offer early training for future users of the software system.  
 
3.3 Context analysis 
 
Context analysis is the systematic analysis; identification, sorting, organization, interpretation, and 
communication of the data gathered in contextual inquiry, for the purpose of understanding the 

  
  
 
  
15 
work context for a new system to be designed [14]. the context analysis was done to understand 
how visually disabled people feel about visiting museums, understand how the designed prototype 
works and capture their suggestions so that the museum experience can be more enjoyable for 
them. The main technique used for context analysis is data collection.  
3.3.1 Data Collection and analysis techniques 
 
Data collection is a process used for gathering and analysing specific information to find solutions 
to relevant questions and evaluate the results. the main tool used for data collection are interview 
and archival research.  
Interview with focused group 
 
The interviews were conducted at an institution called HVP Gatagara, [13] an institution working 
in favour of persons with disability and whose objective is to promote the lives of those people 
and ensure an excellent education for Children with Disabilities thus allowing them to achieve 
good quality of life and enhance the process of reintegration. HVP has 4 branches which are 
located in different district of Rwanda. Rwamagana branch focuses on students who are visually 
disabled and help more than 200 students. I decided to work with 5 students from different districts 
of the country among those who were not in class at that time. 
 
 1. The interviewed student were asked if they have ever visited any museum 
This question was asked to the visually disabled students in order to see the level at which visually 
disabled student access museums. We wanted to know about the experience of those who have 
been there and the reason why others couldn’t visit museums and the obstacles they met so that it 
can contribute to the success of the project implementation. 
4 out of 5 students confirmed that they have never been to any museum and one student confirmed 
that he visited the national museum of Rwanda.

museum 
 
2. The interviewed students were asked if they wish to visit museums. 
This question was asked in order to see if visually disabled students are interested in exploring 
new places such as museums and to know if they understand the importance of visiting museums 

  
  
 
  
17 
so that we can measure the impact the proposed solution will have. 4 out of 5 students confirmed 
that they are really interested and would love to visit museums but one student insisted and said 
that he is not interested because he cannot see.

3.The interviewed student were explained how the prototype works and they were asked to 
give feedbacks.   
We explained how the designed prototype enables students who are visually disabled to enjoy 
the museum experience using their sense of touch and wanted to know what are their feedback 
and contributions.  
All students confirmed that the system is simple and well designed, they confirmed that it can be 
useful to them and help them enjoy the museum experience.

3.2.3 Archival research  
This research technique was conducted in order to know which different types of museums we 
have in Rwanda and which kind of information they offer. 
In Rwanda there are different types of museums with different stories or focuses, such as  
1. National museum of Rwanda which is located in Huye district, is the largest and most 
known of all the museums of Rwanda. The museum boasts of some of the best ethnographic 
and archaeological collections in East Africa of more than 10,000 artifacts. These materials 
include maps, photos, art objects and artifacts documenting hunting, fishing, basketry, 
pottery, textiles, woodcarving and metallurgy. [15] 
 
2. Kandt house museum in Kigali: which was named after Richard Kandt who was the first 
colonial governor of Rwanda, on behalf of Germany, until the early 1900s.the Kandt House 

  
  
 
  
20 
the kandt Museum comprises three main parts; the first part presents Rwandan life in all 
its aspects – social, economic, and political – before the colonial period; The second part 
traces the experience of the Rwandan people during the colonial period, Following the 
Berlin Conference in 1884, the Germans ruled Rwanda until 1916, when the Belgians took 
over under the League of Nations Mandate after World War I. Richard Kandt’s life and 
deeds in Rwanda are covered here; The third part covers the history of Kigali, before, 
during and after the colonial era. [16] 
3. Campaign against Genocide museum in Kigali offers deeper learning of the political 
events that led to the 1994 genocide. The parliament was chosen to host this space because 
it was the base for Rwanda Patriotic Army, it was dedicated to RPA soldiers who fought 
in the liberation war and it shows the war scene installations outside and audio and visuals 
inside. [17] 
4. Rwanda art museum in Kigali, Formerly the Presidential Palace Museum, this new 
museum displays contemporary artworks from Rwanda as well as abroad. The museum 
seeks to provide an insight into the originality of Rwandan creativity. Exploring the 
development of art from olden times to the modern day, it considers how traditional and 
modern imaginations can blend and fuse. [18] 
5.  King’s palace museum in Nyanza which is a reconstruction of the traditional royal 
residence, the King’s Palace is a beautifully-crafted thatched dwelling shaped like a 
beehive.it was placed in Nyanza which was considered as the heart of Rwanda in olden 
times. The museum explains some of the architectural idiosyncrasies inside the royal 
compound and other traditional events which were practiced at the royal palace. [19] 
6. Museum of the environment in Karongi Based near Lake Kivu in the Western Province, 
the Museum of the Environment covers two floors with a traditional herbal medicine 
garden on the rooftop. It is the first of its kind on the continent, the museum looks at 
renewable and non-renewable sources of energy. It is an educational museum and Its 
purpose is to help people understand and safeguard their environment, and ensure 
integrated and durable development. [20]  
This archival research has been conducted in order to understand the current or historical events, 
practices and different focuses of different museums in order to identify the key elements which 
contributes to the success of the project.

connected to different capacitive touch sensors which are also connected to different 
objects inside the museum. If someone has touched the object, then the audio records 
describing that same object which are stored on a memory card inside the raspberry pi will 
be played through the Bluetooth headset. 
 
2. This IoT-Based solution will also be used to control and monitor the museum’s 
environmental and material conditions such as temperature and humidity and it will also 
be used to alert the staffs or admin in case the temperature or humidity level is critical. 
Different sensors will be used such as, humidity sensor, and temperature sensor will be 
deployed inside the museum. The data will be monitored on dashboard cloud platform.

CHAPTER V. RESULTS ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION  
5.1 Introduction 
This section describes step-by-step the analysis of the results obtained after the implementation 
phase is completed and the brief discussion of those results. 
 
5.2 Cloud platform dashboard and visualization 
 
After processing, the data is sent via Wi-Fi to the cloud for monitoring and visualisation. The 
dashboard called Museum Monitoring system was created and the user has to create an account so 
that he/she can access the system.

5.2.1 System dashboard  
                                                   
After creating an account to the museum monitoring system the user has access to the dashboard 
which shows all the items which are in the museum, in this case we have three items which are 
igisabo, icumu, and igiseke which are numbered as item number 1, item number 2, and item 
number 3 on the graph. The graph shows how many times each object has been touched and when 
(time) it has been touched. 
 As shown, by the below graph, item 1 Igisabo was touched 23 times, item 2 Icumu was touched 
35 times and item3 igiseke was touched 36 times from 3:44 to 6:48 pm.  
 
 
                                                                   Figure 18 System dashboard

5.2.3 General Report  
 
The museum monitoring system has a report section where a system user can view a general 
report when it is needed. The report can be exported in pdf format and it contains data of all 
museum items as well as the variation of temperature and humidity. As shown by the table below 
each time an object is touched inside the museum, the time and date are captured, the 
temperature and humidity data are also captured and an Identification number is created to 
differentiate those different actions.

Table 6 General report 
 
 
 
5.2 Humidity and temperature results discussion  
 
Fluctuating relative humidity causes stress on materials. The fluctuation in humidity damages a 
wider range of museum objects, a change in humidity causes dimensional alteration in hygroscopic 
materials (for example, wood, ivory, skin, and other organic materials), resulting in warping, 
splitting, and delamination of sensitive materials. Seasonal slow drifts are less harmful to structures 
and objects than abrupt changes. High humidity (above 70%) can cause mold growth and metal 
corrosion. Low humidity (below 40%) can cause embrittlement of hygroscopic materials such as 
leather and paper. This prototype is built such that if the humidity is below 40% or 70% the buzzer 
is activated to notify that the level of humidity is critical inside the museum. While testing this 

  
  
 
  
39 
prototype the humidity varies between 41%-81% depending on the area of testing.  
Temperature is the major factor in the speed at which "natural aging" occurs. Materials last longer 
at cooler temperatures. A rapid change in temperature, if the relative humidity is constant, may 
have damaging effects on stressed metals, stone, films, plastics or wax, materials from which many 
modern collections are made. High temperatures increase deterioration reaction rates and melt 
heat-susceptible materials. The temperature inside the museum should be 16 to 20°C. This 
prototype is built such that if the temperature is below 16 °C or above 20°C the buzzer is activated 
to notify that the level of temperature is critical inside the museum. While testing this prototype 
the temperature varies between 23 °C and 30% according to the testing area. 
 
 
5.3. Prototype efficiency 
 
This solution is simple, fast, accurate, cost-effective, user-friendly, and it was designed according 
to the requirement of the visually disabled people who are based here in Rwanda and as per the 
nature of the national museum of Rwanda.  
The prototype is made of three main sensors; the capacitive touch sensor which are also connected 
to different objects inside the museum, collect data when someone has touched the object then the 
audio records describing that same object is played through the Bluetooth headset and the user 
who cannot see will be able to hear the audio description. the prototype has also the DH11 sensor 
which collect temperature and humidity data from the museum in order to avoid the damage of 
material conditions of the museum items.   
The prototype is efficient and accurate in such way that when the temperature or humidity level 
are critical the museum staffs are alerted using a buzzer which is connected to Raspberry Pi in 
order to ensure the real time response.

CHAPTER VI: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
6.1 Conclusion 
In this thesis, Internet of things has been used as a powerful tool to design and implement a system 
which helps visually disabled people to enjoy the museum experience. This thesis explains the 
impact of the use of IoT and the positive impact it has on the socio -economic plan in our society.  
It has been proven that sight is not the only sense with which people can experience and enjoy 
museums, this experience can also be enjoyable through the sense of touch using IoT technologies 
and visually disabled people can benefit from it. Also we have seen that the solution will help in 
terms of control and monitoring of the environmental conditions of the objects which is an 
advantage for museums staffs and owners in order to avoid the materials damage. 
IoT-enabled solution for Museum Monitoring and Visually Disabled People Navigation System 
allow people who are visually impaired to enjoy the museum experience which can increase the 
museum income and allow them to learn and to be reintegrated in our society. It increases 
awareness of blind people’s obstacles and needs so that other projects can be done in their favour. 
 
6.2 Recommendation 
 
Different systems have been put in place to help people with disabilities but we still have a big gap 
in terms of helping those people. With the use of IoT technologies, I believe that more can be done 
to help those people. I would like to recommend future researchers to work on new tools and 
systems which can be used to help visually disabled people or other people with disabilities to 
have access to educational and entertainment tools so that they cannot be left behind in our 
community.
