Abstract. 
As of 2020, an estimated 14.1 million residents of the United Kingdom reported a 
disability (DWP 2020). Within this population, approximately 6.1 million people have 
a hidden disability (Buhalis and Michopoulou 2011). These hidden disabilities range 
widely, from neurodiverse conditions like autism and dyslexia to long term chronic 
conditions such as fibromyalgia and arthritis. Due to the wide range of disabilities 
and their impact on a disabled person’s life, they have generally been 
underrepresented in accessibility studies.  
 
This thesis uncovers the accessibility needs of people with hidden disabilities, 
specifically in museums and heritage sites where they have heretofore mostly been 
overlooked. I utilise semi-structured interviews and correspondence with people with 
hidden disabilities, as well as participant-led experiences through three case study 
sites in Northern England, to understand the barriers they face. Their experiences 
help me expose the importance of passive accessibility – accessibility measures built 
directly into an exhibition design, such as adequate lighting and personal 
interpretation boards. 
 
Additionally, this thesis aims to understand the cultural forces that prevent or support 
accessibility-related improvements to such sites from taking place. By studying the 
cultural make-up of each case study organisation through ethnographic observations 
of the staff at these sites, institutional roadblocks to enacting accessibility-related 
adjustments are revealed. Specifically, the lack of communication at these sites 
presents a significant barrier to enacting accessibility suggestions from disabled 
visitors. 
 
Tying together the themes of active/passive accessibility and lack of communication 
is the theme of gaps in disability awareness, by which I mean that heritage 
organisations do not wilfully create these barriers to inclusion, and yet they create 
them still because they simply do not realise these things. Filling these gaps opens 
up countless possibilities for improving accessibility not only for people with hidden 
disabilities but for all visitors and staff at museums and heritage sites.

Preface. 
As a child, I always looked forward to our annual school trips to the Field Museum in 
Chicago. As a child with undiagnosed anxiety and OCD, I also found them... 
challenging.  
 
I loved walking through the marble-filled main hall, marvelling at the massive 
dinosaur skeleton, taxidermized elephants, and imposing totem pole. I especially 
loved walking through the replica Egyptian pyramid, following the twisted corridors 
up and down the structure, finally emerging into an immersive recreating of Ancient 
Egypt, complete with a fake river that ran along one end of the exhibition hall. The 
Egyptian exhibit was filled with hands-on, interactive activities, something that was 
unheard of in the early 1990s. Children could run around the hall, pretending to draw 
water from the fake river or grind wheat with replica quern stones. They could marvel 
at precious artefacts safely encased behind glass whilst running their hands all over 
replicas sat right in front of them. 
 
However, the combination of hard floors, stone walls, and wooden cabinets also 
meant that the exhibition hall was very, very loud. Any museum visitor who has 
encountered a school group will tell you how loud these groups can be, but as one of 
the school children, I spent every field trip feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and 
desperate to go home. My only respite was a tucked away corner of the Egyptian 
hall, with a faux mud brick alcove protecting the area on three sides. There were no 
interactive elements in this area, nothing to touch or play with, so most other children 
avoided the area. I, however, would happily spend days in that area. Not only 
because the faux mud brick walls held mummified animals and statues of the 
goddess Bastet that I could stare at for hours, but also because I could escape the 
overstimulation I experienced in the rest of the exhibit.  
 
Little wonder, then, that 25 years on, I'm now working in museums and striving to 
find more tucked away corners to shelter visitors who need the respite. This thesis is 
my way of proving everyone can be included in heritage, and that no one needs to 
experience a bad field trip due to ableist barriers.

When I first suggested to Sara that I wanted to pursue a PhD, she very seriously 
warned me that the process would change me. Without a doubt, I have become a 
different person in the four years it has taken me to complete this research. There is 
no possible way I could have accomplished this alone. 
 
First and foremost, thank you to my participants, especially those who have since 
become friends, for trusting me with your stories. You have challenged me and 
opened my mind to new ways of seeing the world, and I am forever grateful that you 
shared your experiences with me. 
 
Second, I have to thank my thesis advisory panel – Dr Gill Chitty, Dr Heather Smith, 
and of course, Dr Sara Perry. The wisdom, insight, and grace you wonderful women 
have shown me over the years is astounding, and has pushed me as a writer, an 
academic, and a person. I hope I can be even a fraction as brilliant as each of you 
are. 
 
To Harald and our beloved late Don, thank you for joining this project so late in the 
game, when personal circumstances meant I needed a little more help. 
 
To my friends and family, the support you’ve given me has been incredible. I have 
never felt like I’m bothering you if I needed to rant or vent or sob, despite my 
mounting anxiety over, well, everything. 
 
Finally, to my Diglets. You, more than anyone else, have listened to me prattle on 
about accessibility for years. Not only that, you’ve taken my rantings and put them 
into practice, to the point that you’re teaching me things about accessibility now. I’m 
so very proud to be amongst your ranks.

Chapter 1 – Introduction. 
 
It all starts with a simple comment.1 
 
I’m telling my friend Renee about a trip I’m planning to a museum in a different 
city, and that I've spent the past hour searching their website for every last bit of 
information I can find to prepare myself. 
 
"Oh man," Renee says. "You have it lucky – you have no idea the ridiculous 
level of planning I have to do, just to visit a museum in my own city." Renee is a 
professor of Art History in the midwestern United States, a published academic, 
and an artist herself. She also has Type 1 Diabetes. By this point, my interest in 
museum accessibility has taken root, and we have had long discussions about the 
impact of diabetes on her life. 
 
Curious, I ask her what she means. 
 
"Well, for starters, I have to make sure I have extra insulin," she begins. She 
spends the next half an hour explaining to me the excruciating level detail she 
has to plan, everything from what shoes to wear (Type 1 Diabetes is notoriously 
hard on feet (Bowling, Rashid and Boulton 2015)) to where the nearest hotel is 
in case she's too ill to travel home and has to stay the night to recover. And this 
is only for a trip to the other side of her own city.  
 
She then tells me multiple stories where she has almost been kicked out of an art 
gallery for quickly and unobtrusively eating a chocolate bar to prevent a blood 
sugar crash, which could lead to her passing out. More than once, a particularly 
harsh docent has reminded her that there's no eating or drinking in a museum – 
                                            
1 I begin this thesis with a “vignette” – a short narration based on real events, which I further define 
and discuss in Chapter 4.  

24 
 
as if she was an uneducated, unaware member of the public, and not a professor 
with a PhD in Art History.  
 
Finally, she turns to me with a sigh. "I just wish more people understood how 
difficult it is for people with hidden disabilities. There's a lot more to 
accessibility than ramps and Braille guides." 
 
Renee’s frustration over inadequate accessibility in museums and heritage sites is 
becoming an increasingly important issue, especially as the number of disabled 
people in the world continues to rise (World Health Organization 2011, 8). Heritage 
sites are now increasing their accessibility offers, providing everything from large 
print guides to specialised tours for people with specific disabilities, such as a BSL 
tour at the Tower of London (Historic Royal Palaces 2021). It is commonplace now to 
see a session or paper about accessibility at museum conferences, like at the 
Museums Association’s Exhibitionists: Design Great Exhibitions conference (Kufeldt 
2018) and sessions such as “Enabled Archaeology: Making Field and Museum 
Archaeology More Inclusive for Dis/Abled Staff, Volunteers, And Visitors” at CIfA’s 
2022 conference (Chartered Institute for Archaeologists 2021). There are even entire 
conferences dedicated to museum accessibility, like the Museums as Agents of 
Change: Diversity, Accessibility, and Inclusion conference in December 2017 (US 
Embassy 2017). The National Lottery Heritage Fund requires all applications to 
consider inclusion and accessibility as part of their funding process, and even 
provides guidance on how to make NLHF-funded projects more accessible (National 
Heritage Lottery Fund 2021). 
 
However, despite these advances, Renee’s comments still ring true for many 
disabled people. In 2018, 64% of disabled people believed that levels of access for 
them remained the same from the year before, with a further 17% believing 
accessibility had decreased (Euan’s Guide 2019, 6). Additionally, only 38% of 
disabled people are able to find the accessibility information they need online (Cock 
et al. 2020, 9), a startlingly low number given that 70% of disabled people actively 
seek this information before visiting a museum or heritage site (2020, 7) and more 
than half change their plans if they cannot find enough information regarding the 

25 
 
accessibility of a site (2020, 13). If accessibility is becoming a more common topic 
amongst heritage practitioners, why are disabled people not seeing any positive 
change? 
 
A great deal of this disparity comes from how disability is conceptualised, as this 
conceptualisation then informs how museums and heritage sites view accessibility. It 
is therefore necessary to discuss the various models of disability in order to 
understand these differing viewpoints. 
1.1. Models of Disability. 
The definition of "disability" in the general consciousness is a narrow one. Most 
people, when they consider disability, often think only of wheelchair users, people 
with sight loss, or the d/Deaf community2 (Hidden Disabilities 2021a). The British 
census takes a slightly different meaning, considering anyone who has their daily life 
impacted either "a little" or "a lot" by a health problem or impairment as disabled 
(Office for National Statistics 2015). The Government’s definition is a more inclusive 
conceptualisation, allowing for a wider range of conditions, such as chronic illnesses, 
mental health conditions, or a learning disability – disabilities that are often 
overlooked by the general population. 
 
As can be seen by the difference between the census statistics and the general 
knowledge of disability, there are varying perceptions regarding what disability is. In 
Disability Studies itself, there are various ways of understanding and defining 
“disability” that have formed different modes or “models” of disability. The earliest 
model to be articulated was the medical model, which first emerged in the 1970s and 
was cemented in disability studies with the publication of the WHO’s International 
Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (1980). Abbreviated as the 
ICIDH, it marked the first international attempt to classify disability to describe “the 
consequences of disease” (Üstün et al. 2003, 565). The model views disability as 
"any restriction or lack (resulting from impairment) of ability to perform an activity in 
                                            
2 This is the preferred term for the community. It indicates deaf people, who have severe hearing 
problems, are different from Deaf people, who have been deaf since before they learned to speak. 
Deaf people in turn consider sign language their first language, rather than the native spoken 
language of their wider society (Sign Health 2021). 

26 
 
the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being" (World Health 
Organization 1980, 28).  
 
This is very in-line with how most nondisabled people view disability: the person with 
the disability is lacking something that would otherwise make them normal. It is this 
'lack' that is intrinsic to the person. There is something that is missing or limiting the 
person, whether it is a lack of ability to climb a set of stairs or a restriction in how 
many stairs a person can climb before exhaustion sets in. In the definition itself, the 
disability is also contrasted against 'normal,' which again assumes that there is 
something lacking in the disabled person. Their disability is something that must be 
compensated for, traditionally using a technical or medical device, which is where 
this model takes its name. The burden of 'improvement' is still on the disabled 
person, who must somehow compensate for their disability in order to interact with 
the rest of the world. Examples of accessibility measures that stem from the medical 
model include prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and cochlear implants. They change the 
individual and allow them to be more 'normal' in the wider world. This framing of 
disability as a loss, as a restriction, also has profound impacts on how a disabled 
person is then viewed. As Cameron points out, "the terms loss, abnormality, 
restriction, or lack of ability are heavily laden with cultural meaning and indicate a 
perception of impairment and disability as characteristics of individual deficit or 
personal tragedy" (2014, 99). The medical model not only singles out a disabled 
person as abnormal, but also sets them up as a tragic figure for not reaching the 
heights of human normality.  
 
Despite its shortcomings, the medical model does put forward an important concept: 
impairment. Impairment refers to the “abnormalities of body structure and 
appearance and with organ or system function, resulting from any cause; in principle, 
impairments represent disturbances at the organ level” (World Health Organization 
1980, 14). Problematic wording aside, an impairment is the physical aspect of a 
disability. It is the eyes that cannot see, the brain that cannot process written text, 
the joints that are inflamed. In many cases, these impairments lead to disability, but 
not always. For example, I am short-sighted and have worn glasses or contact 
lenses for over 30 years. According to the medical model of disability, my inability to 
clearly see anything more than six inches from my face represents a “restriction or 

27 
 
lack (resulting from impairment) of ability to perform an activity” (World Health 
Organization 1980, 28) and therefore is a disability.  
 
However, I do not consider my short-sightedness a disability – thanks to the social 
model of disability.  
 
In opposition to the medical model sits this social model of disability, which presents 
disability as a restriction imposed by society, rather than inherent in the person. The 
Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS), a society of 
physically disabled people who began to organise in the 1970s, first theorised the 
social model and became its primary advocate. They define disability as "the 
disadvantage or restriction of activity caused by a contemporary social organisation 
which takes little or no account of people who have physical impairments and thus 
excludes them from the mainstream of social activities" (UPIAS 1975, 20). My short-
sightedness does not exclude me from mainstream social activities, hence why I do 
not consider it a disability. 
 
The social model of disability shifts the source of disability off the person and onto 
society, a difference that can be at least partially explained by the fact that this 
definition has been written and shaped by disabled people themselves. It has been 
created by the people who have embodied knowledge of disability rather than 
medical professionals (Oliver 2013, 1024). Here they resist the idea the medical 
model puts forth, that their disability is something that makes them lesser and that it 
is their onus to change. Rather, disabled people see their 'disabilities' merely as 
impairments that society has changed into disadvantages. One of my participants, 
Jessica, spent almost all her education with undiagnosed neurodiversity, something I 
explain in greater detail in Chapter 5. Her dyslexia meant that Jessica found it 
difficult to read and write to the same standard as her peers. The social model says 
that Jessica is not disabled because of her dyslexia, but rather because society 
places Jessica in situations where she is inherently disadvantaged – that is, she is 
put into educational settings without any support. As Jessica herself said, in this 
setting, she thought “I was just stupid and just needed to work harder. And actually, 
that was not the case” (Appendix C 7.1). In other words, she once found herself 
burdened by the medical model wherein her “abnormality” was situated firmly within 

28 
 
Jessica herself. However, she has now come to situate her disability within the social 
model, and subsequently realised “it’s not because I’m stupid, I have a disability and 
I need some extra tools for me to be able to read and excel in studying” (Appendix C 
7.1). 
 
It is this social model that has pushed through legislation (Barnes 2006, 13) and 
cultural changes, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. By framing 
disability as a problem with society, it is society that must adapt to people with 
impairments. Initiatives like universal design and inclusive environments, as well as 
disability awareness programs (e.g., Enhance the UK or Disability Matters), are 
borne from this social model and encourage a world that is more open and inclusive 
of impairments, wanting wheelchairs and accessible toilets to be as common and 
everyday as prescription glasses.  
 
However, the social model has numerous flaws. Most significantly is a complete 
disconnect between disability and impairment. As discussed earlier, this distinction 
between disability and impairment was an important part of the medical model. In the 
social model, there is no consideration of impairment at all. This seems a natural 
conclusion if society is wholly to blame for disability. If society is what needs to 
change, then there is nothing "wrong" with a disabled person. However, as many 
disabled people will attest, they do have, for example, an organ that does not 
function as it was intended. Someone with Type 1 diabetes has a pancreas that does 
not control insulin like it should, yet a strict social model interpretation would not see 
this as a disability. This distancing between disability and impairment is necessary 
on some level, as it challenges the idea that all disabled bodies need to be cured, 
but the two cannot be completely disengaged from each other. Appropriately for this 
research, Wendell (2001, 23) points out that “recognition of impairment is crucial to 
the inclusion of people with chronic illnesses in disability politics. Chronic illness 
frequently involves pain, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, weakness, depression, and/or 
other impairments that are hard to ignore.” 
 
There are also examples of disabilities being hypothesised as beneficial to humans 
in the past. Spikins’ (2013; 2010) ground-breaking work on autism in prehistory 
suggests that it was autistic characteristics that helped individuals to survive and 

29 
 
adapt during the Palaeolithic. In this way, the social model of disability is accurate: it 
is society that makes these impairments productive or not. However, the social 
model fails to account for the practical, daily ramifications of living with these 
conditions. Someone with Type 1 diabetes will still need insulin, and no amount of 
social awareness will change that (Wendell 2001, 18). To ignore very real medical 
needs entirely is not only a shortcoming of the social model, but also a dangerous 
one. As Mulvaney writes, “the social approach to disability must acknowledge the 
legitimacy of medical activities while, at the same time, critiquing these activities 
where appropriate if it is to identify the full range of social barriers people with 
disabilities face” (2000, 594). 
 
As a way of addressing these shortcomings, Swain and French (2000) put forward 
the affirmation model of disability. They stress that it is not an alternative to the social 
model, merely that it builds on its principles and further refines the ideas already set 
out (578). Most significantly, it soundly rejects the intrinsic idea that to be disabled is 
to be a tragic figure. As the authors (2000, 578) write: 
An affirmative model is being generated by disabled people through a rejection of the 
tragedy model, within which their experiences are denied, distorted or re-interpreted, 
and through building on the social model, within which disability has been redefined. 
The affirmative model directly challenges presumptions of personal tragedy and the 
determination of identity through the value-laden presumptions of nondisabled 
people. It signifies the rejection of presumptions of tragedy, alongside rejections of 
presumptions of dependency and abnormality. Whereas the social model is 
generated by disabled people’s experiences within a disabling society, the affirmative 
model is borne of disabled people’s experiences as valid individuals, as determining 
their own lifestyles, culture and identity. The social model sites ‘the problem’ within 
society: the affirmative model directly challenges the notion that ‘the problem’ lies 
within the individual or impairment.   
 
The personal tragedy model, although not a fully developed model in its own right, is 
in the background of both the medical and social models. Whether the disability is 
inherent in the person or the society, there is an understanding that the disability 
represents a lack of something, that the disabled person wishes to be without 
whatever is causing their disability. Under the affirmation model, a person's disability 
is every bit a part of their identity as is their eye colour. It is something that simply 

30 
 
makes up who they are, having the potential for both advantages and 
disadvantages. It does not negate that there are difficulties that they face, but rather 
acknowledges that there are also benefits. Or, as Roshni, a blind woman from 
Glasgow, said in an interview, "I've yet to meet anybody who is a hundred percent 
happy with who they are... There's lots of things I'm not happy about. I'm not happy 
about the fact that I've got dry rot in the next room and the ceiling needs replacing. I 
think my visual impairment is on the same scale as that... life happens" (quoted in 
Cameron 2014, 5). 
 
A pertinent critique of both the affirmation model and the wider social model is that 
they are dismissive of the very real negative impacts of a disability. As Grue points 
out in his critique, “if impairments do have negative aspects, however, then in order 
to maintain an overall positive impression, there must be compensations” (Grue 
2015, 207). If someone is blind, then the offshoot (according to cultural mythology) is 
that their hearing is better than non-blind people. There can be no emphasis on their 
lack, only their benefits can be stressed. This often takes shape in the form of 
“supercrip” identity, most often seen in Para-athletic games such as the Paralympics, 
where a disabled person is framed as “superhuman” or even part-machine. This is a 
highly criticised narrative that has strong opposition in disability studies and the wider 
disabled culture (for example, Silva and Howe 2012; Howe 2011), but it has grown 
out of the affirmation model of disability by rejecting any negative impacts of a 
disability. 
 
A newer and rapidly accepted model is the “human rights” model of disability. This 
particular model has grown out of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, which I will discuss in Chapter 2. Briefly, the document outlines the 
inherent rights of disabled people as well as providing tools to protect and promote 
these rights. This model, then, “focuses on the inherent dignity of the human being 
and subsequently, but only if necessary, on the person’s medical characteristics” 
(quoted in Degener 6). In other words, it centralises the person yet still 
acknowledges that they may have difficulties stemming from their disabilities. Their 
disability does not encompass their whole identity but it does affect how they move 
within the world. Degener, one of the authors of the CRPD, notes, “the human rights 
model of disability is more appropriate than the social model to encompass the 

31 
 
experience of impairment, which might not always be bad but certainly can be” (17). 
As mentioned above, this was a common critique of the social model, that by 
situating disability as a social construct, it ignored the physical, daily impacts of 
impairments and did not seek to address those impacts. Again, Degener (12-13) 
states:  
Whereas the social model of disability neglects the fact that disabled persons might 
have to deal with pain, deterioration of quality of life and early death due to 
impairment, and dependency, the human rights model of disability acknowledges 
these life circumstances and demands them to be considered when social justice 
theories are developed. 
 
As will be explained in later chapters, this much more exemplifies my participants’ 
experience of disability, and indeed, is the disability model I use throughout this 
research. I position accessibility as the removal of barriers, in line with both the 
social and human rights models in that it is society that has made a particular 
heritage site inaccessible. However, I also affirm and recognise the very real medical 
issues and physical impairments that my participants with hidden disabilities 
experience. Each of my participants has one or more hidden disabilities, and as will 
be shown throughout this thesis, their experience of being disabled varies from day 
to day, as the physical symptoms of their disabilities are not always consistent. In 
this way, the social model of disability does not help them, as it would consider them 
disabled one day but non-disabled the next. The human rights model, however, does 
“not require a certain health status or a condition of functioning” (7) - referencing 
being able to participate in a potentially disabling society, but for my participants, 
also their identity as a disabled person.  
 
The human rights model is not a full departure from the social model in the same 
way that the social model departs from the medical model, but the human rights 
model does offer the ‘next step’ of the social model. Degener (9) writes: 
Anti-discrimination law can only be seen as a partial solution to the problem. Even in 
a society without barriers and other forms of discrimination, people need social, 
economic and cultural rights. People need shelter, education, employment or cultural 
participation. This is true for all human beings, and thus for disabled persons. 

32 
 
However, because impairment often leads to needs for assistance, it is especially 
true that disabled persons need more than civil and political rights. 
Her inclusion of “cultural participation” is particularly relevant to my research, which 
is about the accessibility of museums and heritage sites, and another reason why I 
have chosen to use the human rights model to understand disability. It is not enough 
to stop discrimination, barriers to participation must actively be dismantled for 
disabled people to be fully included in all aspects of society. 
 
A significant strength of the human rights model of disability is that it moves beyond 
the discussion of disability to a discussion of how to ensure disabled people are full 
participants within society. Lawson and Beckett put it this way: “the nature of the 
human rights model is prescriptive, rather than descriptive, in that it answers the 
question ‘what should we do? ’to advance social justice for disabled people” (365). I 
view my research as more than a theoretical investigation of accessibility; I began 
this research with an aim to change the case study organisations I worked with in 
some positive way. For me, this research has been an act of social justice on behalf 
of my participants - and on behalf of other people with hidden disabilities as well. The 
human rights model of disability gave me the framework within which I could 
understand my participants’ experience of disability, and therefore how these sites 
can remove disabling barriers whilst also acknowledging their very real medical 
symptoms. 
1.2. Hidden Disabilities. 
Throughout this introduction, and indeed, throughout the rest of my research, I have 
referred to hidden disabilities. A “hidden disability” is a disability that is not 
immediately apparent to an outside observer (Disabled World 2021). This can 
include a wide range of disabilities and impairments, from dyslexia to diabetes, and 
can even include some varieties of vision, mobility, or hearing impairments. Further 
discussion of the hidden disabilities relevant to my research is provided in Chapter 5, 
but these disabilities are very often overlooked by most people, even within disability 
studies, as they are not obvious or do not require physical aids as often as more 
visible disabilities. Although they are less noticeable, they are far from rare, with 
nearly half the disabled population having a hidden disability, as seen in Table 1 
below. 

33 
 
￼ 
 
Table 1. Segmentation of disabled population (Table taken from Buhalis and Michopoulou 2011, 153). 
 
Along with its abundance, the societal limitations, as per the social model of 
disability, of a hidden disability are increasingly being recognised. For example, in 
January 2018, the British government proposed changes to their rules for acquiring a 
Blue Badge, a parking sticker that allows people to use a disabled parking space or 
follow a different set of parking regulations, to be more inclusive of hidden disabilities 
(Department for Transport 2018). The change has allowed people with such 
disabilities to have better job opportunities as well as more active social lives thanks 
to less limitations on their mobility.  
 
In the heritage sector specifically, there are small steps being taken to be more 
inclusive towards all disabilities in heritage. The Science Museum Group, which runs 
large national museums around the country including the National Railway Museum 
in York, appointed Direct Access to audit the accessibility of all their sites and 
suggest improvements (Museums + Heritage Advisor 2021b). The Geevor Tin Mine, 
a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Cornwall, created an immersive virtual reality tour 
for disabled visitors who cannot access the physical mine tour (The Geevor Tin Mine 
2021). At Beamish, an outdoor living history museum that recreates daily life from 
different decades of the 19th and 20th century, a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle is 
on standby every day to transport wheelchair visitors around the expansive site 
(Beamish 2021).  
 

34 
 
However, these small steps are still fragmented throughout the country and far from 
common. There is still no larger project that seeks to understand the barriers that 
people with hidden disabilities face at museums. There is still no larger research 
agenda to examine the institutional attitudes that prevent accessibility-related 
change from happening. Training is still being offered only by single-disability groups 
into awareness, accessibility, and adaptation of single disabilities (e.g., Dementia 
Friends or Autism Awareness).  
1.3. Research Design. 
The primary goal of my research is to understand the accessibility needs of people 
with hidden disabilities. As mentioned in section 1 above, I position inaccessibility in 
terms of the social model – it is society that disables a person, or, more specifically, 
creates an inaccessible experience. Therefore, in order to understand their access 
needs, I must examine the barriers they are faced with when visiting museums and 
heritage sites.  
 
In order to understand these barriers, I examine them from the position of a visitor 
with a hidden disability and from the position of the museum or heritage organisation 
which is hosting that visitor. Therefore, my primary research questions are as 
follows: 
1. What are the accessibility needs of people with hidden disabilities in a 
museum context? 
2. What barriers are preventing these needs from being met? 
3. What barriers are preventing change from being enacted? 
 
With the first question, I have aimed to understand the lived experience of a group of 
individuals who have hidden disabilities. Hereafter I refer to these individuals as 
‘participants’ or by their names, as described in Chapter 5. With their embodied 
knowledge, they are the experts of their accessibility needs as dictated by their 
disability. I conduct interviews with these participants who identify as having hidden 
disabilities, specifically interested in the daily impact on their lives. In doing so, I seek 
to better understand the implications of their disabilities, connecting their 

35 
 
experiences with other participants and looking for larger patterns, explored in 
Chapters 7 and 9. 
 
With the second question, I seek to understand the specific barriers that manifest for 
my participants at three case study sites, namely Abbey House Museum in Leeds, 
Barley Hall in York, and Treasurer’s House in York, described in more detail in 
Chapter 5. To this end, I conduct site visits with my participants, encouraging them to 
share their unique experience with me. In analysing the larger patterns present 
across their varied experiences, I find a common theme related to the 
embeddedness of accessibility which prevented them from fully enjoying their visit, 
explored in Chapter 7. 
 
With the third question, I aim to understand the “hidden” barriers that prevent 
changes to accessibility at the organisational level. I theorise that many suggested 
changes to accessibility would not require a great deal of cost or labour, and yet a 
hesitancy and reluctance to enact accessibility measures on the part of many 
heritage organisations is palpable. In order to understand this hesitancy and 
reluctance, I conducted ethnographic observations and interviews with staff at my 
case study sites. Again, in analysing the larger patterns present in my data, I find two 
common themes related to these institutional barriers which suggest that lack of 
communication and lack of knowledge about accessibility needs are responsible for 
these barriers, explored in Chapters 8 and 9. 
 
I focus on three sites in Northern England partially due to their locality and proximity 
to where I was based for my research, but also because York and Leeds both have 
multiple museums, yet little heritage research focuses on these areas. Additionally, 
nearly 1 million people living in the Yorkshire and Humber region have a long-
standing illness or disability that impacts their day-to-day activities, representing 
18.8% of the overall population (Office for National Statistics 2011b), which is slightly 
higher than the national average of 17.6% (Office for National Statistics 2011a). This 
higher percentage, although it does not specify the types of disabilities, means that 
more people in this area have accessibility needs that are likewise not being studied. 

36 
 
1.4. Thesis Structure. 
This thesis is structured in 11 chapters, starting with this introduction, outlining 
models of disability, aiming to explain hidden disabilities, and expounding on my 
research goals for this thesis. It seeks to provide a non-specialist reader with enough 
background knowledge in disability studies and its terminology to understand the rest 
of my research programme. This chapter also positions my research within disability 
studies, explaining my research goals and how I address each of these goals within 
the text.  
 
The second and third chapters position my research within a wider, interdisciplinary 
context. The second chapter reviews the relevant policies and initiatives that affect 
the context in which my research takes place. It explores the impacts of legislation at 
the international, national, and local levels, as well as examining initiatives within 
archaeology and heritage that specifically aim to reach disabled people and bring 
them into the sector. The third chapter reviews the academic literature on 
accessibility in an interdisciplinary context. Literature from heritage studies, tourism 
studies, and disability studies is considered, as is how my research contributes to the 
field of heritage studies.  
 
The fourth chapter explores the current trend of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in the 
heritage sector and how this research fits within that framework. I examine previous 
diversity initiatives and comment upon their efficacy, then discuss how the current 
push for inclusion has a better chance of success than previous attempts. 
 
The fifth chapter describes my methodological process, particularly my use of 
focused ethnography. I also explain the finer points of my data collection, divided 
between my participants with disabilities and my case study sites. I include a 
consideration of the ethics involved in conducting research with disabled people, 
informed by emancipatory research principles. I also discuss my own journey over 
the course of this research from nondisabled researcher to disabled researcher.   
 
The sixth chapter summarises the data that I collected through interviews, 
observations, and site visits with my participants. I introduce my case study sites and 

37 
 
the organisations that run them, including the specific staff members I interviewed as 
part of my research. I then introduce each participant, using their own words to 
describe their experience of being disabled and its impact on their daily lives. 
 
The seventh chapter considers the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
my research. I summarise the events of the pandemic and its impact on my research 
as well as the larger heritage sector. I also consider the impact of the pandemic on 
the disabled population, particularly my participants. I then discuss how each of my 
case study sites adapted their visitor experience and consider how these adaptations 
changed the accessibility of their sites. 
 
The eighth chapter represents the first thematic analysis chapter, exploring the 
theme of Active vs Passive Accessibility. Using narrative vignettes (described in 
more detail in Chapter 6) taken from my site visits with participants and my 
observations at case study sites, I explore the impact of add-on accessibility 
measures and the barriers that they create. I argue that accessibility should be 
embedded into the very design of an exhibition from its outset, creating a more 
inclusive experience for all visitors. 
 
The ninth chapter explores the theme of Lack of Communication at my case study 
sites. Again, I utilise narrative vignettes to explore the difference in communication 
styles, arguing that a lack of communication, particularly between front of house staff 
and management staff, creates a significant hindrance to any change around 
accessibility.  
 
The tenth chapter explores the concept of gaps in disability awareness. I re-examine 
the previous themes through this lens, then consider a specific, significant instance 
that exemplifies the interplay between these three themes. I also explore how gaps 
in disability awareness can be overcome.  
 
The eleventh and final chapter serves as a reflective, reflexive place where I 
consider the implications of my research. I explore potential areas for future 
research, as well as the adaptation that was required for my research due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. I also consider the place of my own research within wider 

38 
 
contexts, as well as the changes that have come about at my case study sites 
because of my research. 
1.5. A Note on Language Use. 
In addition to debates regarding the various models of disability, a great deal of 
publications and articles in disability studies discuss the role of language, particularly 
in regards to how disabled people should be addressed. The “person first” position, 
which addresses this population as “people with disabilities,” emphasises the shared 
humanity of people above all else (e.g., Jensen et al. 2013). The “identity first” 
position, which addresses this population as “disabled people,” counters that their 
experience of disability informs their entire personhood, that it is impossible to 
separate themselves from their disability, and an attempt to do so would be 
tantamount to dismissing their experience as a disabled person (e.g., Gernsbacher 
2017; Sinclair 2013). “Identity first” language is the preferred terminology here in the 
UK, according to the government and informed by multiple disability advocacy 
groups (Disability Unit 2021), and I therefore use it throughout my thesis when 
referring to the disabled population at large.  
 
However, as part of my interviews with participants, I asked them if they considered 
themselves disabled (Appendix C). All but one participant did, and I followed up by 
asking if they preferred the label “disabled person” or “person with a (hidden) 
disability.” Some people had no preference, but amongst those that did, all preferred 
“person with a (hidden) disability.” Out of deference to my participants’ preference, I 
therefore use their preferred terminology when referring to that particular population.

Chapter 2 – Policy Review. 
In this chapter, I review the policy-oriented literature relevant to accessibility in 
heritage. In order to understand what research is currently being conducted and why, 
context about the legal framework this research sits in is necessary. In Europe and 
the UK especially, it has been shown that societal change can happen more quickly 
through legislation (O’Brien 2016, 454; Barnes 2012, 17; Vanhala 2011; Vanhala 
2006; Gooding 1994), and therefore, I offer a brief look into the most impactful 
disability legislation and initiatives, beginning with international efforts.  
2.1. International landscape. 
On an international level, there are three policy-related initiatives that arguably have 
the most significant and widest reaching impacts on the lives of disabled people. As 
discussed below, the WHO’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability, 
and Health (2001), the UN’s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(2007), and the EU’s Accessibility Act (2018) have set the tone for current 
international legislation, as well as disability research worldwide. 
2.1.1. International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health – WHO. 
Far and away, the international report with the greatest impact on subsequent 
legislation and even views of disability itself is the International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability, and Health (shortened to ICF herein), published by the World 
Health Organisation in 2001. At its core, it is a "classification of human functioning 
and disability" (World Health Organization 2001). Not simply a listing of disabilities 
and impairments, the report aims to improve communication between people, 
particularly policy makers, health-care workers, and researchers, by establishing a 
science-based language to describe health and function (5). In creating this common 
language, it allows comparison “across countries, health care disciplines, services, 
and time” (5), arguably paving the way for more robust research and interventions. 
The ICF is not intended to serve as any kind of diagnostic tool or a debate on how to 
view impairments, or, as the WHO calls them, "functions" (3). It is simply a common 
dictionary that everyone, no matter their location, can use to communicate with each 
other about bodily function. 

40 
 
 
Early on in its life, the ICF was referred to as the ICIDH-2, signalling that it was the 
descendent of the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and 
Handicaps, known as the ICIDH. Published in 1980 by the WHO, this was the 
organisation’s first attempt to codify a medical understanding of impairments and 
disabilities. In the WHO’s own words, it “is intended to offer a conceptual framework 
for information; the framework is relevant to the long-term consequences of disease, 
injuries, or disorders, and applicable both to personal health care, including early 
identification and prevention, and to the mitigation of environmental and societal 
barriers” (World Health Organization 1980, 2). From the very beginning, the WHO 
have acknowledged that there is a social aspect to disability, in that there are 
environmental and societal barriers to disabled people’s inclusion, but one of the 
greatest critiques of the ICIDH has been its sole focus on the medical aspect of 
disablement (e.g., Bickenbach 2015; Koutsogeorgou et al. 2014; Bickenbach 2010; 
Üstün et al. 2003). The framework sets up processes to identify and track 
impairments, especially their severity and progression, but there is nothing to identify 
environmental factors. The ICIDH, in my opinion, represents the worst of the medical 
model of disability, where all the focus is on the disabled person and how their body 
is “abnormal.” 
 
In its newer iteration, the ICF has tried to address these critiques. The classification 
of disabilities is divided into 4 categories: body functions, body structures, activities 
and participation, and environmental factors. Half of the categories are centred 
around external factors rather than internal factors, giving researchers the common 
language to discuss these societal barriers. True, these aspects of the ICF have not 
been used to their fullest amongst researchers, as most research still focuses on 
internal factors (Cieza et al. 2019; Kurtaiş et al. 2011; Giannangelo et al. 2005; Dahl 
2002) rather than external factors, but the framework is there, and it is a step in the 
right direction for more internationally collaborative research.  
 
Despite this evolution from the ICIDH, the ICF is still criticised for its emphasis on the 
medical model of disability, although the ICF itself claims to be a combination of the 
social and the medical models – what they dub the "biopsychosocial model" (World 
Health Organization 2011, 20). David Pfeiffer, a disability studies expert who led the 

41 
 
charge for the revision of the ICIDH into the ICF and had input into the wording of the 
new ICF, points out that the ICF still heavily medicalises disability, even when it does 
not need to. As per Pfeiffer, "The medical model which underlies the ICIDH2 
assumes an ontology with an objective, empirical reality. In this so-called reality 
there are numerous dichotomies: sick and healthy; disabled and not-disabled; 
normal and abnormal" (Pfeiffer 2000, 1082). He believes that, within the harsh 
either/or reality that the report creates, there is no room for nuance or subtlety in 
understanding disability, which in turn creates a dangerous precedent that can 
support such evils as eugenics (1082). Although this may seem alarmist, it is a valid 
interpretation, in my opinion, as the medical model can and has been used to 
support the idea of ‘abnormality’ (e.g., Baynton 2011; Areheart 2008; Shakespeare 
1998). Pfeiffer suggests that in order to redress the flaws inherent in the ICF, a 
“philosophical revolution to change the dominant values of worldwide society” (2000, 
1082) is needed. This goal is a lofty one, which perhaps sits outside the purview of a 
document like the ICF. 
 
Additionally, it could be argued the ICF must necessarily treat disability from a 
medical perspective. The authors of the document, the World Health Organisation, 
are far more suited to a medical model of disability, looking at the 'abnormality' of a 
particular individual, as they represent a medical view of the world. The ICF, at least, 
provides a baseline for discussion, a sense of universality that, according to the 
WHO, is able to translate across cultures. In their reply to Pfeiffer, Üstün et al. (2003, 
830) write:  
The move to the universal approach is one of the strengths of the [ICF] and, indeed, 
the reason it can, and should, be employed to monitor the impact of disability rights 
legislation and assess increases in the participation of people with disabilities around 
the world. 
For Üstün et al., the significance of the ICF is how it supports disabled people 
around the world. In the WHO’s own words, the point of the ICF is “to establish a 
common language for describing health and health-related states in order to improve 
communication between different users, such as health care workers, researchers, 
policy-makers and the public, including people with disabilities” (World Health 
Organization 2001, 5). Indeed, before the document was published, it underwent 

42 
 
rigorous “field trials” to ensure “cross-cultural and linguistic applicability of the model 
and classificatory structure and language” (Üstün et al. 2003, 566). 
 
The same cannot be said for the social model of disability. If a person is disabled by 
their society, then this necessarily means that two people with the same level of 
impairments will have different experiences of disability if they exist in different 
societies – indeed, even within one society. Although the social model is preferred 
when looking for solutions to barriers or understandings of the lived experiences of a 
disabled person, the social model makes cross-national comparison impossible. 
Utilising the medical model is perhaps not the method that disability activists would 
prefer, but in order for multiple societies and countries to discuss issues surrounding 
disability and impairment, it is necessary. 
 
There are also some disabilities that are caused by medical conditions which have 
nothing to do with society. Type 1 diabetes, for example, is caused by a 
malfunctioning pancreas, meaning that the body does not produce enough insulin to 
control blood glucose (NHS 2021n). No amount of accommodation from society can 
change the fact that a type 1 diabetic needs regular blood monitoring and injections 
of insulin to merely stay alive. There are social interventions, such as free or 
subsidised health care, that can increase the person’s standard of living and overall 
well-being, but the person will always be dependent on insulin injections to simply 
stay alive. As Üstün et al. write, “it is also a mistake, and a tragic one, to ignore or 
deny the value and appropriateness of medical intervention” (2003, 829). 
 
Regardless of its controversies, the ICF has gone on to help shape other significant 
policies and legislation. For my research, it is vital in understanding the complexity 
that is disablement. It is not a matter of social vs medical--both must be considered. 
There are barriers that museums and heritage sites can dismantle to make their sites 
more accessible to people with hidden disabilities, but there are certain things that 
are beyond their control. A visitor with epilepsy may suddenly have a seizure, 
triggered by something completely unrelated to the museum and therefore the 
museum could not have done anything to prevent it. In cases such as this, the best a 
museum can do is have a policy in place for how to react, and to train staff 
appropriately.  

43 
 
2.1.2. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – UN. 
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(abbreviated to CRPD) was published in 2006. It is a landmark declaration, not only 
to protect and promote the rights of disabled people, but also to outline what these 
rights specifically are. They include equal treatment and opportunity in all aspects of 
life, from education to employment to housing (United Nations 2006, 16-21). By 
explicitly stating and then expanding on these rights, the CRPD gives disability 
advocates, scholars, and organisations the tools to hold State Parties accountable 
(Harpur and Bales 2010, 3).  
 
What sets the CRPD apart from its predecessors is its emphasis on social inclusion 
in various forms, as mentioned above, and the framework set out for monitoring the 
implementation of this policy. This represents a paradigm shift (e.g., Crock et al. 
2017; Bartlett 2014; Harpur 2012; Stein 2011) regarding the inclusion of people with 
disabilities, relying more heavily on the human rights model of disability. As 
mentioned in Chapter 1, it is from this document that the human rights model of 
disability is most fully developed. The CRPD takes the view that society is the 
primary disabling factor and therefore that society must change, with governments 
leading the way. However, it also acknowledges that there are physical implications 
of a person’s impairments which will also impact their every day life..  
 
As with the ICF, there are numerous weaknesses in the CRPD. Of greatest distress 
amongst disability advocates is Article 12, which seems to abolish diminished 
capacity in courts of law due to mental illness (e.g., de Bhailis and Flynn 2017; 
Freeman et al. 2016; Wildeman 2013). The Article itself seeks to establish the 
assumption of equal recognition before the law (United Nations 2006, 10), but many 
advocates worry about the phrasing of the Article and its potential implications. As de 
Bhailis et al. explain (2017, 15), “Article 12 views disability-specific criminal 
provisions including the insanity defence and unfitness to plead as incompatible with 
the guarantee of universal legal provision.” The assumption of equal recognition 
before the law necessarily means that disabled people cannot be discriminated 
against due to their disability – but likewise, they cannot use their disability to explain 
their actions and claim diminished capacity. Additionally, there is no political, 

44 
 
legislative, or financial pressure for States to enforce these measures, aside from the 
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which offers observations on 
States-submitted reports (34-36). Despite these shortcomings, the CRPD offers a 
monumental shift in its provision of a framework for governments to draw up 
legislation and policies to protect the rights of disabled people (Crock et al. 2017; 
Bartlett 2014; Harpur 2012a; Harpur and Bales 2010; Stein 2011). 
 
Importantly for my research, Article 30 states that (United Nations 2006): 
States Parties recognise the right of persons with disabilities to take part on an equal 
basis with others in cultural life, and shall take all appropriate measures to ensure 
that persons with disabilities... enjoy access to places for cultural performances or 
services, such as theatres, museums, cinemas, libraries and tourism services, and, 
as far as possible, enjoy access to monuments and sites of national cultural 
importance. 
 
Culture is one of many areas of social life that the CRPD covers, but it is significant 
that museums are specifically included in this convention. Too often, cultural heritage 
and disability are discussed in different political spheres with little overlap between 
them. By including heritage in this convention, it highlights the importance of heritage 
as a means of social inclusion for disabled people, and provides further impetus for 
museums and heritage sites to take their access provisions seriously. 
2.1.3. European Accessibility Act – EU. 
In November 2018, the European Union passed the European Accessibility Act 
(abbreviated EAA), which aims to standardise levels of accessibility on certain 
products throughout the EU. In its opening memorandum, the EAA explicitly states 
that it is the CRPD that brought this particular EAA into being to help EU member 
states enact the requirements of the CRPD (The European Commission 2015, 2). 
The EAA sets out basic levels of accessibility for many consumer products and 
services, including ATMs, smart phones, ticketing machines, and e-readers. This 
marks a significant step forward in removing international barriers for disabled 
people, as there is more harmony and consistency between countries for travellers, 
but also because it ensures less unintentional discrimination. For example, by 
making self-service ticketing machines more accessible, this means that more 

45 
 
disabled people will be able to use them, and therefore need to use ticketing 
counters less (Petrie and Darzentas 2018; Petrie et al. 2014). This may seem a 
small matter, but ticketing counters often involve queueing and face-to-face 
interaction, both of which require more time and effort on the part of the disabled 
traveller. Additionally, forcing this face-to-face interaction leaves them vulnerable to 
negative attitudes towards disabled people, an attitude which is startlingly common 
(see Chapter 3), and thus creates more strife, anxiety, and feelings of exclusion. 
Simply by ensuring that disabled people can use a ticketing machine like 
nondisabled people, all of these negatives can be avoided and the disabled person 
can have the same experience as any other member of society.  
 
Naturally, the EAA has shortcomings. The European Disability Forum released a 
statement shortly after the provisional text was released expressing their 
disappointment and frustration (European Disability Forum 2018). Their main 
disappointment concerned what the EAA does not cover – namely, transportation 
services and infrastructure, buildings, household appliances, and microenterprises 
which, under the EAA, would be exempt as the Act would cause a “disproportionate 
burden” on their manufacturers (The European Commission 2015, 5). These are 
very understandable disappointments as they represent rather large holes in the 
legislative framework. Continuing the example from above, an accessible ticketing 
machine provides no guarantee that the service itself, be it train, plane, boat, or even 
event venue, is accessible for the ticket holder. Likewise, the exemption of 
microenterprises is worrying, as the EAA itself recognises that “most jobs in the 
Union are provided by SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] and 
microenterprises” (European Commission 2015, 4). If they constitute so large an 
employer and, presumably, so large a service provider, how can they remain exempt 
from these accessibility standards? Does their exemption not undermine the 
ambition of providing standards across the Union? 
 
Thus far, it is difficult to determine the impact of the EAA on increasing inclusion for 
disabled people, as there are still future milestones for the legislation. The Act must 
be adopted into national legislation by the Member States by 28 June 2022, and the 
measures themselves must be applied from 28 June 2025 (Drabarz 2020, 87). 
Nevertheless, it represents one of the most ambitious pieces of multi-national 

46 
 
legislation to address accessibility, and it will be interesting to see how it is 
implemented in the future. 
2.2. National landscape. 
Beyond the international level, which aims at providing overall goals and standards, 
national policies and initiatives also impact on the day to day existence of disabled 
people. National legislation complements international regulations by adapting the 
international goals into actions that are most appropriate for the country. The CRPD, 
for example, sets out a framework for countries to create their own legislation, 
allowing for cultural nuances and tensions to be accommodated. Below I examine 
some of the more significant legislation and government programmes in the UK for 
disabled people, especially relating to museums and heritage. First is the Equality 
Act, arguably the most far-reaching policy, then I look at various British government 
initiatives, and finally the UK’s Taking Part survey, which looks at the involvement of 
various minority groups in cultural programmes. I focus here only on the UK because 
it is the home of my three case study sites.  
2.2.1. Equality Act. 
Passed in 2010, the Equality Act codified a selection of “protected characteristics,” 
including sexual orientation, race, and disability, and outlined prohibited conduct as 
well as non-discrimination actions that everyone in the UK (except Northern Ireland) 
is required to observe under the law. It was meant as a way to unify a variety of anti-
discrimination laws, such as the Equal Pay Act (1970), the Race Relations Act 
(1976) and the Disability Discrimination Act (1995). In general, it protects people with 
these protected characteristics from discrimination, harassment, and victimisation.  
 
In terms of non-discrimination, the Act covers a variety of areas including 
employment opportunities and treatment, access to education and housing, and 
engagement in political parties and other associations. Although it is only one of the 
nine protected characteristics, disability has its own special considerations. The 
concept of “reasonable adjustment” features heavily in these considerations, 
meaning that unlike the other protected characteristics, people with disabilities do not 
necessarily have a promise of strictly equal treatment. As has been shown across 
disability studies literature (e.g., Washington 2018; Fredman 2013; Sunstein 2007; 

47 
 
Light 2001), reasonable adjustment can be both a positive and a negative thing. On 
one hand, this “reasonable adjustment” acknowledges that barriers currently exist, 
such as stairs or text-heavy signs, and that some people are disabled by these 
barriers. The reasonable adjustments of ramps, lifts, and alternate accessible 
reading formats allow for people with various disabilities to access the same services 
and opportunities as nondisabled people. On the other hand, the phrase “reasonable 
adjustment” is incredibly vague and open to interpretation, leading many 
organisations to adopt a “good enough” attitude rather than adopting meaningful 
change within the structure of their organisation (Ineson and Morris 2006; Goodall et 
al. 2004). For example, Goodall et al. raise concerns that listed buildings will assume 
a separate entrance for disabled people is adequate instead of trying to make the 
main entrance accessible (355). Their concern, as it turns out, is valid, as in their 
accessibility audit of Speke Hall in Liverpool, Andani et al. (2013) describe this exact 
example. The main entrance to the Hall is inaccessible to many disabled visitors 
because it has a cobbled surface, stairs, and no handrail (24). Although there are 
alternate accessible entrances, “there are historic features on the main entrance 
which are unable to be fully appreciated by disabled visitors” (24). The “good 
enough” of alternative, accessible entrances means that disabled visitors to Speke 
Hall are denied the opportunity to experience and explore these historic features that 
nondisabled visitors can enjoy. 
 
Nothing in the Act specifically mentions museums or heritage, although the 
“reasonable adjustment” provision obviously impacts these sites. This is perhaps not 
surprising, as the Act is meant to cover as wide a variety of services and 
organisations as possible, as well as a wide array of protected characteristics, and 
therefore it may be unreasonable to expect a direct statement on the inclusion of 
disabled people in heritage. As seen in Andani et al. (2013) as well as other research 
(e.g., May Lauder 2020; Coughlan and Lister 2018; Read et al. 2018), the Act has 
had an impact on accessibility across a number of sectors, including museums and 
heritage, giving disabled people a legal justification in “reasonable adjustment” to 
insist on equitable treatment and access.  

48 
 
2.2.2. Government Initiatives. 
In an effort to provide resources for organisations to follow the provisions of the 
Equality Act, the UK government has put forth a variety of tools and schemes. One 
of the most significant schemes is Disability Confident Employers. As will be 
examined later in Chapter 3, many people have a negative view of disabled people, 
especially when it comes to employment. These attitudes are not necessarily born 
out of hatred, but rather tend to be fuelled by inexperience and ignorance. It has 
been shown that interaction with disabled people as well as training can change 
mindsets (e.g., Schitko and Simpson 2012; Bizjak et al. 2011; Daruwalla and Darcy 
2005): these are the driving forces behind the Disability Confident scheme.  
 
The scheme provides guidance to employers on how to attract, recruit, and retain 
disabled employees. Each Disability Confident resource developed for employers 
begins with an overview of why employing disabled people can benefit an 
organisation, working to break the negative idea that these employees would be a 
drain on resources (Beyer and Robinson 2009; Louvet et al. 2009). The scheme’s 
documents include not only guidance for how to sign up to the scheme and progress 
through the various tiers of confidence, but also case studies highlighting the 
successes of the scheme and a listing of all the employers that have signed up to the 
scheme. Like the Equality Act, this scheme encompasses all disabled people, 
including those with hidden disabilities. In its guidance for employers, long-term 
health conditions and mental health conditions are specifically mentioned and 
clarified to count as disabilities within the context of the scheme (DWP 2018, 12-13), 
a welcome change from most previous disability schemes. 
 
Beyond employment, the UK government has also published a strategy policy to 
guide the tourism sector in Britain through the next decade. One of the expressed 
goals is “to make the UK the most accessible destination in Europe by 2025” (HM 
Government 2019, 39). Interestingly, there is acknowledgement in the document that 
the industry has already made great strides in increasing its accessibility offers and 
that it is promotion and marketing that are now lacking, something that falls on the 
shoulders of the British Tourist Authority, part of the Department for Culture, Media, 
and Sport. Following this acknowledgement, the document identifies several steps 

49 
 
that the British Tourist Authority will take to remedy this oversight. These steps 
include incorporating accessibility into ongoing campaigns by highlighting 
accessibility offers, but also by including people with visible disabilities in their 
promotional material (40). Two of their three case studies specifically cite 
accessibility offers for people with hidden disabilities: Titanic Belfast discusses their 
partnership with AutismNI and their autism-friendly offers, like quiet spaces and ear 
defenders (41), and Wadworth Pubs cover their efforts in working to train their 
employees to be Dementia Friends – people who are specially trained in living with 
dementia and helping people with dementia (42). Unfortunately, like many other 
industries, COVID-19 has side-lined many of these plans, and currently, it is unlikely 
that the government will achieve their targets, as outlined in this strategy, by 2025.  
2.2.3. Taking Part Survey. 
Launched in 2005 by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS), in 
partnership with Arts Council England, Historic England, and Sport England, the 
Taking Part survey monitors the engagement of adults aged 16 years and older as 
well as children aged 5-15 in a variety of “cultural, digital, and sporting” (HM 
Government 2021) areas. Although it only covers households in England, it provides 
statistics that allow for long-term analysis. Most significantly for this research, it 
monitors not just general population engagement with culture, digital and sport, but 
also the engagement levels of various minority groups, including adults with a long-
standing illness or disability. 
 
The most recent survey was published in September 2019 (although another was 
scheduled for publication in Autumn 2021 and delayed due to COVID-19), and 
features data on both heritage sites, and museums and galleries. Heritage sites, 
according to the survey, are categorised as “a city or town with historic character, a 
monument such as a castle, fort or ruin, and a historic park, garden or landscape 
open to the public” (Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport 2019, 7). There is 
no stated definition of “museum” or “gallery,” but I understand it to be a specific 
building containing culture, such as historic objects or art pieces. The survey found 
that 69.9% of adults with a disability visited a heritage site during the period from 
April 2018 to March 2019 (16), while only 45.3% of adults with a disability visited a 
museum or gallery in that same period (13). These levels are lower than the general 

50 
 
population, which was 73.6% for heritage sites and 52.3% for museums and 
galleries. Across the board, all of these numbers have increased since the previous 
survey for 2017/2018, showing that more people in general are engaging with these 
places, a positive trend for the heritage and museum sector. 
 
Although the survey itself provides no further synthesis, it does serve as the basis for 
a wide range of research. Everything from the participation of older people in the arts 
(e.g., Keaney and Oskala 2007) to the link between cultural exposure and social 
mobility (e.g., Scherger and Savage 2010) to regional disparities (e.g., Leguina and 
Miles 2017) has been explored using Taking Part survey data. Importantly for my 
research, Fancourt and Baxter 2020 explored the relationship between mental health 
and participation in community cultural activities (2020). Their analysis found that 
people experiencing low levels of happiness, as they would if they had depression, 
were less likely to participate in activities like visiting the cinema, attending an opera, 
or seeing an exhibition or art display (3). 
2.3. Local landscape – Yorkshire. 
As important as these nationwide disability-related initiatives are, it is on the local 
level that practical steps to address inequality and inaccessibility are often taken. 
Local councils manage social care benefits, such as blue badge applications and 
disability allowances, and therefore are most likely to interact directly with disabled 
people. Because of the importance of local council involvement, I now turn to 
examine the attitudes and policies of the cities that house my case study sites: York 
and Leeds. 
2.3.1. York. 
York is a city that is well known for its heritage and museums, consistently ranked as 
one of the best tourist destinations in the UK (Collier 2021; Dearskey 2021; Touropia 
2021), especially for cultural heritage (Carr-Allinson 2021; Love Exploring 2020; 
Barratt 2018). The city welcomed 8.4 million visitors in 2018 (Make It York 2019), 
meaning that potentially over 1.7 million disabled visitors came to York in that year3. 
Most only come for day trips (Make It York 2019), but for residents of the city, 
                                            
3 Based 20% of the UK population, per Scope 2021. 

51 
 
particularly disabled residents, living in York can be a challenge whether in or out of 
tourist season.  
 
One of the major draws of York is its ambiance (Mordue 2007, 2005), thanks to its 
abundance of historical buildings within the city. However, it is this ambiance that 
often makes the city itself inaccessible to disabled residents (Yodan 2019). The 
Shambles, one of the most famous streets in York, is narrow, often crowded, and full 
of cobblestones and uneven pavement slabs. These aspects make for a charming 
photo opportunity, but they also make it impossible for a wheelchair user to traverse 
the street. Recognising this problem, the city itself has made improvements to be 
more accessible. The city centre, home to the vast majority of York’s museums and 
heritage sites, has restricted vehicle access, making it easier for pedestrians (be 
they ambulatory, using mobility aids, or using wheelchairs or scooters) to get around. 
Blue Badge holders are exempt from these restrictions in order to drop off 
passengers closer to their destinations. Additionally, Blue Badge holders can park for 
free in the Council's car parks and on-street parking bays (City of York Council 
2021).   
 
However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Council came under fire for ignoring 
the needs of its disabled residents. In a bid to encourage and allow for social 
distancing, many more streets throughout the city centre were made pedestrian-only 
and Blue Badge parking spaces were removed (Johnson 2021). At the time, the 
Council said that the measures were temporary, even as disability activists in the city 
raised concern that they could not access the city centre with these restrictions in 
place. Indeed, these concerns came to fruition in the summer of 2021, when the 
Council proposed that these changes be made permanent. Again, disability activists 
were upset, but also not surprised. The lack of consultation with disabled people 
about these measures is something that disability activists have decried for a long 
time (York Disability Rights Forum 2021) and unfortunately, it seems as if York used 
the pandemic to accelerate previous plans that may have a drastic, negative impact 
on York’s disabled residents. As Helen Jones of the York Disability Forum said, 
“when the pandemic hit, it felt like the council took advantage” (Johnson 2021). 

52 
 
2.3.2. Leeds. 
Leeds, with its own storied history and heritage, does not have the same heritage 
tourism industry that York does. Although it attracts far more visitors – 30.42 million 
in 2019 (Visit Leeds 2020) – the largest industry in Leeds is its finance and business 
industry (Leeds City Council 2021b), suggesting that a significant portion of these 
visitors are work-related trips. Additionally, Leeds plays host to a number of 
significant sporting events each year (Visit Leeds 2021c) as well as a thriving theatre 
district (Visit Leeds 2021b) and numerous concert venues (Visit Leeds 2021a), which 
also add to these visitor statistics. Museums and heritage, then, are less visible on 
visitors’ agendas. Indeed, only 1.7 million visitors in 2018 attended the nine 
museums run by Leeds City Council (Beecham 2019), a record number for Leeds 
yet only 5% of the total number of visitors to the city.  
 
However, even if Leeds is not the cultural heritage destination that York is, the city 
still has a strong focus on improving the lives of its citizens, especially their disabled 
citizens. They have a specific equality and diversity section of their website (Leeds 
City Council 2021a), as well as an Equality Improvement Policy, and both the 
website and the Policy specifically mention disabled people. Additionally, they have 
published a Supplementary Planning Document called Accessible Leeds, which 
outlines the expectation of accessibility in planning applications within Leeds (Leeds 
City Council 2016). The document espouses a “pan-disability” attitude (4), meaning 
that they specifically mention hidden disabilities alongside other disabilities when 
discussing disabled people. The document also dedicates a section to Leeds historic 
environment, explaining that even listed buildings can and should be made 
accessible following the “constructive conservation” model (21-24), something I 
discuss in Chapter 3. They even use Leeds City Museum as a case study for 
effective adaptation of a listed building for increased accessibility without diminishing 
its historic importance or listed characterisation (23-24). 
 
That is not to imply that Leeds is a perfectly accessible city, especially given its 
recent controversy over proposals to change a taxi rank location outside Leeds 
Railway Station to an area dubbed the “Dark Arches” that is seen as less safe 
(Norden 2021). But by enshrining the need for accessibility into their planning 

53 
 
process as well as highlighting equality and diversity as a priority on their website, 
they have shown their commitment to disabled citizens across Leeds. 
2.4. Charity and tertiary sector. 
In order to change societal attitudes, pressure must be applied from multiple angles. 
The government may be seen as one angle, but equally important is the work of 
various charities and non-government organisations. Groups such as the Union of 
the Physically Impaired Against Segregation have a long history of fighting for social 
change, both politically and within society itself (e.g., Baldwinson 2019). As will be 
shown below, the collective power of these groups has driven legislative change, 
and although the charities often amplify the voice of a specific disabled group, these 
changes can have an impact on a variety of other groups. Additionally, these groups 
have worked to incorporate disabled people in the practice of archaeology itself, 
changing attitudes and opening doors that might otherwise have remained closed.  
 
As mentioned above, pressure from the political organisation of these charities and 
organisations has changed government policy. For example, because of a concerted 
effort by the National Autism Society, the criteria for Blue Badge eligibility have 
changed (National Autistic Society 2019; Department for Transport 2018). Blue 
Badge holders are able to park in specially allocated parking spaces, often nearest 
entrances, and also follow different on-street parking rules – for example, they can 
park on double yellow lines, which is normally prohibited. Before the proposed 
changes, there was a clear emphasis on physical disabilities, especially for 
wheelchair users, and people with other disabilities, such as autism or dementia, 
were excluded from the scheme. Under the new regulations, people who would 
encounter “very considerable difficulty whilst walking” from a vehicle to their 
destination would be eligible for a Blue Badge (Department for Transport 2018). This 
is a more inclusive requirement, as autistic people, people with dementia, and 
people with chronic pain would all experience different types of “difficulty” whilst 
travelling to their destination. By using their political sway, the NAS has made it far 
easier for many disabled people, including but not only autistic people, to get the 
support they need. 
 

54 
 
It is not just policy change that these charity and tertiary sector groups work for. Of 
relevance to my research, there are some organisations that actively work to 
introduce disabled people to heritage and archaeology. Perhaps most famously, 
Operation Nightingale provides wounded, injured, and sick military personnel 
opportunities to be involved in archaeological excavations (Wessex Archaeology 
2021). During these excavations, service personnel are able to develop additional 
skills they can then use after they are discharged, as well as providing a safe place 
for them to work through the emotional and psychological difficulties that come with 
integration back into civilian life (Finnegan 2016, 17). There is ample evidence that 
these excavations have a hugely positive effect on the service people who take part 
in them, (e.g., Everill et al. 2020; Farrell-Banks 2018; Rush 2012), and at least one 
participant has gone on to become a professional archaeologist (Winterton 2014), 
proving how important programmes such as Operation Nightingale are in bring 
disabled people to archaeology.  
 
Another organisation that is working to encourage disabled people into archaeology 
is the Enabled Archaeology Foundation (EAF). Begun in 2017 by the late Theresa 
O’Mahony, the goal of the EAF is to empower disabled people (not just military 
personnel, like Operation Nightingale) who want to enter field archaeology. Her 
passion comes from her own experiences as an undergraduate, applying to 38 field 
schools and subsequently being rejected by 36 of them based on her disability, as 
well as her own experience of discrimination within the sector (O’Mahony 2018, 216). 
As such, her work focused on accessibility for disabled field archaeologists, showing 
that simple, cost-effective measures can be taken to include wheelchair users, blind 
archaeologists, and even archaeologists with hidden disabilities such as dyslexia 
(O’Mahony 2015). However, as with many initiatives within the disability sphere, 
although hidden disabilities were included, they were a small segment of the 
research and even then, represented an even smaller section of people with hidden 
disabilities – in this case, people with dyslexia.  
 
In September 2021, a new pilot programme was launched by York Archaeological 
Trust called Archaeology on Prescription (York Archaeology 2021). The first 9-week 
pilot brought field archaeologists and participants together to excavate a former care 
home within York’s city walls. Participants are recommended to the project as part of 

55 
 
a social prescription initiative from partner organisations, including Converge, which 
works with adults who use mental health services (Converge 2021). Participants 
then take part in the excavation alongside field archaeologists, learning new skills 
and building confidence (York Archaeology 2021) as well as offering a new social 
network for participants. A particular aspect that sets this project apart is its focus on 
hidden disabilities. Although specific disabilities were not disclosed, all Converge 
participants have some kind of mental health condition, widely recognised as a 
hidden disability (Drake et al. 2012; Goodley 2001; Mulvany 2000). The fact that 
Archaeology on Prescription focuses on participants specifically with hidden 
disabilities is encouraging, and although the sustainability and impact of the project 
remains to be seen, it is a much-needed step towards the wider inclusion of disabled 
people in archaeology. 
 
As my PhD came towards its end, another a new programme called Curating for 
Change was announced, which aims to provide “18-month fellowships to eight 
disabled people – and 40-day traineeships to another eight disabled people” within 
the museum sector (Pring 2021b). These eight fellows will look through collections 
and archives to “improve the way disability history is represented in museums,” and 
the programme also aims to break down barriers that disabled people face when 
trying to enter the museum sector. Importantly to my research, the creators of the 
programmes consulted a variety of disabled people, including neurodivergent4 
people. Again, the inclusion of people with hidden disabilities in designing a 
fellowship such as Curating for Change is a welcome turn towards more inclusive 
action in the museum sector. 
2.5. Summary. 
In examining the legislative framework, government initiatives, and tertiary sector 
programmes and projects related to disability and accessibility, the context of 
disability research is more understandable. Progressive social legislation is informed 
by research, but likewise, research occurs in response to legislation, seeking to 
understand its impact and ramifications. In the next chapter, I examine the academic 
                                            
4  “Neurodivergent” is the preferred term for people who have impairments that have traditionally been 
classified as learning disabilities, behavioural issues, or mental illnesses (such as autism, dyslexia, 
OCD, etc.), as it is now understood that their brains work differently than “neurotypical” brains.

research relevant to my research – research that has been informed by the policy 
frameworks I have just discussed. 
 
 
 

57 
 
Chapter 3 – Literature Review. 
Having explored the legislative and policy groundwork relevant to accessibility on the 
international, national, local, and charity levels, I now turn to the academic research 
regarding accessibility. Some studies have been conducted on the topic of 
accessibility by researchers and professionals in the heritage industry, but much of it 
is fragmented and site-specific, making it difficult to apply to other museums and 
heritage sites. Due to this fragmentation, a wider frame of reference is necessary, 
exploring research across the tourism industry in an effort to form a more 
comprehensive understanding of current and past accessibility work in the cultural 
sector. Few studies have focused on hidden disabilities, making it necessary to 
review research that encompasses a variety of disabilities. In reading through the 
literature, three particular categories of scholarship become apparent. These include, 
(i) studies into the current status of accessibility, (ii) explorations of proposals to 
increase accessibility, and (iii) current and potential barriers to increased 
accessibility for disabled people. In this chapter, I consider each of these research 
strands and their relevance to my investigations. 
3.1. Current State of Accessibility. 
The access needs of disabled people are incredibly wide and varied, which is why 
research into this field will never be fully complete. Disabled people are not a 
homogeneous group (Blichfeldt and Nicolaisen 2011, 81), and even within a 
particular disability, there are a wide variety of needs (Figueiredo, Eusébio and 
Kastenholz 2012, 545) and levels of disablement (Buhalis and Michopoulou 2011, 
157). There will always be room for improvement, and as the world's population 
ages, there will also be more need for accessibility services (McKercher and Darcy 
2018; Pagán 2015; Buhalis and Michopoulou 2011; Darcy and Dickson 2009). 
 
A basic starting point for research into accessibility is to audit current offers at 
museums and heritage sites. Many studies are simply this: reviews of what different 
sites in different places are doing or reflections on the state of affairs cross-
institutionally. In Britain, such audit-oriented work is a particularly forceful branch of 
research that is often led by disability organisations. Euan's Guide, a website that 

58 
 
allows users to comment on public spaces' accessibility, and VocalEyes, a charity to 
support people who are blind or partially sighted, both run regular surveys into 
current accessibility at public venues. Euan's Guide produces a yearly survey 
regarding the importance of accessibility, answered by their website's users(Euan’s 
Guide 2019; 2018; 2017). These surveys show that accessibility in most places is 
still deficient, and that a large percentage of people with disabilities avoid places 
altogether because of uncertainty about accessibility options (Euan’s Guide 2017, 4; 
2018, 11). VocalEyes publishes a bi-annual "State of Museum Access" survey that, 
initially, examined the presence of accessibility information on museum websites. 
Although it does not then verify the accuracy of any information on the websites 
themselves, it does show how little information there is on most museum websites 
(Cock 2016, 7). In their 2020 survey, they shifted their focus to the experience of 
disabled people who use these access services (Cock et al. 2020, 2). This survey 
found that disabled people wanted more access information available online, more 
accessible events, and better staff awareness (5). Combined with the results of the 
Euan's Guide surveys that show disabled people avoid sites that do not contain 
accessibility information, it is little wonder that disabled people are reluctant to visit 
museums. 
 
Whilst these surveys are useful to see long-term change and are also critical in 
amplifying the voices of disabled people, they are not without their drawbacks. For 
instance, there is a notable lack of diversity amongst the disabled people surveyed. 
VocalEyes is a charity that works with and on behalf of blind and partially-sighted 
people, and as such, their research focuses primarily on this demographic of the 
disabled community. Euan’s Guide, which was founded by a wheelchair user, has 
had a focus on physical accessibility, especially for wheelchair users, in previous 
surveys. In the latest versions of each survey, however, there have been comments 
from respondents regarding the increase of awareness of hidden disabilities, 
suggesting that the demographics for these surveys are widening. Indeed, in the 
2020 VocalEyes survey, they partnered with Autism in Museums, an initiative to 
raise awareness of accessibility in museums, particularly for autistic visitors. Such a 
partnership led to noticeable changes in the survey questions themselves, as they 
were more inclusive of the experiences of other disabled people. Hopefully the trend 

59 
 
will continue, bringing more disabled voices into these surveys and providing more 
well-rounded and inclusive results.  
 
Complementing such surveys and audits are comparable scholarly analyses, which 
tend to be more narrowly focused. For example, Mesquita and Carneiro (2016, 380) 
analysed the accessibility of 28 museums in four cities across Europe (London, 
Paris, Lisbon, and Madrid) to determine how accessible they were to visitors with 
visual impairments. They developed what they call a grid system, a set of specific, 
established accessibility measures (such font size on signs, tactile activities, and 
staff training), to facilitate their analysis (381-2). They found that there are wide 
discrepancies in implementation of these accessibility measures across the sites 
(385). Even at a specific museum, the building itself may rank highly on its 
accessibility but the exhibitions, both in design and interpretation, could rank very 
low (385). In practice, this means it may be easy to get into a museum, but difficult to 
understand or even experience the exhibitions. For example, 95% of museums did 
not have glass front doors, which are difficult for people with visual difficulties to see 
(382), but less than 20% of museums offered either tactile ground indicators or relief 
maps of the museum, both which help people with visual difficulties find their way 
around (383). It may be easier for these visitors to come in the front door, but little 
attention has been paid to helping them move around the museum itself. The 
suggestions Mesquita and Carneiro make to address such discrepancies are low 
cost and require minimal effort, such as offering hand-held magnifiers to help people 
better see signs and artefacts, showing that increasing accessibility need not mean 
dramatically increasing an exhibition's budget (384). However, their survey only 
examined accessibility measures that aid people with visual difficulties, which 
represents a small percentage (4.1% as per Buhalis and Michopoulou (2011)) of 
disabled people in the study areas that they focused upon.  
 
In her 2015 research, Lapszynski reviews the digital technologies at three different 
American museums (The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of 
Science in Boston, and Philadelphia’s Magic Gardens) and how they may be used 
by disabled patrons. She found that all three sites have not fully realised the potential 
of these technologies. For example, she critiques the Met’s use of audio guides, 
which are generally seen as an accessibility aid and yet do not have any primary 

60 
 
focus for disabled people who may use it as such (30). Most audio guides assume 
that a user can see a particular object or installation, as there is little to no 
descriptive narration of it. How can this be an accessibility aid if it still assumes a 
user has no sensory impairments, particularly visual impairments? Without this 
descriptive narration, someone who is unable to see the object, either because of 
visual impairments or height differences or a number of other reasons, still is 
excluded from the experience.  
 
For their online offerings as well, the three museums are generally disappointing. 
Philadelphia’s Magic Gardens primarily uses social media to curate their presence, 
something that Lapszynski praises as a means of strengthening bonds between the 
museum and its patrons and also providing room for a user to create their own 
unique narrative (2015, 45). However, this interaction does not necessarily focus on 
disabled people, and as McMillen and Alter point out, social media does little to 
include disabled people – unless they are specifically targeted – and can even 
actively exclude people with certain disabilities (2017, 7). The Met and the Museum 
of Science both offer a wide range of online materials, especially videos, podcasts, 
and mobile apps (Lapszynski 2015, 31-32 and 38-39) but they tend to exclude 
disabled people. The Museum of Science’s online videos rely on a user being able to 
both see and hear what is being conveyed, something that automatically excludes 
people with visual or hearing difficulties (39). Likewise, the Met’s online videos have 
no captioning nor do they provide audio description of any of the artworks which they 
are explaining (31). These are profound barriers that keep disabled people from 
being able to participate and learn from their websites. 
 
Primarily, Lapszynski focuses on accessibility for visitors with mobility, visual, or 
hearing difficulties (2015, 29-30; 38-39; 43-44), although attention is also given to 
tactile exhibitions and aids which are helpful to not only these populations, but also 
people with sensory difficulties and neurodiverse people (38; 44). That being said, it 
is disappointing to read that Philadelphia’s Magic Gardens, which already has 
significant physical access problems with no lift, escalators, and limited ramps (43), 
has begun the process of scaling back their tactile aspects in the name of conserving 
the fabric of the garden (44). This is not to say that accessibility should necessarily 
trump conservation, but there is no indication that any alternative will be put into 

61 
 
place to fill the gap that will be left behind when they take away these hands-on 
experiences. Overall, Lapszynski’s research highlights how easy it is for museums to 
overlook disabled people in their adoption of digital technologies and thereby create 
one more inaccessible area of their museum, something that is corroborated by 
McMillen and Alter (2017), mentioned above, and Chancey Fleet’s research into 
accessible technology (Access: Special Interest Group on Accessible Computing 
2020; Fleet 2019). Fleet, a blind researcher, focuses on unintentionally exclusive 
coding within social media, something she dubs “encoded inhospitality” (Fleet 2019). 
According to Fleet, although technically accessibility options are present in social 
media, such as the option to include alt text on photos for screen readers, they are 
often buried within settings, putting an inordinate burden on the user to make their 
content accessible (Access: Special Interest Group on Accessible Computing 2020; 
Fleet, Choi and Guzman 2020). 
 
Sometimes accessibility audits, such as Lapszynski’s (2015), do not examine a site’s 
entire offerings, but rather focus on a particular aspect of it. This is the case in 
Martins’ research (2016), where she examines a sign-language tour given at 
Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, Portugal. The tour itself was organised by 
the Deaf Portuguese Association, who co-wrote the tour along with the museum’s 
education officer, and not only discussed various objects in the museum, but also the 
role of d/Deaf people in cultures and time periods that were related to these objects 
(204-5). The crucial aspect of the tour was that it was delivered in sign language, the 
primary language for most of the visitors on the tour. According to Martins, this 
created a far more welcoming atmosphere than simply providing written transcripts, 
as most people who use sign language use it as their primary language, with the 
written word being a secondary language – in this case, Portuguese (203). 
Therefore, it is actually more difficult for them to understand the written language, 
which can bar them from fully engaging with the information that is being presented 
and makes the experience less accessible to the very people it is intended to help. 
This case study shows the importance of flexible thinking in accessibility, and that 
working with disability organisations can open doors to more creative and more 
inclusive efforts. Perhaps a sign language-led tour may not be optimal for every 
visitor who walks through the door, but as museums are increasingly offering 
information in other languages (e.g., Garibay and Yalowitz 2015; Huerta and Migus 

62 
 
2015; Martin and Jennings 2015; Marlow and Clough 2007), sign language should 
not be overlooked as an option for translation. 
 
There are exceptions to this single disability focus, of course, one being a 2007 
project based at the University of York on the accessibility of Canons Ashby, an 
Elizabethan Manor House in Northamptonshire (Bennet 2007). In her thorough 
examination of Canons Ashby, Bennet highlights various accessibility issues present 
at the site (2007, 21-34), although they do not limit themselves to one particular type 
of disability when examining these issues. Perhaps predictably, physical access is 
primarily discussed, particularly how a wheelchair user is prohibited from visiting a 
large portion of the site due the site's historic nature and lack of lifts (21-23). 
However, physical barriers as they apply to people with visual difficulties are also 
discussed, such as ill-placed chairs that partially obstruct doorways, uneven 
surfaces, and loose carpet edges, all of which present obstacles to visitors who may 
not be able to see these hazards (28-29). Likewise, Bennet also mentions how the 
audio guide, despite often being touted as a widely-available accessibility tool, is not 
particularly useful for visitors with visual difficulties, as it still assumes a level of 
visual ability (31). There is also an over-reliance on verbally-transmitted 
interpretation in the form of room stewards, which puts visitors with hearing 
difficulties at a disadvantage (31). As the author points out, no staff or volunteers at 
the site are trained in British Sign Language; likewise, not all hearing-impaired 
people can read lips, nor are the staff or volunteers trained in how to speak for lip-
reading (31). By focusing on more than one disability, Bennet is able to examine and 
critique accessibility for a far wider population than most other academic surveys. 
Since the publishing of this thesis, it is unclear if any changes have taken place at 
Canons Ashby; however, their accessibility guide has greatly improved to include 
possible barriers such as surface types, number of stairs, and areas that are only 
accessible via stairs (National Trust 2021a). 
 
While these multi-disability surveys seem to be the exception rather than the rule in 
heritage research, the same cannot be said for the wider tourism field. There are still 
single disability surveys, such as Power and Jürgensen’s 2010 study of information 
presentation for people with visual difficulties, which outlines specific examples of 
accessibly-produced materials, such as audio guides (98), embossed paper (99), 

63 
 
and screen reader-compatible documents (101). There are far more examples of 
research that involves a wider array of disabilities or that affect a larger portion of the 
disabled population. Burns et al.’s 2009 study of disabled people’s outdoor leisure 
experiences indicates that whilst most outdoor leisure providers believe that disabled 
people like to visit the outdoors in a rehabilitative capacity (409), most disabled 
people actually visit the outdoors for a host of other reasons including social 
inclusion, construction of identity, and personal wellbeing (410-2). Data were 
gathered from people with mental health difficulties, learning difficulties, visual 
impairments, and mobility issues (Burns et al. 2009, 408) to highlight the different 
barriers that disabled people may encounter in their enjoyment of outdoor leisure 
and how they can be linked to their disabilities. Likewise, Lehto et al. (2016) 
interviewed individuals with mobility, intellectual (learning), hearing, or visual 
disabilities to contrast the tourism experience of these individuals to that of their 
travelling companion (2). One of the things that they discovered was that whilst 
nondisabled people used tourism as a means of escaping the everyday (see also 
Ponsignon et al. 2021; Bodnar 2019; Smith and Kelly 2006), disabled tourists 
actually experienced a reinforcement of their everyday lives due to accessibility 
barriers at their destinations (Lehto et al. 2016, 4). Whilst analysing various 
complaints surrounding the inaccessibility of accessible hotel rooms, Wazzan (2015) 
used data provided by hotel guests with multiple types of disabilities. Although these 
disabilities were not disclosed, the types of access issues explored by Wazzan 
implied wheelchair users, blind or visually impaired guests, and guests with chronic 
conditions such as arthritis. They found that most accessible rooms were not 
designed with functionality in mind, like roll-in showers where a seated person 
cannot reach either the shower head or the taps to control it, thereby rendering the 
room inaccessible (Wazzan 2015, 5410), a rather ironic and frustrating outcome that 
emphasises the difficulty of disabled travel. By including people with a wide variety of 
disabilities, these surveys show how similar are the barriers that people with 
disabilities face. 
 
This point about uniformities in experiences is articulated more clearly in a more 
recent multi-disability survey. McKercher and Darcy (2018) present a multi-tiered 
system of disablement which offers disability scholars and service providers a more 
systematic way to look at accessibility. They argue that the barriers which prevent 

64 
 
disabled people from travelling are not fully homogeneous, but there are 
commonalities between them. These barriers can be divided into different tiers (see 
also Figure 1):  
• Tier 1: those common to all people (such as financial considerations). 
• Tier 2: those common to all people with disabilities (such as ignorant attitudes 
from nondisabled people). 
• Tier 3: those common to all people with a specific type of disability (such as a 
lack of accessibly-formatted information, i.e. Braille or large print guides). 
• Tier 4: those unique to each impairment (such as a location to charge a piece 
of medical equipment). (60)  
 
Figure 1. Taken from McKercher and Darcy 2018, 60. 
 
In discussion of these different tiers and how they affect a potential traveller, 
McKercher and Darcy (2018) expound upon what Tier 3 barriers may be for different 
types of disabilities. These include people with physical or mobility difficulties, people 
with a visual disability, people with hearing difficulties, and, importantly, intellectually 
or physically disabled children, which can be read as children with a learning 

65 
 
disability or who are neurodivergent (63). Although “intellectually or physically 
disabled children” still does not encompass as many people as it could (i.e., where 
do the access needs of a neurodivergent child and a neurodivergent adult diverge? 
Why could not both be considered?), it does acknowledge and explain that these 
kinds of hidden disabilities impact a traveller’s experience and even desire to travel 
in the first place. 
 
McKercher and Darcy’s research in particular informs a great deal of my research. I 
use their tier system in Chapter 8 to explain how proposed changes to my case 
study sites, based on input from my participants, would benefit a wide number of 
people, disabled and nondisabled alike. Research of this kind, encompassing a wide 
variety of disabilities and accessibility needs, is critical to understanding how to 
improve a site and society more widely to be more inclusive. Multi-disability surveys 
highlight the differences in disabled people’s experiences, but more importantly, they 
highlight the similarities. These similarities are borne out in my own research: people 
with different disabilities still encounter the same obstacles and can benefit from 
similar adjustments.  
3.2. Proposals to Increase Accessibility. 
But what could those adjustments include? Once a baseline of current accessibility 
offers is laid out, it is important to understand how to better accessibility at these 
sites. That is the question that underpins another line of related scholarship. In 
tourism research, studies on increasing accessibility can cover a multitude of 
different types of settings, from airlines (e.g., Chang and Chen 2011) to hotels (e.g., 
Tutuncu 2017) to different kinds of tourist attractions (e.g., Swaine et al. 2014). For 
example, Wan’s (2013) study of accessibility in Taiwan’s casinos offers several 
useful solutions that could be implemented at different types of tourist sites, as will 
be discussed below. However, her interviews were only conducted with people who 
are blind or who use a wheelchair or crutches (666). Although some of her 
suggestions, such as better staff disability awareness training (677), would benefit 
people with other disabilities, some suggestions, such as Braille buttons for slot 
machines (670), primarily or only benefit people with visual difficulties. This is not to 
imply that her findings are unimportant, but rather that studies that focus on only one 

66 
 
or two disabilities have limited potential for wider impact. Turning specifically to 
museums and heritage, there are several studies that lay out guidelines for 
improving accessibility for various disabilities. Kids in Museums, a group that 
provides advice and resources for museums to become more family-friendly, has put 
together two downloadable information packs to help museums become more 
accessible to different types of disabilities within families. One, which is for families 
with wheelchair users, includes practical steps for adjusting a current museum 
exhibition for better access. Some of these steps include spacing and heights of 
display cabinets, placement and text for signage, even pricing suggestions (Kids in 
Museums 2011, 2-3). The other, which is for autistic children, provides similar 
advice, such as providing visual stories so a visitor can familiarise themselves with 
the museum before visiting, assembling sensory backpacks for loans, even ideas for 
how to help limit sensory input that visitors with autism may find overwhelming (Kids 
in Museums 2018, 1-2). There is evidence that pre-visit materials, such as visual 
stories and floor maps of the museum, in particular help prepare autistic visitors 
(Langa et al. 2013, 328), proving the efficacy of these measures.  
 
Both these resources also emphasise talking to people with these disabilities for 
more ideas, as well as disability awareness training for staff and volunteers (Kids in 
Museums 2018 3; 2011 1). These are two common themes throughout most 
research into accessibility: talking to disabled people directly for their input and 
training staff in disability awareness (e.g., Mullins and Preyde 2013; Figueiredo et al. 
2012; Blichfeldt and Nicolaisen 2011; Burns et al. 2009; Shaw and Coles 2004). 
They are also two simple steps that apply to all disability types, as there is no 
disability that would not benefit from both. With training especially, one particular 
study with hospitality students showed that disability training, no matter the focus, 
increased positive attitudes towards disabled guests (Bizjak et al. 2011). I will return 
to this topic below, in section 3.3.2. 
 
There are other examples of museums publishing guidelines and toolkits to increase 
awareness and accessibility across the industry. In addition to the Kids in Museums 
resource, Lurio (2016, 185) published a paper specifically for helping historic houses 
be more welcoming to autistic visitors, citing the unique nature of historic houses 
(although they do not clarify what they mean by this “unique nature”), in contrast to 

67 
 
more traditional museums, as a potential for better engagement with this population. 
Others, such as Langa et al. (2013) and Kulik and Fletcher (2016), surveyed families 
of autistic children to understand their motivations for engaging with museums and 
heritage as a way to better reach these audiences. Langa et al. found that families 
with autistic children visited museums as a way to experience something together as 
a family and also to “encourage the child’s independence in exploring and 
experiencing” (2013, 329), although they also found that unpredictable stimuli were a 
barrier for many families, as they could not effectively prepare both themselves and 
their autistic children for these experiences (2013). Kulik and Fletcher found that 
whilst parents of autistic children appreciated autism-centric events, as it provided 
them with a sense of community with other families with autistic children, they were 
still frustrated and disappointed by the “stares and judgements they received from 
museum visitors and employees” during general operating hours (2016, 29). There 
are also examples of developing museum programming for D/deaf and hard of 
hearing audiences (Arts Council of Wales 2010) and visitors with dementia (Camic et 
al.  2017; Page et al.  2015; Rhoads 2009). For people with dementia especially, 
studies have shown that interaction in these museum-based programs provides 
them with social and physical stimulation, leading to increased mental health and 
overall well-being (Basting 2006; Cohen-Mansfield 2005; Silverman 2003). Again, 
autism and dementia feature very prominently as hidden disabilities that museums 
are keen to engage with, although little attention has been paid to other hidden 
disabilities such as dyslexia and chronic pain. 
 
It is unclear why autism and dementia figure so heavily in the literature, but I would 
contend that it has to do with a subtle form of ableism. Autism and dementia are 
commonly seen as affecting children and the elderly respectively (World Health 
Organization 2021a; O’Connor and McFadden 2012), although both can affect 
people of any age. These populations are somewhat distanced from adults, who, in 
an ableist mindset, are meant to be nondisabled and require no additional help 
(Robey et al.  2006). Adults with visible disabilities are still very often discriminated 
against, from employment opportunities to housing and are even the victims of 
higher rates of violence (Mueller et al. 2019; Vornholt et al. 2018; Verhaeghe et al. 
2016). Because of this, adults with hidden disabilities are often pressured to hide any 
special treatment they may need because of unwelcome scrutiny and policing by the 

68 
 
nondisabled population. Countless stories of adults being challenged for their use of 
blue badges and accessible toilets show in the news regularly, as well as multiple 
campaigns from various organisations to remind people that “not all disabilities are 
visible” (e.g., Crohn’s & Colitis UK 2021; O’Malley 2019). Yet there is still a sense of 
shame amongst many who have a hidden disability, one that makes them acquire 
coping mechanisms to help them “pass” as nondisabled (Menendez 2018; Carey 
2013; Cox 2013; Watson 2002). Even amongst other disabled people, those with 
hidden disabilities – especially chronic illnesses – are kept to the outskirts of the 
disabled community by those with visible disabilities. Even worse, people with hidden 
disabilities are sometimes outright denied “disabled” status, as they can “pass” as 
nondisabled (Griffiths 2020; Wendell 2001).  
 
Although research into accessibility for visibly disabled people has taken great 
strides, research into accessibility for people with hidden disabilities is still woefully 
inadequate: few have been asked what sites can do to better accommodate them.  
3.3. Current and Potential Barriers. 
In light of the gaps, it is imperative to consider the barriers that prevent changes from 
taking place around increasing accessibility. Although each situation and 
accessibility measure has its own particular challenges, three factors in particular 
emerge when examining the literature regarding the difficulty in implementing 
improved accessibility: cost, attitudinal barriers, and conservation concerns. I discuss 
each in turn below. 
3.3.1. Cost. 
An oft-cited reason for resistance to increasing accessibility is a lack of funds (Lynch 
and Proverbs 2020; Persson et al. 2015; Andani et al. 2013). Certainly, budgetary 
constraints are a valid concern, especially in an era of endless austerity, but this 
excuse is based on a false assumption; i.e., all accessibility measures are 
expensive. The installation of lifts and ramps is assuredly an expensive undertaking, 
but as has been shown throughout this chapter, those are not the only means of 
increasing a site's accessibility. So why is there such a disconnect between what 
managers believe accessibility entails and what disabled people actually need? 
 

69 
 
Research into this disconnect has shown one particular trend: managers simply have 
little contact with disabled people, and therefore have an inaccurate view of their 
needs. For example, Capitaine (2016) interviewed upper level hotel management 
and found that most of their interviewees, who were placed at levels which dictate 
hotel policy, had no concept of what an accessible hotel room would look like. They 
found that some respondents believed (Capitaine 2016, 201): 
• their hotels were accessible when a simple access audit found they were not; 
• disabled guests were often accompanied by a helper, which would inherently 
compensate for non-accessible rooms; 
• accessibility amenities were too difficult and "the boundary between adapted 
accommodation and hospital rooms was relatively difficult to establish". 
 
Even more worryingly, "establishments with the accent on outdoor activities did not 
necessarily see the interest in developing accessibility, saying this clientele was less 
able to participate in such activities" (Capitaine 2016, 201). Not only do these 
respondents show a shocking level of ignorance regarding the needs of disabled 
guests, they can even display dismissive, discriminatory attitudes that further 
alienate potential guests. Recall Burns et al.’s research, which showed a great 
disparity between outdoor leisure providers’ expectations of disabled visitors and the 
reality: most leisure providers assumed disabled people visited for rehabilitation 
purposes, whilst in reality, disabled people visited the outdoors for a wide array of 
reasons (2009). The inaccurate assumptions of these service providers regarding 
the needs of their disabled visitors lead to a dismissal of accessibility-related 
changes in the name of budgetary constraints. 
 
In an attempt to bridge divide service providers and disabled guests, Kim et al. 
(2012) surveyed disabled hotel guests to determine their experiences and needs, 
then interviewed hotel managers to see how feasible it would be to improve their 
facilities. Many of the suggestions put forward were met with positive responses from 
hotel managers, such as changing key cards to have a corner cut (2012, 1316). This 
small change allows people with low or no vision to know which way a card must be 
inserted to unlock a door, but also is useful for people with no visual impairment to 
recognise the right direction more easily for a key card, especially in low-light 

70 
 
situations such as at night. Changing the key card shape, a move which has 
improved the experience of all hotel visitors, is a far cry from the “hospital rooms” 
that respondents in Capitaine worried they had to provide.  
 
Additionally, as Lynch and Proverbs (2015) argue, many accessible improvements 
can be made without large budgets. In their research, they examined the 
implementation strategies of accessibility measures at Knole House, a National Trust 
property in Kent. They noted that several of these accessibility measures were of 
negligible cost (2015, 10), such as the inclusion of photographs on signs. As 
previously mentioned, Mesquita and Carneiro (2016, 384) likewise put forth 
inexpensive solutions for accessibility problems, such as handheld magnifiers. Many 
of the suggestions from Kids in Museums as well are inexpensive, such as visual 
stories and maps (2011; 1-2).  
 
Although financial investments are a reasonable consideration for any organisation, 
these surveys make it difficult to believe that cries of "budget!" are based in reality. 
Instead, they appear to be based on inaccurate assumptions on the part of upper 
level management in these organisations that are themselves influenced by ableist 
(and therefore discriminatory) attitudes. 
3.3.2. Attitudinal Barriers. 
Staff attitudes greatly influence the overall impression of a visitor's experience, 
especially disabled visitors (Su and Teng 2018; Pop and Borza 2015; Navarro et al. 
2014; Kim et al. 2012; Mey and Mohamed 2010). More often than not, they have a 
negative impact, as disabled people are often the victims of ableist attitudes. The 
idea that disabled people would not want to stay at a hotel with an emphasis on 
outdoor activities, as mentioned in Capitaine (2016), is an example of an ableist 
attitude. It presupposes a variety of things: that all disabled people have a physical 
or mobility-related impairment that prohibits their movement to a great extent; that 
disabled people have no desire to participate in the outdoors because of these 
impairments; that the only way to interact with the outdoors is through highly physical 
activities; that disabled people are only coming to these hotels to engage with their 
outdoor activity programmes as opposed to other offerings. All of these can be – and 
most, in fact, have been – discounted as false beliefs through a variety of research 

71 
 
(e.g., Burns and Graefe 2018; Burns et al. 2009; Shores et al. 2007), and yet the 
mindset remains even today. The impact of ableist attitudes cannot be discounted or 
underestimated, as they are as much a hindrance as any physical barrier someone 
may encounter. 
 
These discriminatory mindsets are well documented in a variety of tourism-related 
roles, such as: 
• travel agents (McKercher et al. 2003); 
• hotel managers (Capitaine 2016; Paez and Arendt 2014); 
• front of house staff (Bizjak et al. 2011; Bi et al. 2007; Card et al. 2006); 
• other tourists (Tchetchik et al. 2018). 
 
Although the attitudes of other tourists may be a delicate issue to address, it is 
imperative that the attitudes of service providers change. The negative experience of 
poor attitudes is a recurring theme amongst much of the literature (Su and Teng 
2018; Mey and Mohamed 2010; Pop and Borza 2015; Navarro et al. 2014; Kadir and 
Jamaludin 2013; Kim et al. 2012; Goodall et al. 2004), but it is something that is 
easily corrected. Several studies have shown the impact of simple disability 
awareness training and increased contact with disabled people, all positive 
improvements. Bizjak et al. (2011), for example, ran two focus groups with hospitality 
students. One group was given a lecture about the social and personal dimensions 
of disability, while the other group was given a lecture about the economic impact of 
disabled visitors in the hospitality sector (2010, 848). Both groups were given 
questionnaires before and after these lectures to measure attitudes towards disabled 
people, and both groups were shown to have significantly better attitudes towards 
disabled people after the lectures (2010, 854). Interestingly, there was no statistically 
significant difference between the attitudinal improvement between the groups, 
which led the researchers to posit that it did not entirely matter which aspect of 
disability the students were exposed to: simply introducing them to these issues was 
enough to produce positive results.  
 
Schitko and Simpson (2012) conducted a similar study on hospitality students, 
introducing an assignment about hotel accessibility to a number of students. At the 

72 
 
beginning and end of the term, all students were given surveys that, amongst other 
things, measured their attitudes towards disabled guests (2012, 328). They found 
that the inclusion of this assignment "softened" attitudes towards disabled people 
(2012, 333) and, more interestingly, this change lasted beyond the scholastic term. A 
year later, the researchers followed up with the students that had been given the 
assignment, and found they were able to recall information they had learned and 
their attitudes were still more positive than before they had been given the 
assignment (2012, 336). This suggests that even a small amount of exposure to 
disability issues is enough to heighten awareness and increase positive attitudes, an 
adjustment that can take place on many levels, either through formal education or as 
part of employer-based training. 
 
Daruwalla and Darcy (2005) conducted another study involving two groups: one of 
college and university students studying tourism and hospitality, and another of 
tourism industry professionals who were attending a disability awareness training 
session as part of a government mandate (555-6). Attitudes were measured prior to 
training and after the training, once immediately after the training and another follow-
up interview one month later. Again, any kind of training was shown to improve 
attitudes towards disabled tourists, but controlled interaction with a disabled person 
was most efficacious in creating long-term positive change (2005, 557). Likewise, at 
the follow-up interview, societal attitudes remained overall positive, although some 
personal attitudes had returned to pre-training levels (561). According to Daruwalla 
and Darcy, this difference between societal and personal attitudes suggests that 
consistent, ongoing interaction with disabled people maintains the overall positive 
attitude, as well as refresher training courses (562-3).  
 
Once again, it is not difficult to overcome this particular barrier to accessibility. 
Despite how wide-spread and impactful ableist attitudes are, it is fairly easy to 
challenge and change these attitudes, via training and exposure to disabled people, 
to create more welcoming, accessible environments.  
3.3.3. Conservation. 
Another potential hindrance people often cite in increasing accessibility is the 
concern of conservation, specifically the alteration of historical fabric. This is 

73 
 
particularly relevant in heritage, where sites themselves may be situated in listed or 
scheduled locations and therefore have a certain degree of protection afforded to 
them. Any change to their physical character must be carefully considered (Historic 
England 2016), and often, it is assumed by building owners that it is paramount to 
maintain the historical authenticity of a site. 
 
But is this actually the case? According to several disability experts, there is a 
tension and an inevitable compromise between accessibility and conservation. 
Pearne, for instance, puts forth a vexed argument that “facilities for disabled access, 
by definition, are symbols of modernity” and therefore must be managed carefully so 
as not to take away from the authenticity of a site (2011, 202). He cites the case of 
Lanhydrock, a National Trust property in Cornwall that installed a lift in the 18th 
century house. When the lift is not in use, it is hidden behind original oak panelling, 
“successfully disguising the ‘modern intruder’” (203). However, he then goes on to 
argue that “disabled visitors have the potential for being… distractions through their 
conspicuousness, caused by their disability” (205) – a striking statement, given that it 
is within a volume about the importance and necessity of accessible tourism. Is he 
asserting that the mere presence of disabled visitors (visibly disabled, at least) takes 
away from the ‘historicity’ of a heritage experience, as if disability did not exist in the 
past? Clearly, this is inaccurate, as disability or at least impairments have been 
found in archaeological contexts dating back to prehistory (Spikins 2013; Spikins 
2010; Oxenham et al. 2009; Sugiyama 2004), let alone the 18th century. Even his 
statement that “religious settings such as churches and cathedrals are worthy 
examples of vulnerable environments” (Pearne 2011, 202) where accessible facilities 
would encroach on the original aesthetic of the building is wrong. Religious settings, 
especially churches and cathedrals, were pilgrimage sites for all people, disabled 
and nondisabled alike in the medieval world (Chace 2017). True, they may not have 
conceptualised disability and accessibility in the same way that we do in the 21st 
century, but to imply that disabled people were scrubbed from existence and banned 
from such central social spaces as churches is not only historically inaccurate but 
worryingly ableist from a disability studies scholar. 
 
Pearne may be an extreme example, but he is not the only one who believes that 
conservation should win out over accessibility. Goodall et al. (2004, 354) put forward 

74 
 
a case for providing disabled visitors (by which they mean wheelchair users) 
alternative means of experiencing a heritage site rather than altering the fabric of the 
building. The ‘alternative means’ they suggest is some kind of visual tour of areas 
the visitors cannot access, such as a photo book or virtual reality model. Despite 
acknowledging that disabled people constitute a more diverse group than only 
wheelchair users, this is the only suggestion they provide for trying to bridge the gap 
between the apparently conflicting goals of access and conversation. Although theirs 
is certainly a valid suggestion, there are a great many other suggestions that could 
be put forward: touch tours, audio guides, even large print guidebooks offer ways to 
increase accessibility at a listed site without any encroachment on the historical 
fabric of the site. 
 
Oddly, these disability scholars seem to be arguing for beliefs that only they hold. 
The current methodology for heritage conservation revolves around “constructive 
conservation.” Historic England, then English Heritage, published several reports 
outlining the principles and examples of constructive conservation, calling it “a 
positive and collaborative approach to conservation that focuses on the active 
management of change in ways that recognise and reinforce the historic significance 
of places, while accommodating the changes necessary to ensure their continued 
use and enjoyment” (2013). In other words, it is less important to “freeze” a moment 
in a building’s history and more important to keep it functioning and usable to its 
current audience.  
 
Constructive conservation is not a theoretical concept either, but has been used 
effectively at multiple sites. Whitby Abbey, located in northern England, adapted 
Whitby Hall into a visitors centre for the Abbey using the constructive conservation 
method. Rather than tearing down the 17th century banqueting hall that had been 
deserted and, through disuse, become dilapidated, a steel framework was inserted 
within the Hall, allowing a modern 2-storey visitors centre to be built without 
damaging the historical fabric. Additionally, Coşkun points out that the “headland 
grounds were reworked to create a fully accessible setting which respected the 
historical significance” (2015, 6). Although they do not expound what “fully 
accessible” means, it does show that accessibility can be recognised and 
incorporated into a constructive conservation design. 

75 
 
 
Given constructive conservation, there should no longer be a battle between 
“preserving” an historical building and adapting it for accessibility. Not all accessibility 
measures need to be obtrusive, nor do all aspects of a listed building need to remain 
untouched by modern hands. Moreover, the idea that conservation must trump all is 
incorrect and discriminatory, and a great many accessibility measures are available 
that require little to no interaction with the historical fabric of a building. 
3.4. Summary. 
In examining the academic literature regarding accessibility, it is clear that although 
there is a prevalence of research on accessibility in tourism, and indeed, on 
accessibility in museums and heritage sites, little of it is focused on hidden 
disabilities. The research that does involve hidden disabilities focuses primarily on 
one or two types and also only considers a small portion of a disabled visitor’s 
experience. Three distinct strands of accessibility research are prominent (current 
state of accessibility, proposals to increase accessibility, and current and potential 
barriers), but rarely do they overlap with each other. With these limitations in mind, 
my research has been designed to address all three strands whilst also incorporating 
a wider range of hidden disabilities. 
 
 In the next chapter, I examine the current emphasis on Equality, Diversity and 
Inclusion in the heritage sector, discussing how my research can bolster these 
attempts at inclusivity where previous initiatives have failed. 
 
 

76 
 
Chapter 4 – Equality, Diversity, 
and Inclusion in the Museum 
and Heritage Sector. 
Having discussed the political and academic landscape of accessibility, it is 
important now to look at the wider landscape of inclusion in the heritage sector. 
There has been growing momentum for museums and heritage sites to become 
more inclusive in their audiences (Werner, Hayward, and Larouche 2014; Cerquetti 
2016; Martinez 2020), to challenge wrongs of the past (Giblin, Ramos, and Grout 
2019; Abungu 2019; Gelsthorpe 2021), and to have a more representative workforce 
(Jennings and Jones-Rizzi 2017; Eid 2018; Rende et al. 2021). However, this 
momentum has not always led to tangible, long-lasting change, and it is important to 
examine these successes and failures in order to ensure positive change takes 
place.  
 
In this chapter, I review and critique various initiatives in the museum and heritage 
sector relating to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) policies. First, I explain what 
EDI is, particularly in the UK. I then provide a general overview of some important 
disability-related initiatives that have occurred within the museum sector. As 
disability has seen less attention than other EDI initiatives (Bowens and Museums 
Association 2020), I then look to ethnicity-oriented initiatives, which have been more 
plentiful, to examine what lessons can be learned from their successes and failures. 
Finally, I discuss why past initiatives have not produced the sector-wide change that 
was hoped for, why current EDI strategies have greater potential for this change, and 
where my research fits into this growing body of theory and practice. 
4.1. Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion.  
When this research began, formalised inclusivity in the heritage sector was still 
finding its feet (Andermann and Arnold-de Simine 2012). Since then, multiple events 
have occurred to precipitate the need and desire for policies that actively work to 
include traditionally excluded populations. A turning point that many point to is the 

77 
 
murder of George Floyd in America (Jackson 2020; Museums Association 2021; 
Leeds Museums and Galleries 2022), which started a cascade of social uprisings, 
including the Black Lives Matter movement (Cappelli 2020; Thelwall and Thelwall 
2021; Bourdreau, MacKenzie, and Simmons 2022). Leeds Museums and Galleries, 
one of my case study organisations, references this event as a catalyst for the 
development of their EDI strategy, stating that “the murder of George Floyd by a 
police officer in Minneapolis on 25 May 2020 and the disproportionate impact of 
Covid-19 on black and ethnic minority people, have intensified LMG and Leeds City 
Council efforts to take further action to oppose racism (historic and present day) in all 
its forms and ensure that our practice truly reflects the diversity of the society we 
serve” (Leeds Museums and Galleries 2022, 8). Leeds Museums and Galleries is 
hardly alone in recognising the need for a more inclusive and diverse society, and 
multiple heritage organisations, as well as other sectors, have identified EDI as an 
important strategic strand in their recruitment and employee retention process 
(Natural History Museum 2021; National Trust 2022; English Heritage 2023).  
 
In the UK, EDI research covers more than just disability studies, relating to all 
protected characteristics as defined under the Equality Act, discussed in Chapter 2 
(2.1). As a reminder, protected characteristics include, among other characteristics, 
disability, age, and ethnicity (Equality Act 2010), and no one may be discriminated 
against because of these characteristics. To date, most research regarding EDI 
development has focused on ethnic equality in regards to staff demographics (e.g., 
Jennings and Jones-Rizzi 2017), visitor demographics (e.g., Werner, Hayward, and 
Larouche 2014), and especially representation within museum collections and 
exhibitions (Dodd et al. 2004; 2008; Research Centre for Museums and Galleries 
2012; 2014). There has been some EDI work done regarding disability inclusion 
within the heritage sector, particularly by the University of Leicester Museum Studies 
department (see more on this below), as well as organisations like VocalEyes. I will 
try to focus on disability-centred EDI initiatives within the museum sector, but will 
naturally have to expand and appraise initiatives relating to other protected 
characteristics. 

78 
 
4.2. Disability-based EDI.  
Disability-centred EDI initiatives are still few and far between in the museums and 
heritage sector, and tend to focus on diversifying museum staff and increasing 
disabled representation in museum collections and exhibitions. In this section, I 
examine some of this pioneering work. 
4.2.1. Increasing Disabled Staff. 
One of the earliest and longest-running diversity schemes was the Diversify initiative, 
pioneered by the Museums Association and initially sponsored in part by University 
of Leicester. Running 1998-2011, 130 participants took part, receiving training for 1-2 
years, “combining a university museum-studies masters qualification with a varied 
amount of paid work experience” (Davies and Shaw 2012, 2). At first, the initiative 
focused on recruiting people from an ethnic minority background to the programme, 
widening to include disabled people since 2008. The goal of the programme was to 
“make museum careers more accessible to people from Black, Asian and Minority-
Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds through targeted ‘positive-action’ training to prepare 
them to apply successfully for jobs in museums” (1). It also had a longer-term goal of 
increasing the number of minority-ethnic people in mid- and senior-level 
management roles in museums (1) and has been widely lauded as one of the most 
successful and impactful diversity initiatives within the sector (Jacobs 2011, 2). 
 
In reflecting upon the outcome of Diversify, Shaw importantly observed:  
Diversify did achieve more than the sum of its parts by encouraging museums 
actively to consider the value of a diverse workforce. But it has not altered the views 
of governing bodies and museum directors enough to make them change their wider 
thinking, their policies and processes or, in particular, their approach to recruitment 
and selection. (2013, 11) 
She found that although 98% of participants who responded to a survey “felt that 
Diversify had either been ‘very important’ or ‘important’ to them starting a career in 
the museum sector” (4), there is still a severe lack of diversity within the museum 
workforce. This, in turn, challenged the Museums Association, as the creator of the 
programme, to look deeper into why Diversify had “not necessarily translated widely 
into changes in organisational cultures or practices” (13). As is discussed below, 
they realised that change must be on an organisational level, not on an individual 

79 
 
level, and that the sector needed to “move away from relying on specific projects and 
initiatives” (18) and instead embed diversity within their practices more strategically.  
 
Shortly before the end of Diversify, the Museums Association commissioned a report 
to understand why there was such a lack of diversity amongst museum staff. 
Maurice Davies (2007, 10), who carried out the research and wrote the report, 
uncovered a great many barriers to entry into the workforce, including unintentionally 
discriminatory hiring practices. In order to address these barriers, he realised that 
“sector organisations, including the Museums Association and the Museums, 
Libraries and Archives Council, play only a very small role in entry to the workforce. 
They will have to play a part if things are to improve, as will Creative and Cultural 
Skills and university museum-studies courses” (7).  
 
The Museums Association took this call to action seriously, and has since become a 
driving force in advocating for positive change within the heritage sector. Within their 
founding documents, they specifically cite that one of their core values is to 
“champion diversity and equality” and “campaign for social and climate justice” 
(Museums Association 2023b). Their subsequent work has shown how committed 
they are to these values, particularly with their decolonising museums campaign. 
Their decolonisation work focuses on recognising and addressing the role of empire 
in the creation and maintenance of museums and their collections (Museums 
Association 2023a). Through the development of online resources, seminars, 
training programmes, and other tools for museums and heritage organisations to 
use, they have not only encouraged museums to take next steps towards more 
inclusivity, but have given them the support and knowledge to do so (Museums 
Association 2022). A particularly impactful case study is that of the Powell-Cotton 
Museum, which is built around the personal collections of English hunter and 
explorer Percy Powell-Cotton. With support from the Museums Association, the 
museum has shifted focus from the Powell-Cotton family to the cultures and people 
that Percy encountered and who supported him in his explorations and at home 
(Museums Association 2022). In doing so, they have created a far more inclusive 
collection with more diverse voices and stories than they had before. Work is still 
ongoing as well, to further decolonise their collections and co-create new exhibitions 

80 
 
to, as they say, “bring these silenced voices back into the building permanently” 
(Museums Association 2022). 
 
It is true that they currently have no campaign that specifically focuses on disability 
inclusion, but their workforce campaign does include EDI advocacy in addition to 
other concerns such as pay, conditions and well-being. As seen in their 
decolonisation work, there is not only great potential for the MA to address 
inequalities in the sector, but also evidence that they have begun to do so.  
4.2.2. Increasing Disabled Representation. 
Whilst Diversify and the Museums Association have focused on increasing disabled 
staff through the industry, there has also been work on representation of disabled 
people within museum exhibitions in the UK. A significant amount of this work has 
been carried out by the University of Leicester’s School for Museum Studies, but 
more recently, there have been other initiatives to include disabled people’s 
experiences, particularly through History of Place and its subsequent programme 
Curating for Change, which I discuss below. 
 
The University of Leicester’s School for Museum Studies has long been seen as the 
heart of research into disabled representation in collections as well as championing 
co-production with disabled people to explore and create these representations. 
They have had significant impact on the industry as well, particularly in amplifying 
disabled voices in temporary exhibitions. A recent report states that their “work is 
highly valued for enabling and supporting the sector in navigating the challenges of 
embedding equalities practice” (Shepley 2020, 15). I myself have taken great 
inspiration from their insistence on centring the lived experience of disabled people, 
and owe a great deal to their research.  
 
In particular, the School (and its associated Research Centre for Museums and 
Galleries, referred to as RCMG herein) has highlighted the need for more disabled 
representation in museum collections, explaining the need for such representation in 
their ground-breaking project Reframing Disability Representation: “Representation - 
seeing ourselves in cultural forms - matters; it changes people’s lives” (Dodd et al. 
2008, 22). An earlier project, Buried in the Footnotes, found that there was no lack of 

81 
 
disability-related material housed within museum stores, rather that there was a lack 
of understanding in how to sensitively and appropriately display these materials 
(Dodd et al. 2004, 5; 2008, 10). Reframing Disability Representation, as well as other 
research projects from the School, focused on representing the disabled experience 
in museum collections, particularly through co-production with disabled people. 
Indeed, their evaluation of the Reframing Disability Representation project showed 
that “many left the museum talking about disability differently, in ways that reflected 
the project’s overarching aim” (Dodd et al. 2008, 163).  
 
Acting on the UPIAS’ mantra “nothing about us without us,” RCMG has always been 
a leading proponent for amplifying the voices of disabled people through co-
production. Disabled people are always part of the process, whether as consultants 
(Dodd et al. 2008, 46), direct contributors (35), or as co-creators in the actual 
interpretation and final exhibition design (52). More recently, in partnership with the 
Wellcome Collection, a new permanent exhibition, “Being Human,” has been 
designed with consultation with various disability experts to de-medicalise and re-
humanise what it means to be human, including the experience of being disabled 
(Forde and Barlow 2020). Kate Forde, Head of Exhibitions for the Wellcome 
Collection, and Clare Barlow, Project Curator for Being Human, even acknowledge 
that it was RCMG’s work on a previous exhibition that encouraged them to reach out 
and partner with them in designing this new exhibition. Shepley noted that many 
involved with RCMG, both as individual participants and as partner institutions, 
reported “the impact of RCMG work on people with lived experience of disability and 
on museum professionals who are working on disability projects without this lived 
experience” (15). Without a doubt, RCMG is an industry leader in co-production with 
disabled people. 
 
However, within all these projects, the outcomes are still aimed at a non-disabled 
audience. In reading through their evaluation literature, the vast majority of 
comments are from non-disabled museum visitors who have interacted with their 
exhibits (Dodd et al. 2008, 141). Throughout the whole of their nearly 180-page 
report on Reframing Disability Representation, there are a total of three mentions of 
accessibility - and none of these mentions are particularly in-depth.  For example, in 
explaining the accessibility of the museums involved, RCMG merely states “all 

82 
 
museums were accessible and provided information in a range of formats” (10). One 
of the most basic principles of accessibility is that no place is fully accessible and 
details are required to determine how accessible a site is to a disabled person (Cock 
et al. 2018, 13). To simply state that “all museums were accessible” is not only an 
oversimplification, it minimises the importance of accessibility, further prioritising the 
experience of non-disabled people. 
 
That of course is not to diminish the importance of their work, particularly in 
emphasising co-creation with disabled people. In fact, heritage organisations that 
have worked with RCMG see them “as an ally who, through high quality research, 
creates sustainable links and who makes an impact through high-profile projects that 
benefit wider inclusivity in the cultural sector” (Shepley 2020, 26). The significance of 
RCMG’s work cannot be overstated, as they have encouraged more disabled 
representation in exhibitions and also the importance of co-creation with disabled 
people in these exhibitions.  
 
Another organisation that is championing co-creation with disabled people is 
Accentuate, in their past project History of Place and their current project Curating 
for Change. History of Place was a project that “revealed the presence and place of 
disabled people in relation to the built environment. These stories were told through 
the authentic voices of deaf and disabled people who founded, attended, visited and 
influenced building design and use from the Middle Ages to the present day” 
(Accentuate 2018, 8). They partnered museums with local disabled people and 
disability groups to research, design, and create these exhibitions, even if they 
erroneously state they are “the first project of its kind” (8) - something that RCMG 
has been doing for well over a decade. 
 
The partnership between Accentuate and the museums they worked with was 
another avenue to explore and increase accessibility. They explain they “also wanted 
to tackle some of the barriers deaf and disabled face when engaging with heritage. A 
crucial part of this was to provide training to heritage sites, event organisers and 
museums. This training helped people to recognise the barriers deaf and disabled 
people face as well as consider how best to address these” (Accentuate 2018, 23). 
Additionally, “Our accessible approach has been so successful that we created two 

83 
 
toolkits based on our experiences to share learning with museums and cultural 
organisations” (33). The History of Place project goes a step beyond many of the 
RCMG projects in that it prioritised the inclusion of disabled people as visitors in 
addition to co-creators, thereby allowing disabled people to explore their own history 
rather than being excluded from it.  
 
In explaining the importance of co-creation, Accentuate states that “by engaging with 
deaf and disabled people in the design and creation of exhibitions, films and digital 
games, it is possible to deliver accessible experiences that authentically describe 
their histories from their perspective” (2018, 4).For example, video games created 
through this project included audio description, subtitles, and BSL (20) - features that 
are rarely available in mainstream video games, let alone games created in the 
context of a museum. 
 
I discuss their newest initiative, Curating for Change, in Chapter 3, explaining that it 
will provide placements for sixteen disabled people, giving them practical experience 
in the heritage workforce and theoretically paving the way for more disabled 
inclusion in the museum sector. Curating for Change is a direct result of History of 
Place, and is seen as the next step in bringing disabled people into heritage. Where 
History of Place was about co-creation, with museum professionals working 
alongside disabled people to create these exhibitions, Curating for Change is about 
training disabled people to be museum professionals. Accessibility is likewise 
embedded within this programme, with Accentuate pointing out that “exhibitions and 
displays are predominantly designed for ‘normal’ bodies, with minimal consideration 
given to how D/deaf, disabled and neurodivergent people will navigate and/or 
experience them” (Accentuate 2018, 4).  
 
Furthermore, Accentuate recognises that Curating for Change promises change, and 
they hope that “these placements will begin to embed change within museums, 
generating learning to be shared more widely across the sector” (4). Given the 
prominence of many of the museums taking part in the programme, such as the Pitt 
Rivers Museum and the Ashmolean in Oxford and the National Railway Museum, 
and the current trend of implementing EDI strategies, there is great potential for 
change within the sector for Curating for Change, which is running from 2022 to 

84 
 
2024, to fulfil its aim of “greatly increas[ing] the number of disabled people visible in 
the sector” (Accentuate 2023). Sixteen disabled people perhaps does not seem like 
a huge increase, but the visibility of the project and the cultural atmosphere of today 
means that more disabled people will be encouraged to enter the heritage sector. As 
Shaw points out, “lack of diversity in the profession discouraged people from 
different backgrounds from aspiring to enter it, perpetuating the imbalance” 
(Accentuate 2021, 5). 
 
Although they are largely similar, there is a subtle difference between RCMG and 
Accentuate in the final goal of their projects. For RCMG, their exhibitions aim to 
positively change cultural ideas of disability and disabled people’s place in history 
(Dodd et al. 2008, 12). For Accentuate, they “set out to be fully accessible and place 
deaf and disabled people’s heritage front and centre within museum programming” 
(Accentuate 2019, 9). RCMG is arguably aimed at nondisabled people; Accentuate 
is aimed at disabled people. Neither is inherently better, as both branches are 
important to the inclusion of disabled people, and ultimately, both feed into each 
other. By influencing nondisabled people to have a more welcoming view of disabled 
people, they encourage nondisabled people to notice accessibility. By ensuring 
exhibitions are fully accessible, disabled people are more visible as visitors and bring 
nondisabled people into contact with them, creating more positive attitudes towards 
disabled people. 
4.3. Lessons from Ethnicity-based EDI Initiatives. 
As previously mentioned, the Museums Association’s Diversify initiative began as a 
way to increase the number of minority-ethnic staff in the museums and heritage 
sector. Indeed, the relative (if limited) success of that initiative has left a lasting 
impression on the sector, and there are many lessons to be learned from not only 
Diversify, but other ethnicity-based EDI initiatives. In addition to the Diversify 
initiative, other programmes include: 
• Inspire Fellowship Programme - “for aspiring culturally diverse curators” (Iniva 
2006) 
• Change Makers - increasing cultural diversity of senior leaders (Arts Council 
England 2018) 

85 
 
• Black Blossoms - showcasing artists from diverse backgrounds (Black 
Blossoms 2023) 
• Black Curators Collective - forum for Black women and non-binary curators 
(BBC 2021) 
 
In 2022, a report combining research from Museum X and Culture&, both Black-led 
organisations, was funded by the Arts Fund to “assess the impact of ethnic diversity 
initiatives on the curatorial workforce in the UK arts and heritage sector” (Art Fund, 
Culture&, and Museum X 2022, 6). Broadly speaking, the initiatives had little impact, 
leading the authors of the report to comment “there is a deeply frustrating structural 
lag in the diversification of staffing at our national museums and galleries'' (3), a 
sentiment echoed by other minority groups in the sector (Bowen and Museums 
Association 2020). They discovered that there were still structural barriers that 
prevented minority-ethnic staff from either progressing or even entering the 
workforce, much like Shaw’s examination had in 2013 (14).  
 
In addition to conducting their own qualitative survey with 40 museum professionals 
in curatorial positions, the report examined a large number of previous diversity 
initiatives in the museum and heritage sector, including the Diversify initiative 
discussed above. The results of the examination were that diversity initiatives were 
inconsistent at best, with the impact being largely dependent on “who in the 
institutions was initiating and organising [the initiative] and the intentionality of their 
overall ambition” (Art Fund, Culture&, and Museum X 2022, 56). In other words, and 
as evidenced elsewhere in their report, without support from senior management nor 
specific targets, these initiatives “can only have had minimal impact of diversifying 
the demographics of the UK curatorial sector” (56). Despite admirable intentions, 
significant change has yet to take place. In fact, the report reveals that any change 
that has been achieved “has been largely due to individual personal drive and 
ambitions rather than the programmes themselves” (7). 
 
With a lack of structural support, professionals from minority groups instead created 
peer-to-peer networks, a significant one being Museum Detox. This particular 
network was founded for and by museum professionals of colour with the aim to 

86 
 
“empower and support each other to heal, to be ourselves, and to reclaim our 
history” (Museum Detox 2022). There is less of an outward advocacy emphasis to 
the network, instead creating a safe space for members to set aside many of the 
pressures that come from working in such a predominantly White industry. Indeed, 
their impact has been largely as a support structure, with one report revealing that 
“Museum Detox was noted by a number of respondents as being a key source of 
peer support and encouragement, assisting its members in dealing with difficulties 
they face as employees in arts and heritage organisations” (Art Fund, Culture& and 
Museum X 2022, 57). 
 
If one thing can be learned from these ethnicity-oriented initiatives, it is the 
importance of peer-to-peer networks to provide support. The Disability Collaborative 
Network (DCN) was created to provide such support, although not quite in the same 
way as Museum Detox. There is more of an emphasis on sharing best practice 
amongst museums at DCN, but they did attempt to launch a network specifically for 
neurodiverse museum professionals in 2018 (Disability Collaborative Network 2023). 
Unfortunately, the network no longer seems to exist. Since then, the Neurodiverse 
Museum has been created, with an aim to create such a network for neurodiverse 
people as well as advocate for a shift in how museums view neurodiversity (The 
Neurodiverse Museum 2023).  
4.4. Discussion. 
In examining even the most successful of these EDI initiatives, one thing is clear: 
increasing diversity within the industry has been a slow and limited process. Even 
ethnicity-based initiatives, which have had the most momentum and arguably the 
largest impact, have not brought the heritage industry up to representative levels (Art 
Fund, Culture&, and Museum X 2022). In 2013, Shaw noted that “If the museum 
sector is working towards a representative workforce, the percentage of museum 
staff from minority-ethnic backgrounds should be around 12%, not 7%” (13). 
Unfortunately, this number has not increased, but has actually decreased, with only 
6% of the museum workforce coming from a minority-ethnic background in 2022 
(Arts Council England 2019, 8). Ali and Byrne, in their 2022 analysis of “the micro-
institutional ways in which diversity is performed” (1) in the museum and TV 

87 
 
production industries, determined that “diversity schemes [are] a ‘quick fix’” (3) and 
that “using umbrella terms such as diversity undermines the complexities of 
addressing different and intersecting inequalities” (5). This is in direct contrast to 
Shaw’s conclusions nearly a decade prior that “positive-action training is not 
intended to have an immediate impact, but to create long-term changes in the 
workforce” (2013, 12). Unfortunately, this advice has not been heeded, and the 
sector has suffered for it, relying on “quick fixes” instead of using these diversity 
schemes to critically examine barriers to participation and embed the importance of 
equality and diversity within their organisations. 
 
In reviewing previous EDI initiatives, I must agree with both Shaw and Ali and 
Barnes. Originally, these programmes were created to enact long-term change by 
initiating first steps, by actively removing barriers for diverse people to enter the 
museum and heritage workforce. However, they were only ever intended to be short-
term, relying on institutions to do the work of embedding lessons learned from 
participation in these programmes. Shaw writes:  
Institutions need to accept responsibility for diversity and ensure it is championed 
right at the top, starting with the governing body. The role of leadership in creating an 
environment that supports inclusive working practices is paramount. The people at 
the top determine priorities, set strategy and create policies for the whole 
organisation. If museum leaders don’t take action, change will be limited (Shaw 2013, 
14) 
This is why I was so keen to examine the organisational structures of my case study 
sites - by examining these structures, it would be easier to understand the 
organisational barriers to implementing accessibility. Within my case study 
organisations, I did not find a lack of enthusiasm for accessibility. Indeed, I found 
quite the opposite; each organisation was eager to increase accessibility, but they 
were unsure how to do so (see Chapter 10). Additionally, at the beginning of my 
research, there was little to no institutional policy that outlined the importance not 
only of accessibility but of inclusion more generally. Since then, all three 
organisations have published or are in the process of publishing EDI strategies, 
which I discuss below in 4.4.2 - these policies represent the start of accepting 
responsibility and moving forward to a more inclusive future.

4.4.1. Lessons from the Past. 
The most important lesson from previous attempts at diversity is that organisations 
must commit internally to increasing diversity. This may seem paradoxical, as the 
above evidence shows that past initiatives have done little to increase diversity in the 
museum sector. However, the difference between this suggestion and past initiatives 
is the emphasis on an internal commitment. Shaw points out that “having more 
projects and initiatives is not the answer. There needs to be a more holistic approach 
that tackles all the barriers to change” (2013, 4). For change to occur, there cannot 
be an external group providing “diversity hires” for an organisation. All the motivation 
and impetus must come from the organisation, which then has a greater likelihood of 
translating intention into long-term change. As Ali and Byrne point out, “diversity 
schemes as a route for implementing diversity in the institution…  are seen as 
practical, though insufficient, first steps” (2022, 17-18). In “It’s about handing over 
power,” the authors likewise point out that “from the most recent quantitative data… 
these programmes can only have had minimal impact on diversifying the 
demographics of the UK curatorial sector” (Art Fund, Culture&, and Museum X 2022, 
56). The same paper found “a lack of prolonged investment and a lack of institutional 
strategy which means schemes are segregated and fail to achieve more structural 
changes. Diversity schemes are often problematically understood as a one-way 
stream, benefiting only the ethnically diverse ‘recipient’” (13). I will return to this 
problematic, paternalistic view below, but it is clear that these initiatives rely too 
heavily on temporary outside influence and do little to change the internal culture of 
an organisation. 
 
Because of this lack of attention, there is a suggestion that sometimes, these 
initiatives do as much harm as they do good. In discussing the Diversify programme, 
reviewed above, the authors write “little attention given to the organisational culture 
of the host organisation, nor to how existing staff would feel about having a trainee 
placed in the organisation. One interviewee described being questioned by staff in 
the host organisation about why she had been given this opportunity, which forced 
her to respond she had been chosen because of her ethnicity” (Art Fund, Culture&, 
and Museum X 2022, 41). As I discuss in Chapter 8, many of my participants disliked 
the idea of having to disclose their disabilities, as it may invite negative biases 

89 
 
towards them and therefore have a negative impact on their experience. Likewise, 
this interviewee had to disclose their ethnicity and that their position in the 
organisation was solely based on that characteristic which in turn impacted her 
experience.  
 
As mentioned above, there is an implication that these schemes are only beneficial 
for the “diversity hire” - they are being given an opportunity that they would not 
otherwise have due to the benevolence of the organisation. This speaks to a 
paternalistic attitude within these organisations. As Ali and Byrne (2022, 13) write, 
“institutions perform acts of inclusion to maintain their ‘morally good’ status,” making 
these inclusions little more than empty gestures. It feels as if museums are trying “to 
make pro-diversity sound like a positive action, rather than a response to historical 
exclusion” (Minott and Museums Association 2020), meaning they are not engaging 
with the difficult work of dismantling existing power structures that benefit a more 
traditional, exclusive workforce. Framing diversity as a “morally good” thing to do 
presents “a danger of indulging in self-praise – praise that echoes paternalistic 
behaviours of the past, casting the institutions as benevolent and visitors as passive 
recipients of grace” (Minott and Museums Association 2020).  
 
For this reason, many museum organisations such as the Museums Association and 
Museum Detox are calling for museum and heritage organisations to not only 
become passively inclusive, but actively anti-discriminatory (Museum Detox 2022; 
Museums Association 2023a). Anti-discrimination is the process of not only repealing 
discriminatory practices, but embedding practices that work towards equality. The 
Equality Act, with its provision of “reasonable adjustments,” is an example of anti-
discrimination work, as is the example above of the Powell-Cotton Museum. In each 
of these instances, steps are taken towards more inclusion, actively reaching out to 
underserved and underrepresented populations and addressing barriers to their 
engagement. In this context, much emphasis is placed on anti-racism and 
decolonisation work - something that makes sense in the current political climate - 
but the same change to active anti-discrimination applies to disability inclusion and 
accessibility as well. 
 

90 
 
Additionally, these schemes can reduce brilliantly capable people to mere statistics. 
Harkening back to the example above where a participant was forced to disclose that 
they were part of a diversity scheme, they were suddenly reduced to their ethnicity 
with other staff members “seeing them through the limited prism of their ethnicity and 
amplifying that at the expense of professional development and career progression” 
(Art Fund, Culture&, and Museum X 2022, 14) and judging them “as ‘out of place’ 
and potentially inferior” (13). Not only do existing staff members question the validity 
of a “diversity hire,” but Ari and Byrne (2022) found that “these diversity schemes can 
invite self-doubt about one’s own skills and contribution to the sector, or what was 
described as an ‘imposter syndrome’. Thus, paradoxically, even though these 
schemes are designed to empower ethnically diverse creatives and cultural workers, 
they can contribute to a sense of insecurity” (14).  
 
Part of this insecurity comes from inorganically forcing participants of diversity 
schemes into an institutional culture that is not necessarily open to their inclusion. 
The heritage sector is overwhelmingly white, middle class, and non-disabled (Arts 
Council England 2019), something anecdotally confirmed at my case study sites. 
Because of this privileged background, many institutions have a hard time seeing 
their own biases, meaning that “the cultural whiteness of most institutions they 
[participants in diversity schemes] access and the structural inequality of the sector 
as a whole make these spaces alienating” (Art Fund, Culture&, and Museum X 2022, 
18). This alienation can be seen in acts such as the above example - questioning the 
presence of an ethnically diverse new member of staff - as well as more common 
practices such as standard holidays based on the Christian calendar. In other words, 
organisations are ignoring the strengths that diversity brings and instead pressuring 
staff to fit into a predefined mould - “at best, failing to recognise the value of an 
ethnically diverse workforce beyond their ethnicity, and, at worst, reproducing 
discriminatory and racist attitudes and practices” (14). 
 
By forcing people to fit into an existing institutional culture rather than encouraging 
the culture to embrace diversity and adapt, these institutions are creating an 
additional burden for participants in diversity schemes, which is the opposite of what 
these schemes are created to do. There is an incredible amount of internal work 
required to “pass” in a discriminatory system, often referred to as ‘emotional labour.’ 

91 
 
Ari and Byrne (2022) found that participants in diversity schemes “have to negotiate 
myriad racial, cultural and social codes and practices that at best leave them drained 
and at worst push them outside of the sector” (13). Worse, because of the 
paternalistic attitude, many people in this position are expected to be grateful 
because they are being given an opportunity that they would not otherwise have 
access to and thus have no right to complain about discrimination or less than 
desirable conditions. Networks like Museum Detox and DCN have proven to be an 
important support system for certain heritage members, but there continue to be 
calls for “an acknowledgement and open dialogue with everyone involved about the 
emotional labour it takes to contribute” (Art Fund, Culture&, and Museum X 2022, 
31). 
 
Emotional labour is not limited to participants, either. Ari and Byrne (2022) discuss 
how “the work to diversify the sector is falling on the shoulders of ethnically diverse 
people, which can add to the fatigue they experience and increased workload which 
might affect progression ambitions and have ramifications on their emotional and 
mental wellbeing” (15). It seems as if, when internal schemes are organised, they 
are driven by an individual - more often than not, one of the “ethnically diverse 
employees in the organisation” (15) - rather than by a shift in the organisational 
culture. Because these internal schemes are the result of only a small number of 
staff members, there is a lack of support from the wider organisation or even senior 
management, which again makes it difficult for wider change to occur. As Shaw 
(2013) pointed out 10 years ago, “There needs to be a shift in emphasis from the 
individual to the institution, with organisations as a whole recognising their 
responsibility for workforce diversity” (10).  
4.4.2. Progress and Change. 
EDI strategies are where institutional responsibility is codified. The Museums 
Association published their EDI policy in 2020, providing a framework for other 
organisations. As discussed above, the Museums Association is seen as an industry 
leader and their policy includes how they define “equality,” “diversity,” and 
“inclusivity” as well as specific responsibilities for various segments of senior 
leadership, including the Board of Trustees (Minott and Museums Association 2020). 
There are also specific procedures and outputs outlined, plus how often the policy 

92 
 
will be reviewed. For the most part, it is a standard policy document, which is 
important in positioning EDI alongside any other significant policy in a heritage 
organisation. The standardisation means that EDI is not a trendy new idea, merely 
one that is finally gaining the attention it deserves and thus can be treated like any 
other policy, with the same mechanisms to hold institutions accountable. 
 
Of my three case study organisations, both the National Trust and Leeds Museums 
and Galleries have a published EDI policy on their website. Whilst York 
Archaeological Trust does not currently have one published, this is because the 
policy is currently being put together - I am on the team that is creating the 
document. There is a strong dedication within YAT to create this document, and 
because of my background, there will likely be an emphasis on the inclusion of 
disabled people within the document. In time, this policy will be available on our 
website in line with best practices as set out by the Museums Association. 
 
The National Trust EDI document (2022) is more detailed than the Museums 
Association policy, partly because the document also includes what they are 
currently doing in regards to EDI, complete with case studies, as well as future 
programmes and specific goals. Happily, alongside initiatives aimed at ethnic 
equality, religious diversity, and LGBTQ+ representation, there are several specific 
mentions of accessibility throughout the document. For example, they specifically 
mention “improving the consistency of the accessibility information we offer online 
and in our handbook, as well as improving our website and app so they’re accessible 
for all users” (6).  This is incredibly refreshing, as the Museums Association policy 
does not mention accessibility at all. As I discuss below, disabled people have a 
different experience of inclusion, as there are physical barriers in addition to 
attitudinal barriers that continue to exclude them from museums and heritage. 
Therefore, the specific mentions of accessibility, both in their case studies (8) and in 
their future goals (3), is encouraging. There is a concrete dedication to disabled 
people that is often lacking in many EDI documents.  
 
Leeds Museums and Galleries have a detailed EDI policy as well, focusing 
especially on where they can improve, how they will improve, and a timeline of when 
and how they will report on these improvements. Like many EDI documents, there is 

93 
 
very little mention of accessibility, though they do include a general “improve our 
accessibility” (16) aim. The lack of specificity of this particular aim is somewhat 
disappointing, as it remains too vague to truly measure improvement. However, most 
of their outcomes and goals are related to ethnic equality - something that does 
make sense, given that Leeds is an incredibly ethnically diverse city.  
 
One thing the National Trust and Leeds Museums and Galleries policies have in 
common is the measurable targets that they lay out. Ari and Byrne (2022) suggest 
“adding realistic and actionable targets, review dates and accountability measures” 
(11) to EDI policies, something that both National Trust and Leeds Museums and 
Galleries do in their documents. Leeds Museums and Galleries especially lays out 
how they will report their progress, as well as specific methods for achieving each of 
their outcome goals (27) shown below in figure 2. By laying out precisely how they 
will report their progress and also publishing their EDI policy to the general public, 
they are inviting members of the public to keep them accountable and to push them 
in achieving these goals.  
 

94 
 
 
Figure 2. Data collection and reports for LMG (taken from Leeds Museums and Galleries 2022, 27) 
Likewise, the National Trust document also outlines how they will measure their 
progress, though they are not as detailed as to how they will publish these results.  

95 
 
 
Figure 3. How National Trust will measure their progress (taken from National Trust 2022, 9). 
 
It is important to note that they specify that their initial goal is creating a more 
inclusive organisational culture. As discussed above, if the inclusive culture is 
lacking, it is difficult to make any lasting progress in EDI. 
 
Something lacking in both the EDI policies of the National Trust and Leeds Museums 
and Galleries is specific quantitative targets, although this may be because many of 
the stated goals are more qualitative than quantitative in nature. However, if any 
organisation prioritises increasing the diversity of their staff and volunteers, there 
must be numerical targets in mind - or at least a numerical representation of the 
organisation status quo to understand improvements. In discussing EDI policies, Ari 
and Byrne (2022) observe that these targets “remained mercurial with one senior 
member of the staff commenting: ‘I think it’s definitely an abstract goal’” (11). It is 
worrying that even a senior staff member sees these goals as abstract, and perhaps 
maintaining EDI demographics and statistics is a way to concretise the abstract. The 

96 
 
museum sector already maintains visitor demographics as a way to measure visitor 
diversity, and Ari and Byrne point out “there was considerable emphasis in staff 
meetings on the numerical and demographic profile of visitors to showcase diversity 
(11)” in their ethnographic research. Likewise, there have been calls for “diversity 
targets on staffing and audiences” (Arts Fund, Culture&, and Museum X 2022, 23), 
but this has been made difficult by the fact that the DCMS has not published any 
targets for cultural organisations to aim for. 
 
However, as with any other policy created by an organisation, simply writing a policy 
is not the same as enacting it. As Ari and Byrne (2022) put it: “Policies can be a 
statement of intent – or guidance intended to ensure legal compliance with the 
Equality Act. But they do not necessarily have an impact on practice” (12). Once 
these policies are in place, there must be action. That is why targets are important - 
but as seen by earlier initiatives (and emphasised in the National Trust policy), there 
must be a change throughout the whole culture of the organisation for these policies 
to be effective.  
 
In order for an organisation to truly commit to a cultural shift, these strategies and 
themes must be discussed regularly and by staff and volunteers at all levels. As of 
right now, there seems to be a lack of this daily engagement, as Ari and Byrne 
observed “through our institutional ethnography, explicit engagement with diversity 
as a policy or strategic aim was largely absent, lost in the more pressing business of 
the institution” (12). Thus far in the cultural sector, pushes to increase diversity have 
been a top-down goal without any input from people who actually engage with the 
public or have influence over hiring practices. There needs to be dialogue between 
all levels of management as well as between all teams within an organisation in 
order for people to not only understand these changes but the impetus behind them.  
 
When examining my case study sites, I believe that two out of the three sites are 
primed for a cultural shift amongst their staff. At both Abbey House and Barley Hall, 
front of house members are able to offer suggestions to more senior staff and in 
many cases, these suggestions are put into practice. As I discuss in Chapter 9, there 
is an open, fluid flow of communication between staff of all levels and belonging to all 
teams which has led to accessibility improvements. Naturally, there will be difficulties 

97 
 
in the implementation of these policies, but at both of these sites, I already 
encountered an attitude of inclusion towards disabled people, and I believe that this 
same attitude of inclusion will eventually be extended towards all protected 
characteristics. Particularly at Leeds Museums and Galleries, there is already a 
significant focus on ethnic diversity and inclusion, which gives me confidence that 
they will succeed in their cultural shift towards inclusion. 
 
The National Trust, as testified to in my interviews with Dr Heather Smith, Equity 
Officer for the National Trust, is striving to achieve such a similar cultural shift. There 
are several initiatives being implemented to support the EDI strategy, which I discuss 
in Chapter 11, and these initiatives are internally-focused with measurable outcomes 
and importantly, funding to improve accessibility. I believe the challenges I saw at 
Treasurer’s House were specific to that site, rather than the organisation as a whole. 
The new EDI strategy will certainly help address some of these challenges, but I 
believe it will take more work at Treasurer’s House in order to fully enact this 
strategy.  
 
However, the breadth of these strategies highlights an important point when 
discussing EDI: disabled people have a very different experience of discrimination 
than people from other protected characteristics. In addition to attitudinal barriers, 
there are physical barriers that prevent disabled people from engaging with heritage, 
either as a visitor or as a professional. Reflecting on the Diversify project, “fellows 
with disabilities commented on the difficulties of achieving an appropriate balance 
between managing the symptoms of their disability and career ambition” (Jacobs 
2011, 3). Ari and Byrne (2022) point this out as well, explaining that “whilst 
inequalities based on these social categories [aka protected characteristics] are all 
important, using umbrella terms such as diversity undermines the complexities of 
addressing different and intersecting inequalities'' (5). Although they were discussing 
this in relation to ethnic equality and the danger of depoliticising ethnic 
discrimination, I argue that it is equally true of disability discrimination. Strategies that 
work to include the LGBTQ+ population may not help to include disabled people, and 
so these differences must be remembered when developing EDI strategies.  

98 
 
4.4.3. Importance of Accessibility in EDI. 
In a report on the impact of the RCMG’s work, one participant said:  
While discussions of diversity and inclusion are becoming much more prominent in 
certain aspects of museum work...disability remains pretty much invisible even in this 
context. When disability does come up, it is invariably about accessibility, with no 
acknowledgement or recognition of disability culture and identity or of disability art, 
and no understanding of the concept of ableism. (quoted in Shepley 2020, 6) 
The wider message of this quote is important, that disability is underserved in most 
diversity work, but the dismissal of the importance of accessibility is interesting to 
note. This is why I focused so exclusively on accessibility within my own research. I 
have found many researchers exploring how to better acknowledge disability history 
(Dodd et al. 2008) or how different disabilities impact a visitor’s understanding of a 
building (Schofield et al. 2020) or even how to dismantle barriers to employment for 
disabled people (Khan et al. 2019). However, at the heart of all of this work, there is 
an assumption that the work of understanding accessibility has been done. As seen 
in Chapter 3, however, the existing research is by no means exhaustive. Further 
study into accessibility is still critical for disabled people to take part in heritage, 
whether as a professional, a visitor, or some mix of the two.  
 
My research will show that accessibility is not a “one and done” exercise; 
organisations must constantly seek out feedback from visitors and staff members to 
increase the accessibility of their sites. The same mindset permeates EDI research, 
that organisations must constantly review their policies and action plans to adjust as 
necessary in order to reach their targets. Accessibility research is just a small part of 
the wider EDI landscape, but it is a critical part that must not be overlooked if 
organisations are serious about including disabled people.  
4.5. Summary. 
As Ali and Byrne (2022) rightly point out, “there is yet a long way for diversity to be 
structurally embedded in the institutional life of cultural organisations, and it is only 
through this overhaul of institutional culture that we are to reach a more equitable 
sector” (18). Many previous initiatives have had only a limited impact on improving 
diversity and inclusion. However, the new emphasis on EDI strategies, making 
diversity and inclusion an enshrined policy amongst many heritage organisations, is 

99 
 
a hopeful turn towards this structural embedding. My research parallels much of 
what EDI scholars have said in regards to enacting these policies: consultation is 
crucial, communication across an organisation paramount, and it is not enough to be 
inclusive, an organisation must work to be anti-discriminatory.  
 
In the next chapter, I explain my methodology, which was informed by these three 
strands of research within accessibility studies. 
 
 

100 
 
Chapter 5 – Methodology. 
In this chapter, I outline my methodology: how I gathered data, how I analysed it, and 
the various decisions that led to the overall research output. I begin with an overview 
of qualitative data processes and why qualitative research is the most appropriate 
option for me. I then explain my main framework for gathering data: focused 
ethnography. From there, I describe how focused ethnography is utilised with my 
participants, who all identify as people with hidden disabilities. Then, I outline my 
research design for gathering data from my case study organisations. Finally, I 
discuss my use of Critical Discourse Analysis to analyse the data I have gathered. 
5.1. Qualitative Approaches. 
This research relies exclusively on qualitative data collection procedures. I felt that a 
deeper analysis of the lived experience of my participants was preferable to a broad 
approach, as the range of hidden disabilities is vast and too ambitious for this 
research. Instead, by selecting a cross-section of people with hidden disabilities and 
learning from them, I sought to gain a fuller understanding of the barriers faced by 
my participants. My rationale for participant selection is described below (see section 
5.2.1.3), but careful attention has been paid to ensure no one hidden disability type 
dominates the data and instead a deep, thorough understanding of each participant’s 
accessibility needs is acquired. 
 
There are many instances where quantitative data methods are particularly relevant 
to understanding the impact of disability, and have the potential to lead to changes 
that aid disabled people. For example, Kim and Lehto (2013) examined over 160 
families of disabled children to determine motivations and activities when planning 
family trips. They developed a structured survey asking families to rank how much 
they agreed or disagreed with particular statements regarding their family leisure 
trips (2013, 15-16). These survey answers were then analysed and ranked to give 
researchers a clearer picture of these leisure motivations and activities. It was found 
that the primary motivation was to “develop children’s physical skills and 
competences” (2013, 19) and their preferred leisure destination was an outdoor 
recreation area that required low energy levels, such as nature walks or bird 

101 
 
watching (20). These findings can be then fed to service providers, as the 
researchers themselves have suggested (Kim and Lehto 2013, 21-22), to aid in 
creating more appropriate disability-specific offerings as well as adapting existing 
activities to be more inclusive to the families of disabled children. Quantitative data 
are often utilised to gain a bigger picture of an issue, to determine the overarching 
themes such as the motivations and activities in Kim and Lehto’s survey, and 
therefore to help enact change based on the findings. 
 
In contrast, qualitative data are often employed to examine the nuances not evident 
in quantitative data-based research. Burns et al. 2009 used interviews and focus 
groups to gather qualitative data about the experience of disabled people when 
visiting outdoor landscapes, particularly woodlands. After recruiting participants, they 
they sought to learn about these participants’ particular access needs in order to 
enable them to participate in the study’s focus groups in the first place. Many sites 
had to be discounted as potential venues for the focus groups because of a lack of 
amenities, such as accessible toilets or visitor facilities, and travel arrangements had 
to be carefully coordinated (2009, 408). These challenges, the researchers realised, 
necessarily excluded many potential disabled visitors from participating in outdoor 
leisure activities. Through their focus groups, the researchers were able to tease out 
the importance and value of outdoor activities to disabled people. For example, they 
discovered that participation in the outdoors contributes to a greater sense of self, as 
it re-enforced their belief that “being disabled did not signal ‘abnormality’ or 
otherness” (2009, 413). By engaging in outdoor recreation, participants felt more 
normalised, even if they encountered barriers along the way. Such conclusions 
would be nearly impossible to reach using quantitative data methods alone, but 
become apparent through in-depth qualitative study. 
 
Such nuanced understandings of disability and accessibility are at the core of my 
research interests. As such, I have designed my study around qualitative data 
gathering and analysis. The main method of gathering this qualitative data is through 
focused ethnography, which I describe below. 

102 
 
5.1.1. Ethnographic Study: Focused Ethnography. 
Ethnography comprises the primary data gathering methodology underlying my 
research. As Hammersley (2018) rightfully points out, ethnography has come to 
mean a wide range of methods and theoretical models. For the purposes of this 
research, ethnography is taken to mean "the study of people in naturally occurring 
settings or 'fields' by means of methods which capture their social meanings and 
ordinary activities, involving the researcher participating directly in the setting (if not 
always the activities) in order to collect data in a systematic manner, but without 
meaning being imposed on them externally" (Brewer 2003, 99). More simply, it is 
participant observation in the participant's natural setting, and extracting meaning 
through these observation-focused practices. Here, my focus is on participant 
observation of visitors with hidden disabilities negotiating a visit to a museum or 
heritage site, and I aim to reveal the barriers they encounter, as well as how the site 
itself can help to dismantle these barriers.  
 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, data for this research have come from two distinct 
sources: the visitor's point of view, and the organisation's point of view. Both offer a 
unique perspective on issues of accessibility. Through a combination of interviews 
and participant observation, visitors with hidden disabilities highlight barriers that a 
nondisabled visitor may not notice. For organisations, using participant observation 
as well as interviews with front of house staff and management, I seek to reveal the 
practical difficulties of implementing these solutions but also whether the desire to 
implement them is even present in the first place. Through ethnographic study of 
both groups, I negotiate the needs of the two groups to find acceptable solutions, as 
well as the general attitude surrounding these changes. As my research reveals, it is 
not a simple matter of increasing physical access, but also of creating more 
welcoming environments in which such changes may be suggested. Practical details 
of my data collection activities are explained below.  
 
Although most ethnographic studies are long-term and take place over a matter of 
years, this is not possible nor needed for my research, as described in more depth 
below in section 5.1.1.1. There is a more recent trend towards what Knoblauch 
(2005) deems “focused ethnography,” which is characterised by shorter yet more 

103 
 
intensive periods of time in the field. Pink and Morgan (2013) expand this idea, 
identifying specific characteristics of focused ethnography: intensity in research 
encounters, a focus on detail, ethnographic-theoretical dialogue, and a reliance on 
audio-visual data. These are precisely the characteristics that define my research 
encounters, placing them firmly in the focused ethnography method of data 
collection.  
5.1.1.1. Intensity in Research Encounters. 
As a trade-off for shorter periods of field work, Knoblauch points out that “focused 
ethnographies are typically data intensive” (2005, 9), a point with which Pink and 
Morgan concur (2013, 12). A researcher spends less time embedding themselves 
into an environment, instead inserting themselves into the thick of action from the 
beginning (Pink and Morgan 2013, 7). By entering the fray in ‘media res’, the 
intensity of the encounters is produced: a researcher comes into the encounter with 
a specific purpose and a specific research agenda. In turn, this insertion method has 
several implications. A researcher must put in a considerable amount of research 
before they enter the field, and they must be selective in the participants and 
encounters they seek out. Also, when gathering data, the researcher must not be 
passive but rather take an active, interventionist role in situations. Here I mean that, 
for example, I did not wait for my participants to organically choose to visit a museum 
and then follow along, but rather I scheduled a museum visit with them to a specific 
site (see section 5.2.1 below). 
5.1.1.2. Acquired Knowledge. 
The acquisition of knowledge on the part of the researcher is key in focused 
ethnography. Both Knoblauch and Wall emphasize that a researcher may not enter 
into the field without any prior knowledge, as they may in traditional ethnography 
(Wall 2015, 6; Knoblauch 2005, 10). The researcher must put in their own amount of 
research and come to the situation with a level of background knowledge that allows 
them to quickly come to terms with the culture that they are studying. Very often, the 
researcher is already a member of the community, and therefore they have not only 
knowledge gleaned from more traditional academic sources, but also embodied 
knowledge that comes from existing in this particular setting (Wall 2015, 6; 
Higginbottom et al. 2013, 7).  

104 
 
 
In my research, my own background offers the needed baseline from which to 
pursue an in-depth, intensive study of heritage accessibility. I have several years of 
experience in heritage and specifically front of house positions in museums. I have 
worked for the York Archaeological Trust since late 2016 and formerly volunteered 
with York Museums Trust. I have an intimate understanding of the culture that 
develops amongst the front of house staff and how, although management at higher 
levels may have high ideals, these ideals can become watered down as practicalities 
set in. It is often the front of house staff members that negotiate between ideals and 
realities, as they are the ones that come into closest contact with the visitors at a 
site. For this reason, I entered my research with a desire to shadow front of house 
staff rather than management-level employees, as it is the front of house staff that 
wields the greatest amount of power in terms of shaping a visitor’s experience, and I 
am intimately acquainted with these processes. As such, I can look closely at actions 
and words that others may overlook or disregard as insignificant. A simple example 
is the “script” that admissions staff use – I know from first-hand experience that 
whilst there is specific information that needs to be communicated to visitors, each 
staff member has a different pattern and style to how they present this information. 
The pattern and style in turn reveals the priorities of the staff member. By examining 
these scripts, I can understand the whether or not they emphasise accessibility.  
 
As well as my experience in heritage and museums, I have extensive knowledge and 
training in accessibility. Both on an academic level and a practical level, I have a 
nuanced understanding of accessibility needs and how they shape both a museum 
visit and a person’s identity. My Master's thesis concerned accessibility guides for 
museums and heritage sites, in which I laid out best practices for creating these 
guides (Fisher 2017). It also gave me an opportunity to dig deep into the effects of 
both positive and negative museum visits as shaped by accessibility needs. The 
interaction between identity and experience is complex, and someone without my 
background may not appreciate how a simple museum visit can have a profound 
effect on someone with a disability, in complex ways. Through my combined 
personal background and research interests, I fulfil this unique role of “both outsider 
and insider,” as Wall describes it (2015, 6), enabling this focused ethnographic 
approach to prove fruitful. 

105 
 
 
Additionally, through the course of this research, I came to identify as disabled. 
Shortly before starting this PhD, I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and OCD 
and was put on medication for them. Because my impairments were hidden and 
seemed less severe than other disabilities, I was hesitant to adopt the label 
“disabled” for fear of upsetting people who were “more” disabled than myself. I did 
not identify as fully nondisabled, but rather somewhere in between. However, in 
interacting with my disabled participants and understanding that although their 
disabilities were hidden and therefore their day-to-day struggles were also often 
hidden, I was not appropriating a term that did not belong to me. I was reclaiming a 
term that deeply ingrained ableist attitudes had taken away from me. Taking 
medication is a way I manage my disability, but I have also come to recognise the 
fact that, even with medication, I am still limited in certain activities when my mental 
illnesses flare up. Interestingly, because I “became” disabled over the course of this 
research, I was “both outsider and insider” (Wall 2015, 6) amongst my disabled 
participants, again proving the focused ethnographic approach useful. 
5.1.1.3. Selective Participants. 
To be a successful “outsider and insider,” a researcher must find participants that 
facilitate sharing of experiences. Higginbottom et al. describe participants in focused 
ethnographies as “informers” (2013, 3–4) because of the role that they perform in 
guiding a researcher through these specific encounters. The participants – or 
informers – already hold key information and experience, often without even realising 
it, and the researcher must draw out this knowledge through their shared 
encounters. This unknowing expertise has two implications: participants must be 
carefully selected prior to entering the field, and a researcher must necessarily use 
more interventionist methods of eliciting data. To the first end, Higginbottom et al. 
(2013, 4) call for “purposive sampling,” or carefully pre-selecting participants for their 
“specific knowledge or experience which is judged to be of interest to the 
investigation”. Likewise, Wall (2015, 4) points out that participants may not know 
each other, but they share a specific cultural perspective that is valuable to the 
research at hand.  
 

106 
 
In the case of my research, this means seeking out people with hidden disabilities as 
participants. Full discussion of my selection criteria is below. It would be of little use 
to me if a participant enjoyed visiting heritage sites but did not have a hidden 
disability. Likewise, organisations that are not committed to increasing their 
accessibility would potentially need to be convinced that they should increase their 
accessibility, which would in turn waste valuable time in the field. By selecting 
participants that already have a level of relevance for, and vested interest in, this 
project, I can gather meaningful data that yield better results in the restricted timeline 
of this research. 
5.1.1.4. Interventionist Methods.  
Not only must a researcher carefully select participants, they also must be more 
intrusive in their means of data gathering. Due to the limited time frame, it is not 
enough to stand back and simply observe, hoping for particular situations to arise. 
As Pink and Morgan (2013, 2) emphasise, focused ethnography “involves intensive 
excursions into their [the participants’] lives, which use more interventional as well as 
observational methods to create contexts through which to delve into questions that 
will reveal what matters to these people in the context of what the researcher is 
seeking to find out”. For a researcher to get the data they need, they must ask 
specific questions or guide participants through specific scenarios, using semi-
structured interviews, performative acts (like miming how to open a door), and similar 
methods. Wall (2015, 13) points out that the high volume of data that has come to 
typify focused ethnography is often because of these methods. Semi-structured 
interviews, a method that I rely heavily on with disabled participants (discussed 
below), are particularly suited to focused ethnography as they focus on particular 
knowledge that the participant shares rather than waiting for that knowledge to 
reveal itself naturally, as would happen in more traditional ethnography.  
 
All of this adds up to a very data heavy, intense research setting. Every interaction 
has a purpose and intention, and every interaction is recorded and analysed as part 
of a data set. When I am in the field, there is no “down time”: everything is active and 
deliberate. Focused ethnography does not suffer from its condensed time scale, as 
many critics often worry, but rather uses that time scale to create energetic, profound 

107 
 
interactions that then inform a researcher and provide deep, detailed data from 
which meaningful conclusions can be reached.  
5.1.1.5. Focus on Detail. 
Because of the shortened time span, researchers must also focus on gathering more 
specific details in a setting rather than on a more general overview. As Knoblauch 
(2005, 2) puts it, in focused ethnography, “instead of social groups or fields, studies 
focus on communicative activities, experiences by communication.” Wall (2015, 3) 
describes this focus as dealing “with a distinct problem in a specific context and ... 
conducted within a sub-cultural group”. I prefer this view of focused ethnography: I 
am addressing a specific problem (accessibility) in a specific context (museums and 
heritage sites) with a specific sub-cultural group (people with hidden disabilities). 
Because I am addressing a specific problem in a constrained amount of time, I must 
enter field work with specific questions in mind. Pink and Morgan (2013, 10) agree, 
saying that “the research questions need to be responded to more firmly”, something 
that Wall also emphasises (2015, 12). To do this, the research questions must be 
clear and precise from the outset. I have discussed the general questions this 
research is asking in Chapter 1, but I also expound upon them below, matching each 
question to a particular setting and including further, appropriate questions.  
5.1.1.6. Ethnographic-Theoretical Dialogue. 
Although I enter the field with specific questions, there must be enough flexibility and 
reflexivity to allow for adaptation as needed. It is this ongoing interaction between 
data collection and analysis that Pink and Morgan (2013, 10) describe as the 
“ethnographic-theoretical dialogue”. Although they are different types of activities, 
data gathering and data analysis are not temporally separate from each other but 
rather continually feed each other. In their example, Morgan was having difficulty 
“seeing” a particular aspect of data she was trying to gather – in this case, 
discussion of occupational safety and health (OSH) knowledge – and Pink 
encouraged her, citing theoretical concepts from media studies, to look at these 
knowledge flows in a different way, that is by acknowledging that OSH knowledge 
was not necessarily discussed in “official” terms but rather through embodied 
knowledge. In other words, Morgan had no examples of her participants speaking 
directly to their knowledge of OSH, but she was able to see this knowledge by how 

108 
 
they had embedded certain OSH-related habits into their routines, such as the use of 
hand gels or latex gloves. This realisation then led to a break-through in how they 
recognised data sets (Pink and Morgan 2013, 11–12). Rather than waiting until all 
the data had been gathered and then trying to account for the gaps in it, Pink and 
Morgan were able to adjust their theoretical lens to immediately and directly address 
an issue with this adjustment before it became a major problem in their data 
analysis. 
 
This interaction between data gathering and analysis has also led to an interesting 
emphasis on practical outcomes of focused ethnographic research. Focused 
ethnographies are particularly popular in health sector studies (e.g., Wall 2015; 
Higginbottom et al. 2013; Pink and Morgan 2013; Higginbottom 2008), and these 
have led to practical changes in the health sector, such as more culturally sensitive 
nursing techniques in the UK (Higginbottom 2008, 96). As Wall (2015, 12) points out, 
“there is a drive for research evidence that can be produced in a timely fashion in 
order to inform policy- and practice-relevant decision making”. Higginbottom et al. 
(2013, 2) even claim that now, “findings are anticipated to have meaningful and 
useful application”. This practicality is especially appealing to me, as I am often 
frustrated with the disconnect between disability studies theory and application. 
Focused ethnography provides an opportunity to not simply highlight a problem, but 
also to potentially enact a solution to this problem.  
5.1.1.7. Reliance on Audio-visual Data. 
As has been mentioned throughout, a shortened time span is a key characteristic of 
focused ethnography. I have already shown the theoretical implications of this time 
span, but there is a practical implication as well: data must be collected quickly (Pink 
and Morgan 2013; Knoblauch 2005). As such, focused ethnography has come to rely 
on audio-visual means of capturing data. As Knoblauch (2005, 9) explains, the 
focused ethnographer still relies on observation, but this observation is supported by 
technologies. The use of tape recorders, video recorders, and cameras has become 
commonplace, as they allow for rapid data collection (Higginbottom et al. 2013, 5). In 
a longer, more traditional ethnographic setting, it may not be possible to audio record 
every encounter, as it would be too time-consuming to transcribe everything or 
indeed even impossible to store audio files in that quantity. This is perhaps why 

109 
 
focused ethnography is so well-suited to digital methods of capturing data: the 
shorter, more intense focus means that the moments that are captured are, as 
discussed above, intentional and deemed important from the outset.  
 
Capturing data digitally also means that they can then later be reviewed multiple 
times. Pink and Morgan (2013, 12) discuss how they see this reviewing of captured 
data as “an ongoing form of re-engagement with the materials and context.” 
Although the actual ethnographic experiences can never be fully recreated, they can 
be revisited through these recordings and re-assessed for deeper meanings. 
Knoblauch also has an interesting point, that digital records allow multiple people to 
view the same encounter after the fact and perhaps interpret it differently (2005, 8). 
Multiple interpretations of a single encounter are still possible with more traditional 
pen-and-paper field notes, but these digitally-captured encounters are seen through 
a more detached lens than personal field notes.  
 
That is not to say that digitally captured data are purely detached. As per Knoblauch 
(2005, 10): 
As many problems as these technologies (and the focus imposed by them) may 
cause (problems which are widely discussed in visual sociology and visual 
anthropology), they do change the character of the data produced: one is no longer 
subject to the "uncurable subjectivity" of field reports but disposes, instead, of a 
substantial degree of intersubjectivity. This does not mean that recorded data are 
more objective; it does, however, allow for outsiders to access the data which are 
less dependent on subjective perspectives than are field-notes.  
 
Recorded data always have an element of subjectivity, as a researcher is required to 
choose what to record and what not to record, what to focus on and what can be 
ignored, but they also allow for a fuller experience to be documented. A researcher 
can then be “in the moment” with their participants, knowing there will be an 
opportunity to review other aspects of an encounter later.  
5.2. Focused Ethnography in this Research. 
Focused ethnography, as demonstrated above, is defined by more than just its 
condensed time frame, although that time frame very often shapes other 

110 
 
characteristics of the research process. I have specific, focused encounters with my 
participants, which are captured using voice recorders and cameras. There are 
specific questions that are answered, and during my observations, I adapt my 
theoretical lens to challenges and opportunities as they arise. All of these aspects 
are explained in further detail below, but focused ethnography has proven itself to 
suit my research objectives and methods. 
 
I collected data from two main groups of participants: visitors with hidden disabilities 
and staff/volunteers from heritage organisations. Although I interacted with both 
groups using focused ethnography, the practical aspects of these ethnographic 
investigations differed between the groups, as did the goals for each investigation. 
These differences in approach and outcomes are explained more fully below. 
5.2.1. Visitors with Hidden Disabilities. 
For visitors with hidden disabilities, it was crucial to understand their embodied 
experience of visiting a museum or heritage site. In order to do this, I followed them 
through the entirety of a journey, from the preplanning stage, to the visit itself, to a 
follow-on reflection on the visit as a whole. Further details for each step are below, 
but all worked together to give me a deeper understanding of how museums and 
heritage sites can inadvertently exclude people with hidden disabilities and also how 
these barriers can be dismantled. 
5.2.1.1. Design. 
The research design for my work with visitors with disabilities relies on a series of 
interactions with participants, including observation and semi-structured interviews in 
a variety of settings that capture the different stages of a museum visit (i.e., pre-visit 
research, site visit, post-visit reflection). Following on from Wall’s suggestion, I enter 
these interactions with specific questions in mind (2015, 12). In each section below 
are a sample of questions; for the full list of questions posed to participants at each 
interview, see Appendix A. 
 
The target sample size for participants was originally twelve total participants as a 
way to ensure multivocality in regards to the disabilities represented. With four 
participants to each site, I believed enough variety between experiences would be 

111 
 
guaranteed, allowing me to find larger themes amongst the data. After putting out a 
call for volunteers (discussed below in 5.2.1.2) and receiving far more interest than I 
expected, I increased the number of participants to fifteen: two for the pilot study, 
one to go to all three case study sites, and twelve who each visit one site, split 
evenly amongst the three sites. The impact of COVID-19 on this research is outlined 
more fully in Chapter 7, but because of the pandemic, I was only able to follow ten 
participants through their full journeys.  
 
Dividing participants this way amongst the sites allowed for a richer data set for me 
to analyse, and also allowed for a variety of disabilities to be sampled. Ideally, more 
participants would visit all three sites and thus be able to more directly compare 
these three sites, but given that the sites are spread across two cities, this would 
have proven logistically difficult. It would also require a large amount of time on the 
part of the participants (at least three days for each of the museums), and I felt it was 
unfair to ask this of all participants. As was discovered, some participants had to 
interrupt their normal activities and block out extra time to recover should their 
symptoms increase after a museum visit. However, because I am interested in 
making direct comparisons between sites, I wanted one participant to visit all three of 
the case study sites. Because of the pandemic, this did not happen. Additionally, two 
people were selected for the pilot study to test out the design of the study in order to 
get feedback on my approach and practice my data collection skills (i.e., think aloud 
protocols, interviewing, participant observation) before commencing with the other 
participants.  
 
The sample size has been kept small to allow for a deeper analysis of people’s 
experiences, something which would be hindered with a larger number of 
participants. Additionally, the number of people with hidden disabilities is large, an 
estimated 14.1 million in the UK alone (Scope 2021), and the variety of impairments 
is wide. No two people have the same needs at the same time, and even for one 
person, their needs may vary from day to day. A person with fibromyalgia may be 
functionally fine in the morning but by the afternoon, a flare up may have them in so 
much pain that they cannot move. Hence, I contend that it is more important for this 
research to look at a smaller number of participants and to comprehensively 
investigate their accessibility needs than to take a larger sample size and only briefly 

112 
 
glimpse at their varied accessibility needs. Indeed, most research regarding disabled 
people has a small sample size for this reason (e.g. Lyu 2017; Wan 2015; 2013; 
Burns et al. 2009). 
 
A small sample size is not without its drawbacks, the most obvious being that it 
necessarily overlooks some disabilities. In such a large population with such a wide 
variety of accessibility needs, even amongst people with the same disability, it would 
be impossible to make a full, comprehensive study of all accessibility needs for 
people with hidden disabilities. To mitigate this, participants have been chosen to 
represent as wide a variety of disabilities as possible. Care has been taken to ensure 
that one particular disability (such as autism or arthritis) does not dominate the data.  
 
Likewise, care has been taken to ensure that the voices of disabled people are 
amplified through this research. I include direct quotes from the interviews with my 
participants where I can, bringing their thoughts and experiences to the forefront. 
Following in the steps of emancipatory research, I draw heavily on the work of Stone 
and Priestley (1996) and Walmsley (2004) in their discussions of the role of the 
nondisabled researcher in disability research. Stone and Priestly, in particular, 
outline a set of guiding principles for nondisabled researchers to follow in order to 
make sure they are not simply enforcing existing power dynamics and therefore 
keeping disabled people disempowered by the very research that is meant to 
highlight their experiences (1996). Although I now consider myself disabled, at the 
beginning of this research, I did not, and I have therefore embedded these principles 
into the methodology. They variously include adoption of the social model of 
disability, emphasising the embodied experience of disabled people, and utilising 
multiple methods of data collection according to the needs of disabled people (709-
10). Of particular interest to me is Stone and Priestly’s (1996, 705) statement that 
“the researcher engages in the process of emancipation, rather than merely 
monitoring them from sympathetic side-lines.” It is not enough for researchers to 
listen and observe, but they must actively use their research to drive tangible change 
for their participants. In my research, this takes the form of presenting suggestions 
and adjustments at my case study sites based on feedback from my participants. To 
that end, an important step in my research is to present these findings to my case 

113 
 
study sites to encourage them to make these changes. I discuss these suggestions 
and the responses from the case study sites in Chapters 8, 9, and 10. 
 
Walmsley (2004) builds on Stone and Priestly’s work to state more explicitly what the 
role of the non-disabled researcher should be. Her specific area of research involves 
people with learning disabilities, which are hidden disabilities and therefore relevant 
to my research. Her position is that it is sometimes harmful for researchers to 
surrender their expertise in the name of emancipatory research, casting themselves 
as mere scribes at the feet of the all-knowing participants (2004, 66). While the 
participants are experts in the everyday implications of living with a disability, the 
researcher is still the expert of the process of doing research, and that should not be 
undervalued (2004, 67). This was a particularly valuable lesson, as during the early 
stages of this research, I found myself often uneasily taking on the role of “expert” as 
I developed the methodology. However, as I progressed further as a researcher, it 
became evident that the particular skills and knowledge that I had acquired and 
cultivated were invaluable to creating a rigorous piece of academic work. For 
instance, in my pilot study, I was able to adapt and reword questions in the middle of 
an interview because I understood the basic point of a particular question. Without 
my academic skill, the experiences of disabled people would remain isolated 
anecdotes that would not necessarily drive any amount of change. It is through the 
partnership of disabled participants and my own expertise as a researcher that these 
barriers to accessibility are examined and that I make attempts to dismantle them. 
 
Having established my rationale, I now turn to describe the specific approaches I 
took to gather data from my participants in four contexts: pre-visit interview, site visit, 
post-visit interview, and follow-up interview. 
5.1.1.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
In this research, data collection begins at the participant's home as this is where a 
visit truly starts. Accordingly, I arrange a first meeting at each participant’s home 
where I reviewed with them how they plan a visit, from internet research (such as 
checking a site's website for relevant information) to transport arrangements to 
planning for what they will take with them on this trip. For many nondisabled people, 
these steps are quick and almost an after-thought; however, this is rarely the case 

114 
 
for a disabled visitor. Like their nondisabled counterparts (Hernández-Méndez et al. 
2015), the vast majority of disabled visitors still use a museum or heritage site’s 
website as their primary source of information (Cock et al. 2018; Euan’s Guide 
2016). However, in addition to basic information like opening times and admission 
prices, disabled visitors also require additional access-related information. 
Wheelchair users, for example, need to know if they can get around a site (Euan’s 
Guide 2016, 4) and blind users want to know if there is information available in 
alternative formats, such as braille or audio guides (Cock 2016, 7). But these 
surveys lean heavily towards people with visible disabilities – does the same hold 
true for visitors with hidden disabilities? 
 
In addition to understanding how they planned for a visit, I also asked my 
participants to explain the impact of their disability on their daily lives to me. In 
imparting their embodied knowledge of disability to me, I was able to better 
understand their perspective throughout our time together. Additionally, I aimed to 
position them as the “expert” in our interactions, balancing the power dynamics 
within our interaction (as per Stone and Priestly 1996). Throughout our interactions 
but especially in this first interview, I emphasised how their knowledge and insight 
constituted the backbone of my research. Mirroring my initial unease as the role of 
“expert” researcher, some participants were initially uneasy with the role of disabled 
expert. I supplied interview questions beforehand, which can be found in Appendix 
A, as a way to ease this discomfort, showing participants that I was interested not in 
technical knowledge, but experiential knowledge.  
 
I specifically sought to answer these questions at the pre-visit interview: 
• 
What information do they need to plan a visit? 
• 
What access tools and websites do they use to gain this information? 
• 
How does their disability impact their daily life? 
 
Interviews were recorded and a transcript was produced, which can be found in 
Appendix C. I also took field notes during these interviews, which can be found in 
Appendix D. Discussion of the data from the pre-visit interviews can be found in 
Chapter 6.  

115 
 
5.2.1.1.2. Site visit. 
The next step was conducting a site visit together. Ideally, I followed participants 
from their front door to the museum, as physically getting to a place is an important 
part of a visit and a lack of appropriate transport can hinder some people from 
visiting in the first place (Euan’s Guide 2016). At the museum, the participant led the 
physical aspect of the visit, guiding where we go within the site, whilst I followed and 
observed their interactions with the exhibits. The "thinking aloud" protocol (see 
below) was employed during the site visit to help participants verbalise their 
experiences and allow me to better collect and interpret their reactions. This protocol 
also alleviated any pressure from the participants to document their visit, which could 
not only take away from the normality of the event and therefore skew the data, but 
also overly complicate things for a participant. An autistic visitor, for example, may 
find it too stimulating to juggle a museum visit, with all its associated sensory inputs, 
and also a checklist to document their experiences. These multiple demands on 
them could not only lead to sensory overload, but also negatively impact the visit, 
which then further embeds a feeling of hesitancy and anxiousness in potential future 
visits (Cock 2016; Euan’s Guide 2016). There are also learning difficulties, such as 
dyslexia, which make it difficult for someone to read and/or write, and giving them yet 
another thing to both read and write about would needlessly complicate their visit 
and also challenge their enjoyment of the visit. As both autism and dyslexia were 
hidden disabilities which I was investigating, I did not want to add any extra stress to 
my participants and therefore decided against administering a participant-written 
survey. It was better that I as the researcher followed them through their site visit, 
prompting them with questions as we proceeded and documenting the experience 
for them. 
 
The Think Aloud protocol was developed specifically to allow researchers to 
understand a participant’s thought process (Fonteyn et al. 1993, 431). Often, 
participants are asked to perform a task and then talk through their actions as they 
make them (e.g., Fonteyn et al. 1993), which then allows a researcher to follow the 
logical progressions of the participant. It is often used in user design evaluations 
(e.g., Joe et al. 2015; Makri et al. 2011; Jaspers et al. 2004), but has found a home 
in museum studies as well. Think Aloud protocol was especially helpful in Achiam et 

116 
 
al.’s (2014) study of visitor interactions with museum exhibits. They had visitors 
interact with particular dioramas within an exhibition, verbalising their thoughts as 
they did so (468). There was no mentally taxing objective to the task, rather the 
researchers simply allowed the visitors to explore the diorama as they naturally 
would but with the addition of thinking aloud. This allowed the researchers to gather 
qualitative data regarding how visitors use these dioramas, what information they are 
seeking, and how they negotiate expectations throughout the interaction (2014, 469-
71).  
 
I base my use of the think aloud protocols on Achiam et al.’s study: I asked my 
participants to verbalise their thoughts as they interacted with particular museums 
and exhibitions. There was no additional mental task, which could lead to sensory 
overload. Prompting took place in simple phrases like “what are you thinking?” or 
“keep going” to keep the participant talking.  
 
To familiarise participants with the think aloud protocol and to lessen any 
awkwardness during the visit, I intended that the participant and I would perform a 
“warm up” exercise utilising cards with illustrations of different food and drink, as 
recommended by Ericsson and Simon (1998, 181). First, I demonstrated thinking 
aloud when dividing up the cards into different piles. For example, I would put cards 
containing pictures of broccoli, carrots, or lettuce in a “vegetable” pile. I would then 
place cards with cheese, milk, or butter in a “dairy” pile, and so on. Then, the 
participant practiced thinking aloud when performing the same task. For example, 
one participant made a pile of carbs, including cards with pasta, cereal, and bread on 
them. Then they made another pile of drinks, which included milk, fizzy soda, and 
water. I encouraged participants to not worry about what piles they created, as the 
point of the exercise was not to show their sorting prowess, but rather to familiarise 
themselves with verbalising their thoughts.  
 
I performed this exercise with three participants, but found that although it did 
encourage participants to verbalise their thoughts and be more at ease in my 
presence, it was equally as effective to engage in casual conversation with my 
participants during the pre-visit interview. With one participant in particular, they 
became distressed as we went through the process, worried that they had 

117 
 
misunderstood the exercise as it felt “too easy.” Therefore, I stopped using this 
particular exercise, instead relying on the rapport I built up with participants through 
our emails and interactions within the initial interview.  
 
I also originally intended to perform an access audit based upon suggestions from 
my participants. By access audit, I mean methodically exploring a site to catalogue 
their accessibility tools, such as level floors, lifts, or Braille guides. However, after my 
pilot study, I dismissed this idea, as I was not interested in an in-depth analysis of a 
site’s accessibility offer, but rather wanted to offer suggestions for improvement. My 
pilot study participants agreed that a cursory examination of the accessibility 
provisions at each case study site would be sufficient, particularly as I wanted to 
understand disabling barriers from the embodied perspective of my participants 
rather than through my own lens.  
 
I specifically sought to answer these questions during the site visit: 
• 
What barriers does the participant encounter?  
• 
How do these barriers affect their visit?  
• 
What things helped their visit? 
 
Site visits were recorded and a transcript was produced, which can be found in 
Appendix C. I also took field notes during these interviews, which can be found in 
Appendix D. Discussion of the data from the pre-visit interviews can be found in 
Chapter 6. 
5.2.1.1.3. Post-visit interview. 
Immediately following the site visit (i.e., on the same day), I conducted a semi-
structured interview with the participant. The focus was on our visit together, but I 
was also open to hearing stories of previous visits to other sites. Hidden disabilities 
vary in severity on a daily basis, and therefore some accessibility needs may not 
have been present for our shared visit, hence my desire to hear stories from other 
visits. It was also possible that a participant had encountered specific barriers during 
other museum visitors that were not present during our visit, but that had a lasting 
impact on the participant.  
 

118 
 
I sought to answer these questions during the post-visit interview: 
• 
What parts of the visit did they find particularly challenging? 
• 
What parts of the visit did they enjoy the most? Why? 
• 
What would they like to tell the museum in regards to accessibility?  
 
This interview was recorded and a transcript produced from it (see Appendix C). As 
this was an opportunity for the participant to recount their personal experiences and 
emotions, this interview had a more conversational, relaxed feeling to encourage 
these personal stories. To aid in creating this mood, the interview took place in a 
café or tea room near the museum – although two of the case study sites 
(Treasurer’s House and Abbey House Museum) have onsite tea rooms, having a 
certain amount of physical distance from the museum allowed for a more reflective, 
open conversation. It also meant that there were no members of museum staff 
present, which might have pressured a participant into only discussing the positive 
aspects of the visit.  
 
The interview was recorded and as such, I was not required to take notes in the 
moment. I therefore could give the participant my undivided attention. Higginbottom 
et al. (2013, 5), in their discussion of interviews in focused ethnography, stress that 
the interview should “be started after an informal opening, to put the participant at 
ease and establish their trust.” As the participant and I had immediately come out of 
a museum visit together, a certain level of ease and trust had already been 
established. But to ensure that this trust and ease carried on, even in the presence 
of a voice recorder, I started each conversation off with general questions regarding 
the visit, such as how the overall visit was, and provided my own answers as well to 
establish this as a fluid, two-way conversation rather than a rigid and one-sided 
interview. I had rehearsed my questions ahead of time so that I was able to smoothly 
interject them into the conversation, rather than making the interview seem like a 
checklist of questions to be answered (see Appendix A for a full list of the 
questions).  
5.2.1.1.4. Follow-up interview. 
Between one and seven days after the site visit and original interview, I conducted a 
follow-up interview with the participant. This semi-structured interview focused more 

119 
 
on other visits, as the participant had more time to reflect on this visit and contrast it 
with other visits they had done in the past, something I prompted them to consider at 
the end of our previous interview. It also helped the participant to highlight aspects of 
our shared visit that since stood out to them as significant and that they may have 
overlooked in our previous interview. Likewise, it gave me an opportunity to ask 
follow-up questions to clarify or supplement observations from the visit and interview 
(e.g., Johnstone et al. 2006, 3).  
 
Research regarding memory creation – and indeed, forgetting as well – shows that 
there is a bump in recollection one and two days after the initial learning period 
(Murre and Dros 2015, 19). Likewise, research also shows that after a week, the 
“forgetting curve” levels off and there is little additional recollection loss (Averell and 
Heathcote 2011, 32). Because of this, I felt that the best period for a follow-up 
interview was between these two points, as it gave the participant enough time to 
sort through all the information they processed during the site visit and to disregard 
the unimportant moments as well as highlighting the important moments of the visit.  
 
I sought to answer these questions in the follow-up interview: 
• 
How specifically does the participant’s disability affect their heritage 
experiences? 
• 
How did our visit together compare to visits to other museums, especially 
free-to-enter museums? 
• 
Do they consider themselves disabled? 
 
Like the previous interview, this interview was audio recorded. While the preference 
was for another face-to-face interview, there was flexibility at this stage for the 
interview to take place over the phone, as occurred with one participant. 
Unfortunately, I was unable to conduct this follow-up interview with one of my 
participants, as they never returned my communications after our visit (see below 
and Chapter 6 for more information on this and other participants).  Appendix C 
contains the transcripts of these interviews, whilst Appendix D contains my field 
notes. Appendix E contains my field diaries, in which I reflect on my interviews and 
site visits with my participants and query themes as I see them arising.

5.2.1.2. Selection of Participants. 
As mentioned previously, careful selection of participants was key to gathering useful 
data. For the pilot study, two participants, Teagan and Kasi, were chosen based on 
my previous knowledge of their disabilities – in their case, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, 
ADHD, and dyslexia. For subsequent participants, calls were put out to various 
disability organisations in Leeds and York, the locations of my case study sites. The 
University of York Disabled Student Network and Leeds Physical and Sensory 
Impairment Network were the primary groups used to recruit potential participants, 
along with the snowball method, where participants were then encouraged to invite 
friends and acquaintances who might be interested in my research. 
 
Initially, over 20 people volunteered to participate in my research, a number that far 
exceeded my expectations. I wrote back to each volunteer, inviting them to explain 
their disability to me, if they were comfortable doing so. Several people never 
responded, meaning that I could not assess whether they would be appropriate as a 
participant for my research. Of those that did respond, I created a table of 
disabilities, dividing responses into three categories: physical disabilities (P), mental 
health conditions (MH), and neurodiversity (N). I developed these three categories to 
describe the wide range of impairments that lead to hidden disabilities. In doing so, I 
was also able to better represent the widest range of hidden disabilities possible 
through the participants in my research. Table 2 shows the breakdown of the 
disabilities the volunteers represented and divided into the three categories. Some 
volunteers are represented anonymously, using a single letter, as they did not 
become participants and therefore did not sign consent forms in order to share their 
identity.

Table 2. Volunteers and their respective disabilities divided into categories. *Impairment was never further 
specified. 
Having created the table, I attempted to select participants that experienced a 
spectrum of hidden disabilities. Amy (Treasurer’s House; anxiety, hypermobility, 
OCD), for example, had a physical disability, a mental health condition, and was 
neurodivergent, making her especially important as a contributor to this research. I 
also attempted to maintain a balance between the three categories to ensure no one 
type of disability dominated my research. Moreover, I tried to not duplicate 

122 
 
disabilities as best I could, although this proved far more difficult, given the pool of 
volunteers and their disabilities.  
 
The participants I initially selected and their disabilities are represented in Table 3 
below, along with the site I intended them to visit. Again, some potential participants 
are represented by a single letter, as I was forced to end my data collection 
prematurely (see Chapter 7), and therefore did not sign consent forms in order for 
me to identify them in my research.

Table 4. Actual participants and their respective disabilities divided into categories. 
A brief discussion of each participant and the impact of their disabilities takes place 
in Chapter 6. 
5.2.1.3. Data Collection. 
Data were collected using several media, depending on the setting and situation. 
Pen and paper notes were utilised, especially during the pre-visit interview. If 

124 
 
necessary, photos (taken on a mobile phone) were used to document the pre-visit 
interview, particularly when participants spoke of the accessibility tools they use in 
their everyday lives. 
 
All interactions were all intended to be audio recorded using a handheld voice 
recorder and subsequently transcribed (see Appendix C). However, some of my 
participants were showing distress as we began our site visit. In these instances, to 
put them more at ease, I decided to not audio record our site visit, and instead took 
more detailed notes and wrote a more thorough field diary after our visit. During site 
visits, like the pre-visit interviews, photos were taken to document the visit but also to 
be used as memory prompts during later conversations (Lin et al. 2016).  
 
For the transcripts of audio recordings, I have employed something called “selective 
transcription,” a method that has been used in a wide variety of settings (e.g., 
Azevedo et al. 2017; Tian and Zilli 2011; Davidson and Australia 2009; Halcomb and 
Davidson 2006). Because of the amount of audio recordings, I have only transcribed 
the parts that are relevant to this research. All audio recordings have been unedited, 
but due to the amount of work involved in transcribing dozens of hours of audio 
recordings, as well as concerns around breaching the privacy of my participants, it 
was most economical to transcribe only relevant conversations. For example, I 
transcribe my interviews with participants in full so long as we are discussing my 
research, our visit to the museum, their disability, etc. However, I have not 
transcribed parts of the interviews where we discuss personal matters, such as 
someone’s dinner choice, or where we were interrupted by non-participants.  
 
During site visits with participants, I have likewise transcribed all relevant 
conversations. As only the participants have signed consent forms, they are the only 
ones identified within the transcripts by name. Due to the nature of a museum visit, it 
was impossible to record only my participant and not any other noise or voices, and 
this was another consideration in my selective transcription. 
 
Audio was recorded on a handheld voice recorder, then uploaded to Otter.ai for 
basic transcription. Each transcript was reviewed to select relevant conversations, 

125 
 
then checked for accuracy and edited as needed. Transcripts can be found in 
Appendix C. 
5.2.1.4. Ethical Considerations. 
Ethics approval was carried out through the University of York. A full ethics form was 
submitted, as required for research with “vulnerable” groups. According to the 
university’s own definition, this included people with learning disabilities. However, 
during the process of submitting this form, it seemed somewhat belittling to classify 
all people with learning disabilities as “vulnerable.” Dyslexia, for example, is a 
neurodivergent condition, often considered a learning disability and affecting a large 
portion of the population, including several of my participants (Kasi, Teagan, Jessica, 
and Alfie). None of these participants had any reduced mental capacity due to their 
learning disability, and indeed, all four hold or are pursuing a Masters degree from 
the University of York. Alfie has since started a PhD at York as well, while Teagan 
plans to pursue a PhD in her own right at a later date. It felt demeaning to describe 
them as vulnerable simply because their brains process letters on a page differently. 
 
The participants were supplied with a copy of the consent form and information sheet 
via email before our first meeting, giving them time to read over both sheets and ask 
questions ahead of time. It also allowed them to use a screen reader or other 
accessibility tool if they wished. A copy of each sheet can be found in Appendix B. At 
the first face-to-face meeting, physical copies were provided to each of the 
participants, once again asking if they had any questions or concerns before they 
signed the sheets and handed them back to me for secure storage. 
5.2.1.5. Data confidentiality and storage. 
As mentioned above, data were captured via audio recording and digitally written 
field notes, as well as supplementary photos. The audio recordings were 
immediately taken off the recording device and stored on a personal, password 
protected laptop, then erased from the device. A backup copy of each recording was 
also uploaded to a password protected Google Drive folder. The field notes were 
written via mobile phone into a private Discord server (an application normally used 
for instant, online communication between people – in this case, I was the only 
member of the server and therefore only I could see the field notes). Discord’s 

126 
 
Privacy Policy prevents the collection of personal data and stores all messages sent 
on their servers in remote host servers. All field notes were deleted from the server 
following the transfer to a Google Doc, wiping it from Discord’s remote host servers, 
then copied to a Google Drive document. This drive document was stored in a 
secure folder that only I and my supervisor could access. 
 
No personal data were gathered aside from that which related to participants’ 
disabilities, and all participants were given the option to use a pseudonym to protect 
their identity. The signed consent forms were kept in a folder inside a locked filing 
cabinet, which was itself located in a locked office with key-card access. 
5.2.2. Organisations. 
For my participant organisations, I wanted to understand the culture of their heritage 
site, particularly attitudes towards accessibility and people with disabilities, as well as 
how easy or difficult it would be for the organisation to act upon suggestions to 
increase accessibility. 
5.2.2.1. Design. 
As discussed above, focused ethnography has been chosen due to time constraints, 
but it also offers the best option for the type of data I wished to gather. At each of the 
sites, I intended to shadow front of house staff members for a period of four-five 
weeks, averaging two-three days a week. As discussed in Chapter 7, the COVID-19 
pandemic significantly altered these plans, but I was still able to experience an 
amount of shadowing at each site, observing interactions as well as conducting 
semi-structured interviews with staff at each site.  
 
Like with my participants, I arrived at each site with particular aspects I wanted to 
study in mind. These aspects included: 
• Language use; 
• Underlying attitudes as teased out by interactions and conversation; 
• Site-specific accessibility tools. 
 
I was also especially interested in observing any interactions staff may have with 
visitors with disabilities. 

127 
 
 
Additionally, I presented the early findings of my research to management-level staff, 
offering the suggestions that my participants gave. In each of these interviews, I 
explained the barriers that participants encountered during our site visits, as well as 
any suggestions they had for improvement. In turn, management staff responded, 
either with how they would implement these suggestions or the barriers they 
themselves had to enacting the accessibility suggestions. I discuss these 
presentations with management staff in Chapter 6, and the questions and comments 
I posed to them are found in Appendix F, along with field notes from our meetings in 
Appendix G. 
5.2.2.2. Sites. 
My case study sites have been carefully chosen based on location, the organisations 
that manage them, and also the fabric of the buildings themselves. All three are 
listed medieval or early modern buildings, meaning that there are additional 
considerations that must be accounted for if any significant physical changes are 
proposed. These additional considerations often make property managers shy away 
from such changes (as discussed in Chapter 3), normally owing to their cost.  
 
My case study sites are as follows: 
• Abbey House Museum in Leeds (run by Leeds City Council); 
• Barley Hall in York (run by York Archaeological Trust); 
• Treasurer’s House in York (run by the National Trust). 
 
Whilst each site is located within a listed building, each organisation represented a 
different kind of management structure. Leeds City Council is a local council, whilst 
National Trust is a national charity and York Archaeological Trust is a local charity 
associated with a commercial archaeology service. I was interested in understanding 
how the different management structures would respond to accessibility suggestions 
and, assuming they accepted these suggestions, how able they were to implement 
them. 
 
As all three case study sites were paid-entry sites, I covered the entrance fees either 
by previous arrangement with site management (Barley Hall, Treasurer’s House) or 

128 
 
by paying for the fee myself (Abbey House). Additionally, consideration was given to 
location of participants’ residents in relation to their particular case study site to 
reduce transportation costs. Refreshments for any meetings were also paid for by 
myself.  
 
This financial consideration was important as a means of minimizing barriers to 
participation in this research. Numerous studies have shown that disabled people 
have far less financial security (Fremstad 2009; Makaroun et al. 2017; Jorgensen et 
al. 2018) and I did not want this research, which aims to highlight barriers to 
participation in heritage, to put unnecessary strain on any potential participants. 
 
For more information on each site, see Chapter 6.  
5.2.2.3. Data Collection. 
Data in relation to the organisations have been collected primarily in the form of field 
notes, especially as notes on my mobile phone. As mobiles have become ubiquitous 
in contemporary society, I felt it was less obtrusive for me to do something on my 
phone rather than making notes on more traditional pen-and-paper (Muskat et al. 
2018). It also helped the staff that I shadow feel more relaxed and less like their 
every word was being scrutinised. Staff self-editing could skew the data and very 
likely not give me an accurate picture of the culture of the organisation. My notes 
were later transferred to a word processing document. 
 
As well as in-field notes, I also made daily diary entries after each session. These 
entries allowed me to reflect on the day’s events and to begin processing any 
important moments that may have occurred. Field notes and diaries can be found in 
Appendix G. 
5.2.2.4. Ethical Considerations. 
As mentioned, ethics approval was carried out through the University of York and 
was included in the original ethics approval for participants. Professional participants, 
as I dubbed them, were provided with an information sheet and a consent form upon 
my first face-to-face meeting with them. I verbally explained my research to them as 

129 
 
well, then asked if they had any questions before they signed the consent form, 
which can be found in Appendix B. 
5.2.2.5. Data confidentiality and storage. 
Data was captured as digitally written field notes and diaries. As with the data 
captured from my participants, all field notes were written via mobile phone into a 
private Discord server, then copied to a Google Drive document. Field diary entries 
were written directly into a Google Drive document. These drive documents were 
stored in a secure folder that only I and my supervisor had access to. 
 
No personal data were gathered from the staff members that I shadowed. Signed 
consent forms were kept in a folder inside a locked filing cabinet that was itself 
located in a locked office with key-card access. 
5.3. Data Analysis. 
In order to unlock the potential of the data gathered, Critical Discourse Analysis was 
employed, as I recognised it as the most appropriate theoretical framework to 
analyse the data. Below is an overview of Critical Discourse Analysis, followed by its 
application in heritage studies and disability studies, respectively. Finally, I explain its 
relevance and appropriateness for this research, as well as a brief account of how 
my analysis proceeded. 
5.3.1. Critical Discourse Analysis. 
Instead of focusing on purely academic or theoretical problems, it starts from 
prevailing social problems, and thereby chooses the perspective of those who suffer 
most, and critically analyses those in power, those who are responsible, and those 
who have the means and the opportunity to solve such problems now (van Dijk 1986, 
4). 
 
The above is how Teun van Dijk describes Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA herein) 
and positions it as different from other linguistic and social theories. At its most basic, 
CDA looks at the language used by those in power to keep others oppressed, then 
offers insights on how to challenge these structures. As a critical linguistic theory, it 
acknowledges that language shapes thought and action (Janks 1997), which in turn 

130 
 
shapes power dynamics. However, it is not enough to simply identify how the 
linguistic structures reinforce inequality. A further step must be taken, wherein 
scholars must actively challenge these dynamics – they must use these insights to 
“challenge power, to subvert it, to alter distributions of power in the short and long 
term” (Wodak 2011, 52-53). The idea of challenging and subverting structural 
inequity perfectly aligns with my own views of research: it is not enough for me to 
show how difficult it is for visitors with hidden disabilities to fully engage at museums 
and heritage sites, I must expose the barriers they encounter and offer concrete 
solutions to dismantling these barriers. Sometimes, this comes through the 
introduction of new accessibility offers at a site. Sometimes, this comes through 
completely rewriting the accessibility policy of an organisation.  
5.3.1.1. CDA and Heritage. 
In the field of heritage, CDA has been used surprisingly little to analyse current 
practices in the field. One significant exception is the work of Waterton et al. (2006), 
who used CDA to analyse the Burra Charter. The Charter is a policy document which 
outlines best practices in Australia heritage management and conservation, and has 
been influential in the creation of similar charters (Qian 2007). By closely reading the 
Charter and applying CDA techniques, they reveal that although subsequent 
additions and amendments to the Charter have aimed to make it more inclusive, “the 
discursive construction of the Burra Charter effectively undermines these 
innovations” (Waterton et al. 2006, 351). For example, the 1999 revisions to the 
Charter sought to incorporate “new ideas” and allow for “the co-existence of cultural 
values, where they conflict” (Australia ICOMOS 2000, 22). However, this aim was 
significantly undermined by the authoritative tone of the entire document. As 
Waterton et al. (2006, 347) put it, “overall, the text reads more as a series of 
categorical statements that signal authority and expertise in an explicitly 
unidirectional flow of information, with a seriously diminished dialogicality of text.” In 
other words, the Charter positions itself as the ultimate authority on heritage and 
conservation, sharing its expertise with less-informed individuals and organisations. 
This necessarily means that any opposition to the Charter’s position or views is 
inherently wrong, or at least ill-informed and therefore can be disregarded. This close 
attention to the language and construction of the Charter shows how difficult it can 
be to enact effective change, despite earnest attempts to do so. Until the language of 

131 
 
the Charter as a whole is transformed, it cannot be the tool for wider inclusion as has 
been the aim of later iterations.  
 
As can be seen from the above example, CDA provides an excellent framework to 
uncover the subtle ways that heritage policy reinforces barriers and exclusionary 
practices, despite claiming to do otherwise. It is hoped that future work will be done 
in this same vein, using CDA techniques to critique and revise current and future 
policies. For now, however, it has proven itself as a valuable resource that provides 
the basis for the analytical work done in this research, as discussed below. 
5.3.1.2. CDA and Disability Studies. 
Perhaps even more surprisingly, there has been little interaction between CDA and 
disability studies. In a field where the ontological implications of “people with 
disabilities” versus “disabled people” have never truly been settled, CDA seems a 
natural fit for such discussions. And yet, only a handful of scholastic articles combine 
the two in any depth. 
 
One such article is an analysis of the disability policy documents used by a 
Norwegian NGO – Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People (FFO 
hereafter) – which represents a wide variety of disability organisations (Grue 2009). 
Grue systematically codes these documents to understand the underlying 
assumptions of disability and accessibility that FFO acts upon. Through this close 
intertextual analysis, he shows that there is no explicit model of disability that the 
organisation espouses, but rather a fluid understanding that disability can be socially 
constructed but also an inherent condition of a person (2009, 306). For example, one 
of the FFO documents reads: “To exclude people with disabilities and chronic 
illnesses by inflicting on them additional expenses which are caused by 
consequences of the disability or chronic illness, is also a form of systematic 
discrimination” (as quoted in Grue 2009, 322). This is a perfect blending of both the 
social model and the medical model of disability. On one hand, the person is being 
disabled by a society that forces additional expenses on them in the management of 
their condition, thus following a social model wherein society is the disabling factor. 
However, it also incorporates a medical model view, in that the disability or chronic 
illness is a property of the individual, and something that must be managed and 

132 
 
accounted for. By orienting disability as something that can be both socially 
constructed and medically inherent, they bridge the gap in what could be (and 
indeed has been, especially within the scholarship) an acrimonious debate. Most 
importantly, it is through CDA that this understanding of disability is elucidated, as 
nowhere it is explicitly stated in FFO’s policy documents. By using CDA techniques, 
a hybrid model of disability can be articulated in ways that have been impossible until 
now.  
5.3.2. CDA and this Research. 
As mentioned above, CDA is a particularly useful theoretical structure for uncovering 
the subtler power dynamics at work in accessibility. It should be noted that CDA is 
particularly relevant for the data that come from my case study organisations, as 
these sites are in a position of power with the ability to enable or deny disabled 
visitors. All my case study organisations have expressed a genuine desire to 
increase their accessibility, but CDA can help to reveal the likely organisational 
commitment to these desires. 
 
In order to undertake this analysis, these sites are in a position and coded different 
interactions between disabling barriers and my participants. Because I engaged in 
focused ethnography, the ethnographic-theoretical dialogue (as per Pink and Morgan 
2013) allowed me to reflect upon emerging trends in the data set and then ask 
further questions of my participants to clarify and solidify – or adjust – these trends.  
 
As my data collection progressed, I returned to this method continually. Initially, I 
was concerned with uncovering the disabling barriers faced by my participants, but 
as I moved into analysing the site organisations themselves, I particularly applied 
CDA to examine the power dynamics involved. These power dynamics are 
discussed more fully in Chapter 8, but suffice to say that I found CDA particularly 
helpful to understand the subtler aspects of disabling barriers. 
 
Additionally, an important aspect of CDA is challenging oppressive power structures, 
which I considered a mandate of my own research too. To that end, I conducted 
interviews with management staff at case study organisations, presenting them with 
the disabling barriers encountered by my participants, as well as their solutions 

133 
 
where appropriate. With permission from my participants, I explained not only what 
these barriers were, but also why they were particularly disabling, allowing 
management staff to better understand the embodied knowledge of my participants. 
Using my position as a doctoral research student, a position which lent me an 
amount of academic authority and credibility, I challenged the organisations on their 
decisions, asking them to explain unintentionally disabling policies and actions and 
guiding them to more inclusive approaches. I outline these interactions in Chapter 6, 
and discuss them further in Chapters 8 and 9. 
5.4. Summary. 
Throughout this chapter, I have outlined the various steps I undertook at each stage 
of my data gathering and analysis. By using the techniques and concepts embedded 
in focused ethnography, I have been able to gather the experiences of people with 
hidden disabilities when visiting a museum or heritage site in their entirety. Through 
a combination of participant observation and semi-structured interviews, I gained 
insight into the barriers they faced as well as potential solutions to dismantle these 
barriers. With my case study sites, I use a combination of participant observation and 
semi-structured interviews, particularly grounded in Critical Discourse Analysis, to 
uncover the systemic hurdles that may prevent meaningful change taking place. 
 
All of this is done with the aim to generate ideas and solutions to disabling barriers 
across the heritage sector. A final, crucial step is to implement some changes at the 
case study sites to determine their feasibility and their efficacy. As highlighted in 
CDA and disability studies more generally, I cannot in good conscience stop at 
merely identifying the problems: I must use my own position and authority to push for 
change where I am able, which I discuss throughout Chapters 8-10. 
 
In the next chapter, I outline the main data that I collected, both from participants and 
from case study organisations, in line with this methodology.

Chapter 6 – Data. 
Having discussed my methodology in the previous chapter, I now turn to the data I 
collected. I have organised it similarly to Chapter 5, dividing this chapter into two 
halves: data from participants and data from organisations. However, I discuss the 
organisation data first, as it is necessary to explain the setting in which my 
participants make their comments. To that end, I describe each case study site, 
including their accessibility offer. I also describe the interviews I conducted with staff 
members, both front of house staff and management staff. I then turn to participant-
centred data, briefly describing each participant, as well as the journey that I took 
with them through each site.  
6.1. Organisation-centred Data. 
In this section, I describe my case study sites and the organisations that manage 
them. I discuss the accessibility offers at each site with particular emphasis on the 
accessibility provisions for visitors with hidden disabilities prior to my research. I also 
describe the interviews I conducted with staff members firstly as I shadowed front of 
house staff members, and then again later when I presented my research findings to 
management staff. I list the case study sites alphabetically, as I was constantly in 
contact with each site throughout my research and there was little chronological 
order to them. 
 
Please note that, in line with the recommendation of the University of York Ethics 
Committee, I have assigned pseudonyms to all staff members. I have also strived to 
keep their job title as vague as possible to avoid revealing their identities and provide 
full anonymity. Additionally, all material contained in this thesis complies with the 
Ethics Committee standards. Staff and volunteers were aware of my presence at all 
times, and I was an active participant in their conversations. At no time did I record 
or take notes on private conversations. 
6.1.1 Abbey House Museum – Leeds City Council. 
Abbey House Museum in Leeds is housed within a Grade II* listed building, originally 
the gatehouse of nearby Kirkstall Abbey. Today, it houses a collection dedicated to 

135 
 
social history and childhood experiences in Victorian-era Leeds (Leeds Museums 
and Galleries 2021d). The ground floor has a recreated Victorian Street that visitors 
can wander through, as well as a free-to-enter café. The first floor has the “gallery of 
childhood” that holds a large collection of Victorian toys and games, explaining the 
everyday life of a child in Victorian times. It also has a soft play area for smaller 
children and a temporary exhibition space. During my visits with my participants, the 
temporary exhibition on view at the time was titled “Danger Zone,” exploring the 
hidden dangers that lurk in common, everyday objects from the past 200 years 
(Leeds Museums and Galleries 2020b). During my shadowing experience, it had 
been replaced with “Sounds of Our City,” an exploration of music styles and their 
development within Leeds (Leeds Museums and Galleries 2021e), although it had an 
almost identical style and format.  
 
Abbey House is managed by Leeds City Council as part of their Leeds Museums & 
Galleries (LMG) portfolio, which includes nine different cultural sites around the city. 
LMG represents the largest local authority-run museum service in the UK, and is 
celebrating its 200th birthday in 2021 (Leeds Museums and Galleries 2021c). I 
specifically chose LMG to understand the multiple levels of approval that proposals 
must be put through in order to enact change. Given the organisational structure of 
LMG, I wanted to understand how the bureaucracy involved in local councils 
impacted accessibility proposals at a site like Abbey House. 
 
According to their website (Leeds Museums and Galleries 2021f), Abbey House 
provides the following accessibility measures: 
• Level entrance from the street; 
• Lift to first floor; 
• Wheelchair available to borrow; 
• Guide and assistance animals welcome, including a water bowl for their use; 
• Accessible parking bays on-site; 
• Accessible toilet; 
• Braille interpretation material; 
• Audio elements; 

136 
 
• Handling sessions and touch tours available upon request (two weeks prior to 
visiting). 
 
On their website, their access provisions are listed by disability categories (Leeds 
Museums and Galleries 2021f), a system that is strongly discouraged as being 
confusing and potentially discriminatory (Fisher 2017). Additionally, none of the 
categories include hidden disabilities. Arguably, many of these accessibility tools can 
be utilised by visitors with hidden disabilities, such as the accessible toilet or the 
wheelchair, but as no hidden disabilities are listed in the category, they imply that 
visitors with hidden disabilities are not necessarily welcome to use these tools.  
6.1.1.1. Data Collection – Front of House. 
I spent one day shadowing front of house staff at Abbey House, although I had 
originally intended to spend at least ten days here. Despite this, my experience 
during that day aligned with the experiences of my participants when we visited 
previously as well as what managerial staff expressed, so I do not believe I failed to 
take account of anything significant. 
 
The front of house staff members I interviewed were: 
• Ian; 
• Ella; 
• Danni; 
• Tim. 
 
When I first arrived at Abbey House in June 2021, I was warmly greeted by two male 
staff members in the admissions/shop area and explained why I was there. They had 
been told to expect me, and invited me to head into the museum while they let the 
duty manager know I was there. Although the two staff members in the 
admissions/shop area knew who I was, the staff members I encountered in the rest 
of the museum did not initially know I was there as a researcher and visitor. I spent 
some time touring the museum as if I was a visitor, reacquainting myself with the site 
after a pandemic-related absence of over a year. I also took this opportunity to see 
how the museum had adjusted to a COVID-19 world, which I discuss in Chapter 7. 
Having already done much of my participant data analysis, I was both pleased and 

137 
 
dismayed to see some of the changes, and made notes in my phone and took 
photos to document these changes and my initial thoughts. 
 
After I toured the museum, I returned back to the admissions/shop area and was 
greeted by the duty manager. He asked if there was anything else that I needed, to 
which I said no, and replied that if I needed anything, to let one of the front of house 
staff members know, and they would either help me themselves or radio him if it 
required his attention. Following that, I interviewed four front of house staff members, 
asking questions that I had developed during my time shadowing at Treasurer’s 
House (for a full list of these questions, see Appendix F). All four staff members were 
incredibly kind and helpful, even excited to participate in my research. They all 
expressed a desire to increase the accessibility of Abbey House, acknowledging that 
physically, there was little they could do to alter anything. However, they were eager 
to hear any suggestions that they could implement, especially once I explained that 
the suggestions I had came from my participants.  
 
While I was shadowing, a visibly disabled visitor, whom I have named Adam for sake 
of ease, arrived. Adam had a learning disability, although I did not inquire as to the 
exact nature, as I was more interested in how the staff members reacted to them. 
Admittedly, the staff members were aware I was observing them, but I did not notice 
any of the staff members treating Adam differently from a nondisabled visitor. They 
greeted Adam with the same enthusiasm and patience with which they had greeted 
all other visitors, addressing Adam directly when answering a question instead of 
Adam’s companion, a practice that is frowned upon but far too common (Nario-
Redmond et al. 2019). I did not follow Adam and their companion through the 
museum, but I did notice them again as they left the museum. Both looked relaxed 
and content, which I interpreted as a positive museum experience.  
6.1.1.2. Data Collection – Management.  
I was in direct contact with a senior management member at Abbey House, Mary. 
We primarily communicated via email, although I was able to arrange an in-person 
meeting with her as well as a virtual meeting with her over Zoom once COVID-19 
became a concern.  
 

138 
 
When I first contacted Mary in March 2018 about including Abbey House as one of 
my case study sites, she was enthusiastic about the arrangement. Her only concern 
was that participants would expect far more than she was able to deliver – in 
particular, she mentioned that they would be unable to install a Changing Places 
toilet, a common request that unfortunately, Abbey House does not have the space 
to accommodate. A Changing Places toilet is seen as the most accessible toilet, as it 
includes hoists and larger changing tables to aid in lifting adults from wheelchairs to 
change their incontinence pads or pants, something that is almost impossible even in 
accessible toilets (Changing Places 2021). However, Changing Places toilets also 
require a larger footprint than other toilets, and buildings such as Abbey House 
simply do not have a suitable space to place such a toilet. Once I had assured her 
that I would inform participants that, although I would pass their suggestions to my 
case study sites, there was no guarantee that these suggestions would be 
implemented, she immediately agreed to take part in my research. 
 
I stayed in contact with Mary through email for the majority of my research, keeping 
her informed of different milestones as I accomplished them, such as when I 
received ethics approval and when I would begin bringing participants to her site. At 
every step, she was encouraging and kind, excited to hear developments as they 
occurred. She also helpfully answered questions I had about the museum itself, 
clarifying the roles and responsibilities of particular staff members as well as 
explaining the thought process behind specific policy decisions.  
 
In July 2021, I connected with Mary again over Zoom to present to her the findings of 
my research. I discuss this meeting more thoroughly in Chapters 8-10, but she 
enthusiastically accepted the suggestions, explaining that they aligned with a lot of 
what they had hoped to accomplish at Abbey House, and noting that with my 
research in hand to show to the Council, they were far more likely to receive 
approval for some of these changes.  
6.1.2. Barley Hall – York Archaeological Trust. 
Barley Hall is a grade II listed medieval house in York city centre (Historic England 
2021a). It was purchased and restored by York Archaeological Trust in the 1980s, 
and now acts as an interactive museum about York in Tudor times. The museum 

139 
 
situates itself as an interpretation of what Barley Hall was like around 1483, when it 
was owned by York goldsmith William Snawsell (The JORVIK Group 2021) – even if 
the name “Barley Hall” is a 20th century invention. Documentary and archaeological 
evidence related directly to the site has been utilised throughout the museum, 
including original medieval elements, such as timbers, where possible (York 
Archaeological Trust 2011, 12). On the ground floor, each room has been designed 
to represent its use during the 15th century, such as a steward’s room, a Great Hall, 
and a pantry. Replica objects are placed where they would naturally have been, such 
as cups and bowls on tables in the Great Hall. This not only enhances the “authentic” 
feel of the museum, but also encourages visitors to interact with the items, creating a 
more immersive environment. Additionally, a temporary exhibition called “Magic and 
Mystery,” examining the intersection of magic, religion, and science in the medieval 
mindset, was in place during not only my participant visits but also my ethnographic 
observations.  
 
YAT was founded in 1976 as an independent charity with the aim of investigating 
“the past for the benefit of present communities and future generations” (York 
Archaeological Trust 2021). It is headed by a Board of Trustees and has two main 
branches: the commercial archaeology branch (York Archaeology) and the 
attractions and events branch (the JORVIK Group). In 2019, when my research 
began, the JORVIK Group operated five attractions: the JORVIK Viking Centre, DIG, 
the Richard III Experience, the Henry VII Experience, and Barley Hall. Unfortunately, 
due to COVID-19, the Richard III Experience and the Henry VII Experience were 
closed with plans to re-open them in some form in the future; however, neither have 
fully re-opened as of the writing of this thesis. I chose YAT to understand the 
complexities of a local charity that does not have a steady source of external income 
and instead relies on grants and income from admissions at their attractions.  
 
It should be noted that during the course of my research, I was employed by YAT 
and sat on the Access Team for the JORVIK Group. I produced the accessibility 
guides for all attractions, including Barley Hall, since best practice for accessibility 
guides was the subject of my Master’s dissertation (Fisher 2017). I was primarily 
based at DIG, although I did work occasional shifts at Barley Hall before 
commencing my research. My pre-existing link to both Barley Hall and YAT had the 

140 
 
potential to colour my perceptions of this particular case study site, as I could either 
be too lenient or too harsh in my analysis. However, I put several measures into 
place before beginning my research to ensure I maintained a level of detachment: I 
was not given shifts at Barley Hall, nor did I intentionally interact with Barley Hall staff 
members, both front of house and management, in a professional capacity. Although 
some of the staff members I interviewed were well acquainted with me, we 
maintained the same level of professionalism that I experienced with the other case 
study organisations.  
 
Additionally, my experience working for YAT meant that I had a way of embedding 
myself into other organisations more easily. I could offer my own experiences as a 
front of house or management staff member, encouraging my interviewees to share 
their own experiences in turn. As with all interactions, I was careful to ensure that 
whatever comments I shared were delivered in a fashion that was as neutral as 
possible so a staff member would not self-edit their own experiences but rather 
explain their own embodied knowledge of their site. Ultimately, I found that sharing 
my experiences engendered an automatic level of trust in most of my interviewees, 
enabling me to act as “both outsider and insider” (as per Wall 2015, discussed in 
Chapter 5).  
 
Barley Hall is rather notorious amongst staff for its lack of physical access, as there 
is no lift, no level access to the site, and no level access within the building itself, 
with raised thresholds impeding access in many areas, shown in Figure 4. 

141 
 
 
Figure 4. Tall thresholds in the doorways to each room prohibit level access throughout Barley Hall. 
According to their website (The JORVIK Group 2021a), Barley Hall provides the 
following accessibility measures: 
• Braille and large print guides; 
• Foreign language guides; 
• Guide and assistance animals welcome, including a water bowl for their use; 
• Automatic subtitles on videos; 
• Seating available throughout the museum; 
• “Traffic light” sticker system, signalling a visitor’s preferred level of 
engagement from staff members; 
• Sensory packs; 
• Portable ramps for thresholds; 
• Visual stories. 
 

142 
 
Although not advertised as an accessibility measure, Barley Hall offers multi-sensory 
interpretation. Alongside traditional text panels are tactile and aromatic aspects, such 
as samples of flowers and herbs for visitors to touch and smell. This multi-sensory 
approach to museum interpretation, often lauded as best practice in general (Levent 
and Pascual-Leone 2014), is particularly appropriate for people with disabilities – no 
one sense is primarily used, which would then put someone at a disadvantage if that 
particular sense is impaired (Davidson et al. 1991).  
6.1.2.1. Data Collection – Front of House.  
As with Abbey House, I was not able to shadow as many days as I had originally 
intended. Again, like Abbey House, I spent one day shadowing front of house staff 
and again, my experience that day only complemented what I had seen during visits 
with my participants. I interviewed two staff members during my time there.  
 
The front of house staff members I interviewed were: 
• George; 
• Gwen. 
 
In July 2021, I arrived at a much-changed Barley Hall. The changes are detailed in 
Chapter 6, but to summarise in brief: the layout of the museum had been altered, the 
number of staff members had increased, interactive elements had been removed, 
and maps of the site had been introduced. Because the experience itself had 
changed from what my participants experienced, I focused solely on the staff 
experience in my interviews and observations. 
 
I stationed myself near the admissions desk to interview George and Gwen, the two 
front of house staff members working that day. During my interviews, there were 
numerous interruptions so that they could attend to visitors, something I gladly 
stepped aside to watch. Although no visibly disabled visitors attended on the day I 
was there, both George and Gwen shared stories with me about their interactions 
with disabled visitors. George admitted that he did not have many shifts at Barley 
Hall prior to COVID-19, as he usually worked at one of the attractions that has since 
closed. Gwen, on the other hand, preferred Barley Hall to all the other attractions 
within the JORVIK Group. 

143 
 
 
We were also joined multiple times throughout the day by one of two managers. 
They did not linger or hover, as they were performing their “checks” – an hourly walk-
around of the site to check the toilets and ensure there was nothing amiss in the 
museum. However, both managers stopped and chatted genially with the front of 
house staff members, asking how they were or if they needed a break and also if 
everything was fine in the museum itself. Despite how brief these encounters were, 
there was clearly a good rapport between the managers and front of house as well 
as a sense of respect in each other’s abilities. Gwen confirmed this, saying “it’s nice 
that they trust us to get on with the job” (Appendix G 2.1). 
6.1.2.2. Data Collection – Management. 
My main contact in the organisation was Maggie, a senior manager for the JORVIK 
Group. She also sits on the Access Committee and we had worked together 
previously on other accessibility-related projects, as I mention in 6.1.2. above. We 
communicated primarily through email, and I was able to conduct a face-to-face 
interview with her in July 2021 to present my research to her. 
 
During our interview, Maggie was very excited to hear the suggestions of my 
participants. Particularly regarding the new map, she said that there was debate 
amongst the senior management team as to whether they should continue to offer it, 
but with the support of my research, she was confident she could convince the team 
to keep the maps, along with the adjustments that Teagan suggested (see below in 
6.2.10). She agreed that the lighting at Barley Hall was a problem, as expressed by 
multiple participants (e.g., see Chapter 8) and they had been searching for a suitable 
solution for some time now. She also quite liked Amanda’s suggestion for rope holds 
in the doorways to help people over the thresholds (see 6.2.4.2 below). She 
indicated she would speak to the technical team, who is in charge of many practical 
matters at the sites, and see if they had a solution. 
 
Given her position within the management structure of the JORVIK Group and on the 
Access Committee, she had the ability to implement larger accessibility suggestions, 
such as the personal interpretation boards. Indeed, she made a note to speak to 

144 
 
members of the interpretation team and the head of travelling exhibitions about 
incorporating these boards into all exhibitions with the JORVIK Group.  
6.1.3. Treasurer’s House – National Trust.  
Treasurer’s House is a Grade I listed (Historic England 2021b), although its 
architectural history is complex. A 17th century rebuild of a 16th century house, a 
considerable renovation of the building in the late 19th century brought the house 
into the space it inhabits today. In 1930, Frank Green, the last owner of the with 
house, gifted the property to the National Trust with the promise they would maintain 
the house in the way he had styled it (National Trust 2021d). To this day, the Trust 
still preserves the house as Green left it, down to the brass tacks he installed to 
make sure that his furniture was not moved around  
 
Founded in 1895, the National Trust is well-known as a national charity that owns 
and manages a wide variety of properties, from castles and historic houses to nature 
reserves and gardens (National Trust 2021e). Headed by a Board of Trustees, the 
National Trust has a policy of “for ever, for everyone” that guides all their 
management and conservation decisions. I chose National Trust in order to examine 
an organisation that embodies both a local authority council and a local charity: 
although National Trust is far from local, they have an organisational structure that is 
similar to a council yet they must also work within the financial constraints of a 
charity, with no external income streams.  
 
Interestingly, during the course of my research, National Trust changed their policy 
to “for everyone, for ever” (National Trust 2021e), reflecting a greater emphasis on 
visitors rather than the collection. I discuss the implications of this change in Chapter 
10. 
 
Like Barley Hall, Treasurer's House acknowledges that the physical access of the 
site is not ideal, as it includes many stairs throughout the building but no lift or 
ramps. However, according to their website (National Trust 2021b), Treasurer's 
House provides the following accessibility measures: 
• Guide and assistance animals welcome, including a water bowl for their use; 

145 
 
• Large print, hard of hearing, and non-accessible route transcripts of the 
guided tour; 
• Accessible toilet; 
• Seating available throughout the property; 
• Induction hearing loop. 
 
Unlike Abbey House and Barley Hall, Treasurer's House does not list these 
measures by disability category, but rather by where these accessibility measures 
are located, as is considered best practice (Fisher 2017). Treasurer's House also 
lists additional information, such as door widths and number of steps in a flight of 
stairs. The addition of these details allows visitors to decide whether an area is 
suitably accessible for them, which is also considered best practice and is 
particularly helpful for people with hidden disabilities who may experience uneven 
impairments throughout their day (2017, 85). 
6.1.3.1. Data Collection – Front of House. 
Unlike Abbey House and Barley Hall, I was able to spend five days shadowing front 
of house staff at Treasurer's House. I had originally intended to spend an additional 
five days shadowing after they reopened following their usual winter closure, but the 
COVID-19 pandemic occurred during that closure, forcing me to alter those plans. 
However, as with Abbey House and Barley Hall, the time I spent shadowing 
complemented what I had seen during my visits with participants. I was able to 
interview five front of house staff members and observe two volunteer room guides 
during my time at Treasurer's House.  
 
The front of house staff members I interviewed were: 
• Thomas; 
• Jamie; 
• Jay; 
• Issy; 
• Lee; 
 
Additionally, the volunteers I interviewed were: 
• Sophie; 

146 
 
• Caitlin; 
• Michael; 
• Carly. 
 
I began my shadowing experience in December 2019 with Christmas at Treasurer's 
House in full swing. Staff were allowed to wear Christmas jumpers, something they 
whole-heartedly embraced. The property was decorated for the season, with 
wrapped boxes and decorated trees in nearly every room. The decorations had been 
a point of contention amongst my participants – a long garland of greenery was 
wrapped around the banister of the main staircase. As will be discussed Chapter 10, 
this simple decoration had a lasting impact on many visitors.  
 
There were also some complaints from staff members about the ticketing system for 
Santa’s Grotto, a meet-and-greet with Santa event that is popular every winter 
season at the property. Repeatedly, they challenged their inability to adjust bookings 
on the day, particularly when visitors did not show -up for their time slot. Indeed, all 
tickets had to be pre-booked at least a day in advance, an uncommon requirement 
for Treasurer's House before COVID-19. There was a sense that the front of house 
staff had been disempowered, that they were no longer trusted to do their job. 
Multiple times, they had to turn away disappointed children, parents, and 
grandparents, saying they could not sell any tickets, despite knowing there were 
spaces available. Amongst themselves, they discussed their frustration over the 
procedure, but when I questioned if they had spoken to their managers about this, 
seeking clarity on this policy or asking for adjustments to it, the general consensus 
was that there was no point in asking. “It took us months of asking to even get a 
desk lamp so we could see what we were doing,” one front of house staff member 
commented. 
 
Indeed, the lighting is something that I had noticed almost immediately about the 
reception area. I was shadowing during the winter season, when daylight is scarce in 
Northern England, and Treasurer's House had proven to have low lighting levels 
according to my participants. In the reception area, these low lighting levels were 
particularly apparent, especially as its location meant it had little natural light. Due to 

147 
 
conservation concerns, ecological policies, and even National Trust’s promise to 
Frank Green to not change anything, Treasurer's House insisted that any electric 
lighting needed to be subdued. However, in a room where employees were required 
to read and write as a significant part of their job, I was taken aback at the fact a 
simple desk lamp, one that could be set aside and nearly hidden on the desk, had 
been so controversial with management.  
 
Despite these grievances, front of house staff clearly enjoyed their job and their co-
workers. There was a great sense of friendliness between reception staff, and they 
quickly welcomed me into the fold. Several times, when there were no visitors in the 
reception area, they updated each other on their personal lives and were clearly at 
ease in one another’s presence. I asked them if they spent time together outside of 
work, and several staff members said they did not, as many (if not most) of them 
worked a second job and thus had limited free time. However, many of them 
expressed interest in participating in more “team building” exercises, as they did 
enjoy each other’s company.  
 
It became clear, however, that this friendliness did not extend across everyone within 
Treasurer's House. There were no apparent rivalries between any particular groups, 
but it was obvious that there were multiple groups of employees, and each kept to 
their own group. Amongst the paid staff, groups included the reception staff, the 
café/shop staff, and the management staff. Only once did I see any interaction 
between these three groups, when a manager was at the reception desk waiting for 
one of the National Trust’s staff photographers. She spoke genially with the 
reception staff, but as soon as the photographer arrived, she left and was not seen 
again that day. I never saw any interaction between reception staff and café/shop 
staff, although this may be partly due to the locations of each area.  
 
Even amongst the volunteers, there were strong divisions between groups. One 
volunteer commented that groups were based on which day a volunteer was on site. 
Within these groups, there were strong friendships, and these volunteers did spend 
time together outside of their Treasurer's House shifts, but it could be difficult to “get 
in” the group as an outsider. Again, this is only one volunteer’s perspective, but a 
front of house staff member did comment that they did not recognise all volunteers 

148 
 
when they arrived for a shift, and relied on the volunteer’s apparent level of comfort 
at the property to determine if they should be allowed into the volunteers’ break 
room. Security concerns aside, it is clear that there is little if any contact between 
different groups at Treasurer's House. 
 
Despite these internal conflicts, it was abundantly clear to me that front of house staff 
at Treasurer's House were committed to providing the best possible experience for 
visitors, particularly disabled visitors. All five staff members I interviewed were well-
versed in the site’s accessibility (and its weaknesses) and were eager to share 
stories of their interactions with visibly disabled visitors. During my time onsite, I 
observed them interacting with several disable visitors, including visitors with mobility 
difficulties and visitors with learning difficulties. In all these interactions, they showed 
the same professionalism and enthusiasm that they showed to all other visitors, 
making sure to highlight potential barriers (such as number of steps in a staircase) 
as well as potential aids (such as seating in each room). Additionally, when I arrived 
for my second day of shadowing, both reception staff excitedly told me about a 
visitor who had a guide dog that had been on site the day before. Their enthusiasm 
for and knowledge of accessibility greatly impressed me. 
6.1.3.2. Data Collection – Management. 
My primary contacts at Treasurer's House were and Diane, both senior management 
staff directly responsible for Treasurer’s House. Most of our communication was 
done via email, but I did conduct an interview with Ellen when I had concluded the 
site visits with my participants. In addition to the emerging trends I had noticed by 
that point in my research, there were site-specific aspects of my research that I 
shared with her. A fuller discussion of these barriers is included in Chapters 8-10, but 
at this meeting, I pointed out in particular the low light levels, the lack of seating 
around the property, and the banister issue I mentioned above in 6.1.3.1. I also 
provided her with a list of these points prior to our meeting so that she could prepare 
her responses. During our interview, she expressed very little surprise that the light 
and the seats were mentioned, saying that these have been ongoing complaints. 
However, she offered no alternatives for them, citing guidelines for textile 
conservation as a reason for the low light levels and also pointed out that there is 
seating available within each room, although participants specifically said that they 

149 
 
could not differentiate between chairs they could sit in and chairs they could not. She 
also clarified some confusion that I had regarding the training that staff and 
volunteers receive as part of their induction, as well as the general structure of 
management within Treasurer's House. Ellen also shared with me some future plans 
for the property, including the introduction of a pamphlet which would include a map 
of the property and tablets for room guides that contained additional images and 
information to show to visitors.  
 
I communicated with Diane solely through email, where she was mostly arranging 
the logistics of my visits and also introducing me to relevant staff members at 
Treasurer's House. Both Ellen and Diane were eager to implement any suggestions 
that they were able to, so long as it did not go against National Trust policies or if 
they needed to be approved by regional or national managers.  
 
Additionally, I did conduct a brief interview with Alice, the Volunteers Manager at 
Treasurer's House. I queried her regarding the garland on the banister, and she 
confirmed that it had been changed. A room guide had noticed a visitor having 
difficulty navigating the stairs because of the garland, so the room guide passed the 
observation along to Alice, who corrected the placement. Interestingly, she also 
revealed that in the original design of the decorations, the garland was supposed to 
hang specifically so that it did not interfere with visitors’ ability to use the banister. 
However, this intention was not communicated clearly to the volunteers who installed 
the decorations, hence the problem with the garland.  
 
Unfortunately, I was unable to contact anyone at Treasurer's House after COVID-19 
and therefore have not been able to present my research to the management staff at 
the property. However, Dr Heather Smith, Equity Officer for National Trust, sat on my 
Thesis Advisory Panel and, through personal conversations, I was able to ask her for 
clarification about the management structure of National Trust, amongst other things 
(see Appendix F for full list). I have shared my research with her and although she 
could not attest to any changes that would be made specifically at Treasurer's 
House, there was interest in embedding some of the points in Chapters 8-10 across 
National Trust as a whole.

6.2. Participant-centred Data. 
In this section, I describe my participants and their disabilities. I also provide 
narrations of our interactions as outlined in Chapter 5 with particular emphasis on the 
disabling barriers they encounter. I list the pilot study participants first, as their input 
greatly influenced the structure and nature of my research. After that, I list 
participants alphabetically rather than chronologically, as I was often scheduling 
several participants within one week. I describe their disabilities, using quotes from 
participants themselves. I also detail our interviews and site visit, as outlined in 
Chapter 5, and utilise quotes from participants and details from my own field notes 
and field diaries. Transcripts of these interviews can be found in Appendix C whilst 
my field notes can be found in Appendix D and my field diaries in Appendix E. 
A note on format. 
In Chapter 1 and throughout the rest of the thesis, I utilise a narrative approach to 
the data, as I deemed it the most appropriate way to explore the words, actions, and 
nuances of each interaction rather than a flat presentation of facts. Vignettes are a 
widely recognised tool in ethnographic studies as a means to convey the intricacies 
of an interpersonal moment. Although they are constructed as narratives, they are 
based on field notes and transcripts (Jacobsen 2014, 38) to provide a level of 
authenticity. The details that are added by the ethnographer are meant to bring a 
reader into the moment, to experience the interaction as the ethnographer did 
(Humphreys 2005, 842). Vignettes offer a perspective that other methods of writing 
do not offer, and when trying to explain the experience of disabled people, I find 
vignettes incredibly impactful. 
 
Vignettes have been used to great effect in studies with disabled people. For 
example, Winder-Patel et al. (2021) studied levels of anxiety in autistic children. 
Their research necessitated a flexible approach to how they conducted interviews, 
and they present their data collection process in a series of vignettes (2021, 8-11). 
The vignettes allow the authors to describe not only the words and actions of their 
participants, but also to explore the cause of these behaviours. For example, they 
write (2021, 8):  

151 
 
When Kylo was around people, he would talk repetitively to his parents in a 
pressured way about his favourite food, which was French fries, even if he had just 
eaten. He appeared comforted by thinking about this preferred food like another child 
might be comforted by a favourite object, such as a blanket. 
The added context, detail, and intuitiveness of the vignette more fully describes 
Kylo's behaviour. Merely explaining that he repeatedly talked about French fries 
would not provide a full picture of the encounter. Likewise, I believe that the 
additional narrative elements of vignettes provide a fuller glimpse into what my 
participants experience in each vignette. 
 
To that end, in Chapters 8-10, I open sections with a “vignette” – a short, descriptive 
narration of a particular interaction that I witnessed during my data collection. 
Although I add in my own impressions of emotions and thought-processes, I sent 
drafts of these vignettes to the appropriate participants to obtain their approval, 
ensuring they agreed with my interpretation of events. Likewise, I sent copies of this 
data chapter to participants for their feedback, and it has been included in this thesis 
with their approval.  
 
These vignettes, like the one at the beginning of Chapter 1, are set apart from the 
rest of the text by using a different font and indenting the entire vignette. A horizontal 
line is also placed to connote the beginning and end of a vignette, likewise to 
differentiate the vignette from the rest of the text.  
 
Additionally, when I refer to a participant, I periodically include the site they visited 
and their disabilities to remind the reader of each participant’s experience. This 
follows my use of the human rights model of disability – whilst the barriers that they 
face during their museum experience are constructed by society, they still 
experience physical symptoms due to their conditions. It is very often these 
symptoms that lead to their needs, and a reminder of their conditions is important to 
understanding the participant’s experience. 
 
In designing this research, it was necessary to follow a ‘deficits model’ of disability 
and particularly neurodiversity. In describing their disabilities, my participants very 
often provided ways in which they were limited in their day-to-day activities due to 

152 
 
these disabilities. As such, my focus during our interviews and site visits was on the 
barriers that they faced due to their disabilities and thus how they were limited in 
their interaction with the sites. 
 
It is perhaps an oversight on my part, that in designing research to examine these 
barriers, I did not also take time to examine ways in which my participants' 
disabilities allow them to understand these exhibitions and sites through a different 
lens. It would be fascinating for future researchers to look into this particular line of 
inquiry. I also did not consider barriers affecting potential strengths from these 
disabilities - for example, with their anxiety, both Amy and Lisa prefer to pre-plan as 
much of their trips as possible, which means they are highly organised and detail-
oriented. I did not examine how much they could or could not pre-plan our visits 
ahead of time, nor what that impact had on their enjoyment of the visit. Again, it 
would be interesting for future researchers to take up this view of accessibility and 
examine how constricting people’s strength perhaps disables them. 
 
Initially, there were concerns regarding the anonymity of my disabled participants. 
On their ethics permission form, there was a space for them to fill in how they wished 
to be identified within the thesis. Overwhelmingly, participants used their real name. 
When it was suggested that I should add a level of anonymity to their identities, this 
did not sit well with me. Above all, I wished to follow the lead of my disabled 
participants, so I contacted each of them individually to understand their views on the 
matter. No one had any objections to using the name that they initially identified with, 
and so I have kept their names unchanged in this thesis. For a full list of their 
responses, please see Appendix H.  
 
Additionally, as part of the ethics permission form that participants signed before 
taking part in the research, there was a section at the end regarding how to withdraw 
their consent should they want to in the future. Participants were given both physical 
and digital copies of these forms, and they have my contact details should they wish 
to change their involvement in any way, including withdrawing fully or merely 
changing how they are identified in the thesis. 
 

153 
 
I include citations after quotes from my participants as well, referring to Appendices 
C and D where I have included interview transcripts and field notes.  
6.2.1. Pilot Study – Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS) and Kasi (Abbey House; 
ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, EDS).  
Teagan and Kasi are sisters whom I have been friends with prior to my research. 
From the beginning, both had been open about their disabilities with me, and 
therefore I asked them to participate in my pilot study, supporting me in shaping the 
foundations of this research. In addition to their level of comfort, as someone with 
anxiety, I needed a similar level of comfort as I came to grips with my role as 
researcher. The pilot study took place in May 2019. 
6.2.1.1. Disabilities. 
“You can do something as simple as taking a step like I did today, and I 
sublaxed my knee. And my kneecaps are currently in the incorrect place, and 
there's something underneath, which makes it feel very strange.” – Teagan on 
her EDS (Appendix C 8.1).  
 
“It’s all a processing thing. Whether it comes to writing something down, 
reading something, or just that first comprehension of a word can be pretty 
hard…. It can be hard for me to understand what it is I’m writing, especially if I 
don’t hear it verbally. I can read a paragraph and nothing has been retained, 
which is irritating, and it can be hard with understanding how things are 
pronounced. Drawer. I did not realise it was spelled draw-er. I realised that a 
few months ago.” – Kasi on her dyslexia (Appendix C 8.1). 
 
Teagan’s disabilities include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS herein) and dyslexia. 
EDS is a physical condition where a person’s body lacks connective tissue, leading 
to hypermobility and associated physical difficulties (NHS 2021g). She explained it to 
me this way (Appendix C 8.1):  
My body does not correctly create collagen, so it can affect every connectivity tissue 
– connection in your body, from eyes, joints, digestion issues, hearts and everything 
like that. The specific type that we have is the hypermobility type. Of the different 
types, it tends to be the most benign, but it can also cause a lot of issues. One of the 

154 
 
problems with it is that just because you're feeling good one day doesn't mean that 
you will continue to feel good the entire day or tomorrow, regardless of what you're 
doing… So in addition to that, with me, it means it also affects my digestion, so I 
cannot eat red meat. 
 
Dyslexia is a neurodivergent condition in which a person’s brain interprets letters 
differently, either when reading or when writing, making it difficult to engage with 
textual information (NHS 2021f). As Kasi put it, “I just lose letters. Okay, and I have 
mixed stuff up. I have also mixed up numbers for letters. Fours and Rs, of course, for 
some reason. Okay. Gs and sixes” (Appendix C 8.1). But dyslexia also affects 
handwriting, with Teagan calling her own handwriting “unfortunate” (Appendix C 8.1). 
 
Both EDS and dyslexia have a heredity aspect to them, meaning that although these 
conditions can spontaneously occur in someone, they tend to be genetically passed 
down through a family line (NHS 2021g, 2021f). Indeed, Kasi too has EDS and 
dyslexia, although she also has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) and dyspraxia. ADHD is a neurodivergent condition in which a 
person is unable to focus for long periods of time. Often, they have difficulty 
concentrating and appear restless (NHS 2021b), and Kasi explained (Appendix C 
8.1):  
It's mostly just a focusing problem, I struggle. Even If I'm really engaged in a 
conversation, I can get distracted. I can end up spacing off, I have been to a lot. And 
It's very annoying, especially if it's during class. And I'm like, “Hi. We're having a test 
review.” A few minutes later, “class is over? Oh, okay.” 
 
Dyspraxia is another neurodiverse condition that affects a person’s coordination 
(NHS 2021e). For Kasi, it makes her exceptionally clumsy. She told me (Appendix C 
8.1): 
I also have a tendency to... I will look at something. And If I'm walking, I have no 
awareness of where I'm walking, I got lost in Alaska that way. Also run into things 
that way. And fall when I trip over. 
Indeed, when we visited Abbey House, she held onto Teagan’s arm as we walked, 
shown in Figure 5 below. 
 

155 
 
 
Figure 5. Kasi holds Teagan’s arm as they walk along the pavement. 
In addition to their long-term disabilities, Teagan had a temporary accessibility need 
in the form of an infant in a pushchair. It is an often-overlooked subject in disability 
and accessibility studies that some people have temporary accessibility needs that 
can be completely unrelated to disabilities and impairments. For example, pregnant 
people and those with very small children have access needs that crossover with 
wheelchair users and other people with mobility impairments (Lacey 2004, 21). 
Combined with Teagan’s mobility issues and Kasi’s coordination problems, the 
pushchair presented another level of difficulty in their visit to Abbey House. 
6.2.1.2. Data Collection. 
In June 2019, I met Teagan and Kasi at their home for our pre-visit interview. We 
discussed their disabilities, particularly how, although they have mostly the same 
disabilities, Teagan has more severe EDS whilst Kasi has more severe dyslexia and 
associated neurodivergent conditions. Teagan guided me through how she plans a 
museum trip, showing me the websites she uses (normally the museum’s website) 
and expressed her frustration at not being able to find all the information she would 

156 
 
like. In particular, she wanted a floor plan or map of the museum, so that she could 
pre-plan their route through the museum. When asked, she explained that she 
needed to prioritise which areas they wanted to see, in case she ran out of energy 
during their visit. Kasi insisted that she did not pre-plan her museum visits, saying “I 
leave that to [Teagan],” citing her ADHD as a hindrance to any attempt to plan a visit 
(Appendix C 8.1). Indeed, by the end of our interview, which lasted about an hour 
thanks to a few infant-related interruptions, Kasi was struggling to maintain focus, 
another sign of her ADHD.  
 
Two days later, we travelled together to Abbey House for our site visit. We travelled 
by bus and train, modes of public transportation with which both women were 
familiar and comfortable. Unfortunately, there were some difficulties in our journey, 
such as the lift at York train station being unavailable and causing us to miss our first 
train. Although we were able to catch a later train, this disturbance highlighted the 
importance of understanding the whole of a visitor’s journey – although we were able 
to navigate the stairs even with a pushchair, not all disabled people would be able to, 
thus ending their visit before they ever came close to the museum itself. 
 
Eventually, we made it to Leeds and spent about three hours at Abbey House, the 
majority of our time focused on the site’s Victorian Street and exploration of each of 
the shops and homes in the exhibition (see section 6.1.1 for more on the site). We 
took several breaks throughout the visit, stopping whenever we saw a place that the 
infant could easily play while we sat and discussed our visit thus far. There was an 
extended rest towards the beginning where Kasi and I sat in the café while Teagan 
went in search of the toilet to change the infant’s diaper, and although we were not 
tired from the visit itself yet, it was clear that the stress of travelling to the museum 
had taken its toll.  
 
After our museum visit, we walked to a nearby pub to proceed with the post-visit 
interview. Once everyone had a chance to sit and eat something, our energy levels 
recovered, but it was clear that both Teagan and Kasi – and even I myself – were 
already tired and ready to leave. Despite these low energy levels, both Teagan and 
Kasi were eager to share their insights into our visit to Abbey House. Both expressed 
a slight frustration over the abundance of text-based interpretation, something they 

157 
 
were accustomed to and yet they found difficult. Kasi observed that she was unable 
to touch several of the text panels, further disabling her ability to read the panels and 
understand the exhibition.  
 
Later that week, I met Kasi and Teagan again in a café to conduct our follow up 
interview. Both women joked that when they finally reached home, they were so 
exhausted that they could barely do anything else for the rest of the day. Even 
Teagan’s partner commented on their exhaustion, and I was reminded of the 
physical impact visits can have, particularly on people with hidden disabilities. 
Indeed, even after several days, Teagan and Kasi both commented that they were 
still physically feeling the effects of our visit, although Kasi admitted that her trip to 
London the day after our visit likely contributed to her exhaustion and pain levels. We 
discussed our visit to Abbey House, and they confirmed that these “upticks” in pain 
and exhaustion were something that they expected and indeed planned for when 
arranging a museum visit.  
 
Additionally, they offered their insights into the pilot study itself, commenting that 
they felt the design represented a holistic understanding of their experience as 
disabled museum visitors. They offered suggestions for improvements, such as 
dismissing my plan for in-depth access audits at each site and altering some 
phrasing in the questions. They also suggested that I should supply the questions I 
intended to ask ahead of time. This last suggestion in particular I made sure to 
embed within my future interactions with participants – as Teagan and Kasi pointed 
out, people with anxiety or auditory processing issues would greatly benefit from 
knowing what I would ask prior to actually meeting me.  
6.2.2. Aaron (Treasurer’s House; autism, bipolar disorder, OCD). 
“[OCD] is when you don't enjoy it. So like most of my life, the OCD was just for 
manifestations. So usually, for most people OCD is a certain thing, but OCD 
usually hits around 12, 13. I had it when I was like 4. Dad, who was a sergeant 
in the army, didn't really understand it. So it was like cleaning, quarantine kind 
of stuff, which evolved to doing things in four, as there were four members of 
my family. So you get up four times in the morning and go back to sleep, 
which is impossible. You eat four meals, et cetera.” – Aaron (Appendix C 1.1). 

158 
 
 
Aaron was recruited through my email campaign, as described in Chapter 5. We met 
in November 2019, conducting our pre-visit interview, site visit, and post-visit 
interview in one sitting.  
6.2.2.1. Disabilities. 
Aaron told me he had been diagnosed with Asperger’s, a condition that falls under 
the autism umbrella. Autism is a neurodiverse condition that affects a person’s 
interpersonal communications, sensory input, and other mental abilities (World 
Health Organization 2021a), although he believed this might have been a 
misdiagnosis. As he said, “obviously with Asperger's, it's defining characteristic of 
someone having Asperger's is the inability to pick up nonverbal communication but I 
don't know, it seems that when I'm on a high, I'm fine” (Appendix C 1.1).  
 
He was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a mental health condition that affects a 
person’s moods, often leading to extreme mood swings (NHS 2021d). As he puts it 
(Appendix C 1.1):  
I have rapid cycling. Okay, so sporadic entirely, so it's not the typical 12 weeks of 
depression, 12 weeks mania. It could be half a day of madness, half a day of fine. 
and there's no routine or prediction. So that makes life kind of impossible. 
When trying to schedule our interviews and site visits, I encountered great difficulty 
regarding communication with Aaron. More than once, we had to reschedule our 
interview to accommodate Aaron. Understanding how his bipolar disorder affects 
him, I now believe that our difficulty in communication was in part to his bipolar 
disorder, as a manic episode could prevent him from answering messages in a 
timely fashion or adhering to a schedule. 
 
As described above, he shared that he had obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), 
which is a neurodivergent condition where a person’s brain hyperfixates on an 
intrusive thought and is compelled to act upon this intrusive thought, often in a highly 
repetitive manner (NHS 2021j). He has experienced OCD since he was a child and 
one of his coping mechanisms is pipe smoking. He explains (Appendix C 1.1):  
Smoking a pipe is quite meditative. The thing about a pipe is we don't take it back 
into your lungs. You might get mouth cancer, but you won't get lung cancer. But it 

159 
 
takes around an hour just to pack it perfectly. Like if it's not packed perfectly, it won't 
smoke perfectly. So you spend an hour just packing the pipe type of thing. And then 
you have to get a match like you can lay it with a zippo or you can light it but it's not 
really like anything else. And then you have to be conscious of not taking it back into 
your lungs. So the whole experience is very in the moment, very present, so I bring a 
pipe with me everywhere.  
The pipe not only serves as a focus for his OCD, but by carrying the pipe with him, it 
serves as a comfort object, allowing him to focus on the experience of smoking a 
pipe even when he is unable to do so. 
6.2.2.2. Data Collection. 
Aaron and I met at SPARK, an open-air community space in York. We discussed his 
disabilities, and there was a great emphasis on his bipolar disorder as we spoke. He 
told me of his daily routine, much of it spent managing his mood swings. We also 
discussed his own background and his experience as a teenager with OCD.  
 
From there, we walked to Treasurer’s House for our visit. At first, he avoided 
interacting with the room guides and skipped one room entirely, preferring to use the 
handheld interpretation boards available in each room. As we progressed, however, 
he did start to approach some of the room guides, who were all friendly and 
welcoming towards him, and asked them questions. Many of his questions had little 
to do with Treasurer’s House or Frank Green – a particular question he asked 
repeatedly was why there was no statue of Oliver Cromwell in York – but the room 
guides were always attentive and patient with him, even when they did not have an 
answer for his questions.  
 
After our visit, we returned to SPARK to conduct our post-visit interview. He 
expressed satisfaction with the experience, although he did not find the site 
particularly interesting. Despite this satisfaction, he believed that had he identified 
himself as disabled to any of the room guides, he would have been treated far more 
negatively, expecting the room guides to “[have a] look in their eyes, hair standing up 
on their arms, people kinda taking steps back” and to treat him in a “condescending, 
patronising” manner. As we discussed further, it became clear that this belief was 

160 
 
based on past encounters at other museums, not something inherent to the staff at 
Treasurer’s House.  
 
Unfortunately, I was unable to conduct a follow-up interview with Aaron.  
6.2.3. Alfie (Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision). 
“My main problem is my sight. So I see out of one eye – everything is 2D. That 
means that getting around is quite fun. Sometimes crossing a road from the 
other side is complicated. But at least it’s exciting times!” – Alfie (Appendix C 
2.1). 
 
Alfie was also recruited through my email campaign. We met in January 2020, 
conducting our pre-visit interview, site visit, and post-interview in one sitting, with a 
follow-up interview a few days later.  
6.2.3.1. Disabilities. 
Alfie’s disabilities include dyslexia and monocular vision. Dyslexia, as described in 
6.2.1.1. above, is a neurodivergent condition in which a person’s brain interprets 
letters differently, either when reading or when writing, making it difficult to engage 
with textual information (NHS 2021f). Interestingly, he shared that it was easier to 
read digital documents rather than printed ones (Appendix C 2.1):  
I guess I'm more used to readings on laptops nowadays. Okay, it doesn't strain my 
eyes to read it easier. Online, I find that my eyes won’t skip lines. Whereas on paper, 
I'm very careful. It takes a lot longer. 
Initially, I was unsure if this comment was in reference to his monocular vision or his 
dyslexia, but given the experience Kasi (Abbey House; ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, 
EDS) had with skipping lines (Appendix C 8.3), I believe it is due to his dyslexia. 
 
Adding to the difficulty in reading is his monocular vision, a physical condition in 
which a person can only see out of one eye, impeding particularly their depth 
perception (RNIB 2021). As described in the quote above, he can only see in 2D, 
and he later told me how he considered himself disabled because of how his 
monocular vision has limited the activities he can participate in: “If I compare myself 

161 
 
to how I was 10 years ago, things are completely different. I stopped doing cricket 
because I can't see the ball anymore” (Appendix C 2.4). 
 
He was at ease talking about his disabilities, and even shared that if he tires of 
reading information, he will take a photo of the information, “then if I’m interested 
later, I can read it” (Appendix C 2.1). There were other coping mechanisms that he 
discussed, particularly using the zoom function on webpages to make it easier for 
him to read or asking someone to explain something to him. Interestingly, asking 
someone to explain something was a coping strategy that Kasi (Abbey House; 
ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, EDS) employs when visiting museums as well.  
6.2.3.2. Data Collection. 
We met for our pre-visit interview in a café to discuss Alfie’s disabilities and to 
prepare for the upcoming site visit. He was very open about his disabilities and their 
impact on his daily activity, saying that his monocular vision had the biggest impact. 
He wears glasses to correct his near-sightedness, although he did mention that his 
vision has been declining and therefore his prescription has become stronger.  
 
From there, we walked to Barley Hall for our site visit. As we went around the 
museum, much of our discussion centred around the text panels that hung in each 
room or were placed near displays. Barley Hall has a mix of larger wall-hanging 
panels and smaller, hand-held panels, with a varying design palette. Although the 
panels used the colours and fonts, they were often used in different manners, shown 
in Figure 6. 
 

162 
 
 
Figure 6. Two interpretation panels at Barley Hall, showing similar colour schemes and styles but utilised in 
different ways. 
Something that I did not know before my time with Alfie was the impact of contrast 
and margins on dyslexia, and by the end of our visit, it became a type of game 
between us, where I would guess which text panel was easier for him to read and he 
would tell me if I was right or not. However, he did comment that by the end of the 
visit, he was growing weary of all the reading involved, and wished the site had more 
aural interpretation.  
 
After our visit, we went to a café to conduct our post-visit interview. Alfie reiterated 
that he would have liked more audio interpretation, particularly in the areas of the 
site that had very low lighting. As he already had difficulty reading, the low light only 
made things more difficult for him. He suggested an app or even downloadable 
resources that he could play on his phone if installing audio interpretation would be 
too costly for the site. 
 
A few days later, we met again at a café for our follow-up interview. Again, we 
discussed the over-reliance on text-based interpretation, and again, he expressed 
interest in some kind of downloadable digital content. He also told me about the 
mental energy that it took to read the panels, something I had not considered until he 

163 
 
mentioned it. He liked the hand-held panels over the wall-hanging panels because 
he could bring them closer to his face or take them to a different area in the room 
where there was better lighting, making it easier for him to read.  
6.2.4. Amanda (Barley Hall; heart failure, psoriatic arthritis). 
“My arthritis is psoriatic arthritis, all based on psoriasis. My parents have had 
severe psoriasis. They had lots of skin problems. I don't have any skin 
problems, but I have the arthritis that comes with that immune problem. So my 
arthritis attacks different things than rheumatoid arthritis. So it attacks 
cartilage, tendons and doesn't actually cause damage to them. It just causes 
lots of inflammation and pain.” – Amanda (Appendix C 3.1). 
 
Amanda was recruited through the snowball method – another volunteer shared my 
information with Amanda, who in turn contacted me to participate in my research. 
We met in November 2019, conducted our pre-visit interview, site visit, and post-
interview in one sitting, with a follow-up interview a week later. 
6.2.4.1. Disabilities. 
Amanda has psoriatic arthritis, a physical condition which causes a person’s joints to 
swell and stiffen, becoming painful and difficult to move, often significantly impeding 
a person’s mobility and dexterity (NHS 2021m). In addition to the inflammation and 
pain she describes in the quote above, she added, “I get the general fatigue that all 
people with this type of inflammatory arthritis get. Chronic fatigue is a problem” 
(Appendix C 3.1). As she explained to me, her fatigue meant that when she was still 
working, she reduced her working hours to half time before taking early retirement.  
 
In the mornings particularly, she is very stiff and needs considerable time for her 
joints to warm up and become ready to move again. She explains (Appendix C 3.1):  
I don't get up as early as I used to, so I need extra sleep. So I even now need an 
alarm to wake me up more than when I was at work. I can feel like after I've been up 
for half an hour. I feel like sometimes I just want to go back to bed. It's really hard, 
really hard to push through. I’m very stiff in the morning. I've got a right hip and my 
lower back, Spondylosis of the spine is one of the side effects of this arthritis. My 
lower spine is very stiff. And so yeah. So then as I get going, things loosen up and 
you know, I need to keep the house really warm because I can't get cold. You know, I 

164 
 
don't like going anywhere where it's cold. If somebody were to say ‘shall we go down 
to such and such today,’ I couldn't walk because of my breathing. Yes, I properly 
wouldn't walk there today. It's too cold. 
She also has to plan her time carefully, as physical exertion leads to physical 
exhaustion. As such, I was mindful to not put our meetings too close together, giving 
her time to recover but also to not take up too much of her time.  
 
In addition to her arthritis, she also has “a second problem, which I would call it a 
disability. You know, I have heart failure. Oh, I have what I am being assessed but 
haven't been listed for transplant” (Appendix C 3.1). Like her arthritis, her heart 
failure causes fatigue, meaning that she must plan things on a day by day basis. In 
addition to the fatigue, she also experiences breathlessness, something that I 
noticed as we went around Barley Hall. 
6.2.4.2. Data Collection. 
I met Amanda at her house to conduct our pre-visit interview. We discussed her 
disabilities and their impact on her daily life, particularly how she manages the pain 
and mobility difficulties. We also discussed her interest in cultural activities, 
particularly museums and gardens. As it was November and chilly, I ensured that 
she felt well enough to visit a notoriously cold site before we left. Wrapped up in a 
long coat, scarf, and gloves, she also brought a pillow with her in case she needed to 
sit and rest during our visit. 
 
We travelled by car to York city centre, parking near to Barley Hall for our site visit. 
Because of its location in a courtyard down a narrow side street (there’s no on-site 
parking for Barley Hall), we had to walk about 5 minutes from the car to the site. 
Once inside the museum, we were told that a school was in at the moment but that 
we could easily avoid them as they were in the schoolroom at the moment. It turned 
out to be a Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND) school, so I was able to 
briefly observe how Barley Hall adapted itself for such a visit. Specifically, the 
temporary ramps were set up so that a wheelchair user could cross over the 
thresholds, seen in Figure 7. 
 

165 
 
 
Figure 7. A temporary ramp set up to allow wheelchair users to cross the tall threshold in Barley Hall. 
We did not actually encounter the school group, as the layout of Barley Hall allowed 
ample opportunity to avoid them. Amanda did like that they were able to set up a 
temporary ramp, but wished that they would have something more permanent for 
people with mobility issues, as she found the thresholds particularly difficult to 
manoeuvre as the visit went on. At one point, we simply sat on a cushioned bench, 
Amanda using the pillow that she brought, giving us an opportunity to rest. She took 
several deep breaths, which I interpreted as a coping mechanism to deal with pain 
related to her arthritis, although I did not clarify this point. She pointed out the low 
light levels in certain rooms, and the fact that light text on a dark background was 
difficult for her to read when it came to the text panels. Like Alfie (Barley Hall; 
dyslexia, monocular vision), she preferred the hand-held panels to the wall-hanging 
panels, as she could more readily read them. 
 
After our visit, we went to a tea room near the car to conduct our post-visit interview. 
We discussed the visit, and she made an interesting observation (Appendix C 3.3):  

166 
 
I understand that in York, in an old city, a medieval city, you know there are 
cobblestones everywhere. It's not easy and I think I would accept that it's part of 
these places... Sometimes they go to that other end, they overcompensate and it 
does take away from the experience... you want to feel like you're going somewhere 
different. 
Her comment was in regards to the metal temporary ramp, which did seem out of 
place in a medieval townhouse, and although she appreciated that it was an 
accessibility measure, she would have preferred a solution that was more in keeping 
with the aesthetic of the overall site. 
 
I met with Amanda at her home again for our follow-up interview, and she had clearly 
been thinking of our visit. Without my prompting, she offered several suggestions for 
improving accessibility, such as a wooden (or faux wooden) temporary ramp instead 
of the metal one they use currently. She also offered the option of hanging some 
kind of knotted rope in each doorway to help people over thresholds, as she 
struggled with not having anything to grab onto as she navigated the thresholds. She 
also expressed interest in more hand-held interpretation panels, just as Alfie had 
suggested. We discussed that, like Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS) and Kasi 
(Abbey House; ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, EDS), our visit had had a significant 
impact on her energy levels for several days after, and although I apologised for the 
inconvenience, she explained to me that she had anticipated this fatigue and had 
planned for it. 
6.2.5. Amy (Treasurer’s House; anxiety, hypermobility, OCD). 
“If I was stuck behind someone else… someone [that] is slower than me going 
up the stairs, it's also difficult to be behind them. Like I have to go the speed 
that I go, if that makes sense. And slowing it down and speeding up, it’s 
painful.” – Amy on her hypermobility (Appendix C 4.3). 
 
Amy was recruited through my email campaign. We met in November 2019, 
conducted our pre-visit interview, site visit, and post-interview in one sitting, with a 
follow-up interview a few days later. 

167 
 
6.2.5.1. Disabilities. 
Amy’s disabilities include anxiety, hypermobility, and OCD. At the time she 
participated, she did not have a diagnosis for her hypermobility but she has since 
been diagnosed with EDS, the same condition that Teagan and Kasi have, 
discussed in 5.2.1.1. above. Throughout my research, I still refer to it as 
hypermobility, as that is how she understood her condition at the time. As with 
Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS) and Kasi (Abbey House; ADHD, dyslexia, 
dyspraxia, EDS), there is a constant level of joint pain, particularly in her fingers, 
wrists, toes, and knees. “Over time these become less painful but I have clear 
memories of being in agony as a child due to knee and toe pain. I now recognise 
these occasions as early subluxations” (Appendix C 4.1).  
 
The pain in turn leads to something that was commonly mentioned by other 
participants: brain fog. The term refers to a slowing down of cognitive function, 
resulting in “slow thinking, difficulty focusing, confusion, lack of concentration, 
forgetfulness, or a haziness in thought processes” (Ocon 2013, 1). The exact cause 
of brain fog is still not understood, particularly as it seems connected to so many 
different conditions, but for Amy, it “means I can get easily overwhelmed and my 
pain/fatigue levels can quickly get out of control if I don't manage it” (Appendix C 
4.1). Amy is not the only participant who mentioned brain fog. In fact, Teagan (Abbey 
House; dyslexia, EDS), Amanda (Barley Hall; heart failure, psoriatic arthritis), Ellie 
(Treasurer’s House; anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, depression, fibromyalgia), 
James (Treasurer’s House; fibromyalgia), and Jessica (Treasurer’s House; dyslexia, 
Irlen syndrome) all reference brain fog in their interviews with me. 
 
Amy also has anxiety, a mental health condition in which a person experiences 
heightened distress, worry, or fear in relation to a wide variety of situations and 
issues, making it difficult for them to fully rest (NHS 2021). For Amy, she has 
experienced anxiety since she was a child; however, she dismisses it as simply 
being a “worrier.” As she grew, however, these worries and anxieties became more 
specific (Appendix C 4.1):  
Something that causes me a lot of anxiety is other people's health. I often get into 
thought spirals that lead to panic attacks where I am convinced that someone I love 
is unwell or in danger. These are extremely damaging to my own mental health but 

168 
 
also to my relationships because it's a lot of pressure to have to deal with in the 
moment, especially when I'm directing so much anxiety and panic their way.  
Her point about the impact on her relationships is illuminating, as not only does it 
show a striking level of self-reflection on Amy’s part, but it also highlights the effects 
that a hidden disability, especially a mental health condition, can have on multiple 
aspects of a person’s life. Not only does her anxiety make it difficult for her to rest, it 
similarly puts pressure on those around her to pull her out of a “spiral.” 
 
She also has OCD, which I discuss in 6.2.2.1. above. Her experience of OCD differs 
from Aaron, however, as it is so entwined with her anxiety. Her spirals are typical for 
OCD, which makes a person hyperfixate on intrusive thoughts, compelling them to 
act on these thoughts. For Amy, she hyperfixates on the health of her loved ones, 
whilst her anxiety will supply increasingly alarming intrusive thoughts, and so the 
spiral begins. She also has certain fixations around food: “I have a very short list of 
'safe foods'. Everything else I can't eat. This is difficult to explain because it's not just 
a 'I don't think this' but it's like my body can't accept that it's food” (Appendix C 4.1).  
 
Additionally, Amy tends to pre-plan quite a lot of her trips. Interestingly, all of her 
disabilities seem to feed into how she plans. She will plan how to get to a place, 
finding a route that “requires the least amount of walking and if there are long 
periods of walking that are unavoidable, I’ll look into getting an Uber some of the way 
or find out if there’s a café or somewhere to rest inside” (Appendix C 4.1), an 
intersection of her anxiety and her hypermobility. Much like Teagan (Abbey House; 
dyslexia, EDS), as outlined in 6.2.1.1. above, cafés are also a useful location not 
only to rest, but to manage any onset of fatigue or low blood pressure caused by her 
hypermobility. However, if there is no café at a location, she will make sure to not 
only carry some food and drink with her, but also check the site’s policy on bringing 
in food. The night before, she prepares everything she will need for the next day – 
although she freely admits that she tends to overpack and constantly re-check her 
bag, something she attributes to her anxiety and OCD (Appendix D 4.1). 
6.2.5.2. Data Collection. 
I met Amy at a café for our pre-visit interview. Unfortunately, the recording device 
stopped working a few minutes into our interview and, because the café was louder 

169 
 
than I expected, the recording that I did have was unintelligible. I took notes during 
our interview, however, and also emailed her afterwards to explain the situation. She 
was kind enough to write out her answers to my interview questions to make up for 
the missing recording. Relevant sections of her email are included in Appendix C. 
 
Like Alfie (Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision), Amy was very comfortable in 
discussing her disabilities. She told me about how she did not have a specific 
diagnosis for her hypermobility, although she thought it was part of a larger health 
problem and was working with her doctors to determine the cause. She also told me 
how her anxiety and OCD in particular were linked to each other – each condition 
made her overthink choices or potential situations, feeding into one another and 
creating a cycle of intrusive thoughts and anxiety that is difficult to break. This 
overthinking also leads to a great of mental exhaustion, although with her new EDS 
diagnosis, I believe that the constant pain associated with EDS is also a factor in her 
mental exhaustion. She told me the measures she takes when planning a museum 
visit, particularly what she takes with her to prepare for eventualities, including a 
bottle of diet coke (in case she needs caffeine and/or sugar quickly), water, pain 
killers, and a book (a calming tactic if her anxiety becomes overwhelming). In order 
to “calm” her OCD and anxiety, she also spends time on a museum’s website before 
visiting and spends around an hour the night before preparing for a visit, including 
checking several times to make sure that she has everything she believes she needs 
for the visit.  
 
On the day of our visit, we walked to Treasurer’s House from the café where we met. 
As we went around the site, she observed people within rooms to see if a particular 
behaviour was allowed. For example, she mentioned to me that she was unsure if 
she could pick up a hand-held interpretation panel to read more about a particular 
chair she found interesting. However, after seeing someone else pick up a similar 
panel, she felt comfortable enough to pick up the panel herself. As we headed up the 
main staircase, she noted the placement of a garland on the banister, saying that if 
she was having a bad day with her hypermobility, this would have a significant 
impact on her ability to use the stairs. Throughout the visit, she chatted with each of 
the room guides, although she did need to sit a few times. 
 

170 
 
After our visit, we went to a nearby café to conduct our post-visit interview. She 
clarified several things that I had observed during our visit, particularly her need to 
sit. She said that whilst it was obvious where a visitor should not sit, it was not 
always clear where they should. Likewise, she would have appreciated to know what 
things she was able to touch, rather than an endless list of things that she could not 
touch. She also would have preferred more directions around the property, such as a 
suggested route because “I enjoy not having to make any decisions” (Appendix C 
4.3), implying that her anxiety meant she was always second-guessing where she 
should go next. 
 
I met Amy a few days later at a café for our follow-up interview. As with several other 
participants, she felt physical symptoms the next day. For Amy, it came in the form of 
leg pain and “brain fog,” which I describe in 6.2.5.1. above. She reiterated much of 
what we had discussed previously, and emphasised that her disabilities mean that 
her level of impairment varies from day to day, so she may not always know what 
accessibilities measures she needs. That also feeds into her over-preparing for 
many of her trips, as her anxiety and OCD need to plan for every eventuality, no 
matter how ridiculous. 
6.2.6. Ellie (Treasurer’s House; anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, depression, 
fibromyalgia). 
“The migraine makes it quite difficult working with computers and things. I 
have a lot of external triggers, like some lights in shops – I can’t go into certain 
shops because it’s just an immediate migraine trigger. That was so severe 
when I was younger that I’d be taken out of school. So that’s quite a problem – 
I have to plot where I go according to what I can tolerate at the moment.” – Ellie 
(Appendix C 5.1). 
 
Ellie was recruited through my email campaign. We met in November 2019, 
conducted our pre-visit interview, site visit, and post-interview in one sitting, with a 
follow-up interview a few days later. 

171 
 
6.2.6.1. Disabilities. 
Ellie has several mental health conditions, including anxiety – discussed above in 
6.2.5.1. – and depression, a condition in which a person is unable to emotionally 
engage in their usual activities, often leading to difficulty participating in these same 
activities (NHS 2021l). For Ellie, her anxiety and depression manifests more as a 
block in her everyday activities. She told me (Appendix C 5.1):  
Anxiety and depression sort of go hand in hand, in that I get very stressed out very 
easily... It stopped me from doing things quite a lot in terms of like, trying to get the 
momentum up to do things. So it's quite draining in that way. Even just simple stuff 
like doing washing up, it feels kind of like a mental battle to actually get to the point of 
being able to do it. 
 
The “mental battle” Ellie describes is a symptom called “executive dysfunction,” 
where there is a disconnect between the person’s desire to do something and then 
finding the physical energy to do it (Healthline 2021) and it is a common side effect 
of clinical depression (McLennan and Mathias 2010; Dunkin et al. 2000). Executive 
dysfunction is not solely related to mental health conditions, and indeed, many 
people with chronic conditions or neurodiverse people experience executive 
dysfunction (Roberts et al. 2017; Grober et al. 2011). From an outsider perspective, 
the person experiencing executive dysfunction may appear lazy, disorganised, or 
even rude, but the reality is that the person is, for the moment, incapable of 
performing a particular task. For Ellie, she is theoretically capable of washing her 
dishes. However, when she is experiencing executive dysfunction, the dishes are an 
insurmountable task.  
 
Interestingly, there is a connection between physical impairments and mental health 
conditions such as depression and anxiety, particularly with chronic conditions like 
fibromyalgia (Bernik et al. 2013; Buskila and Cohen 2007; Fietta et al. 2007), which 
Ellie also has. Fibromyalgia is a physical condition that causes pain all over the 
body, also called “flares” (NHS 2021h). For Ellie, the condition “is constant 
widespread pain, particularly my joints. For me it tends to be worse in my knees so I 
walk with a stick for the majority of the time” (Appendix C 5.1). However, like Amy 
(Treasurer’s House; anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) in 6.2.5.1. above, the pain causes 
extreme fatigue and brain fog for Ellie, “so quite often even simple tasks are really 

172 
 
difficult because I just can't compute what I actually need to be doing” (Appendix C 
5.1). 
 
She also experiences chronic vestibular migraines, a physical condition where a 
person experiences frequent migraines particularly affecting their sense of balance 
(Johns Hopkins Medicine 2021). For Ellie, these migraines are not only extremely 
painful headaches “but also, with the particular kind I get, I struggle a lot with 
dizziness because it affects my inner ear as well, so I got lots of symptoms like 
motion sickness… sometimes collapsing with visual problems as well” (Appendix C 
5.1). The “visual problems” Ellie references are called migraine auras, which are 
dark lines or spots that appear in a person’s vision, normally occurring before a 
migraine appears (Mayo Clinic 2021). Sometimes, these spots turn into fully blacked-
out vision. Unfortunately, two particular migraine triggers for Ellie are linked to digital 
screens and lighting. She explained that “the migraine makes it quite difficult working 
with computers and things and I have a lot of external triggers like some lights in 
shops, like I can't go into certain shops” (Appendix C 5.1). To avoid these triggers, 
Ellie has to “kind of plot where I go according to like, can I tolerate XYZ at the 
moment” (Appendix C 5.1) and also uses a screen reader when using digital 
devices. However, “I tend to use it more on like actual documents as opposed to 
websites because it does not respond very well to websites” (Appendix C 5.1). The 
inaccessibility of these improperly formatted websites means that for Ellie, “it's just 
easier to risk the migraine or just have a quick look rather than wait for my screen 
reader to battle through the website” (Appendix C 5.1). Considering how debilitating 
and even dangerous these migraines are for Ellie, the increasing digital-dependency 
of the world has become a barrier in its own right to Ellie and her disability. 
6.2.6.2. Data Collection. 
I met Ellie at her home to conduct our pre-visit interview. We discussed her 
disabilities, especially the varying nature of them and how they have become 
progressively worse as she had gone through university. She also explained to me 
that out of all her diagnoses, it was her migraines that affected her the most, 
especially as they are triggered by certain types of light, especially computers. 
Additionally, she explained to me how she prepared for a visit. Like Amy (Treasurer’s 
House; anxiety, hypermobility, OCD), she tended to pack everything the night before, 

173 
 
including pain killers, anti-nausea medication, her walking stick, and a snack (in case 
of a migraine or fibro flare), as well as making sure her phone was fully charged in 
case she needed to call for help whilst she was out. 
 
We then walked to Treasurer’s House. Given that we were visiting in November, she 
was dressed warmly to counteract the cold, as the chill could cause her fibromyalgia 
to flare up. As we walked through the property, she did eventually bring out her 
collapsible walking stick, a move I took to mean she was beginning to feel pain in her 
joints. She liked the hand-held interpretation boards, although she did find them 
slightly unwieldy when she tried to use them as she held her walking stick. Like Amy, 
Ellie expressed a desire for a more “official” route to follow, as she wanted to ensure 
she saw the whole property. She also struggled with the lighting levels, particularly 
when we moved from a dimly lit room to a bright one. The change in levels, she 
explained, could potentially trigger a migraine for her. Also, the flame-shaped bulbs 
that had been installed in some rooms, shown in Figure 8, were particularly painful 
for her, as they were intensely bright. 
 

174 
 
 
Figure 8. The small but intensely bright bulbs were a potential migraine trigger for Ellie at Treasurer’s House. 
After our visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct our post-visit interview. She 
expanded on certain things I had noticed during our visit. For example, she pulled 
out her walking stick because she was having difficulty with the pace of the visit, 
having to walk for a bit and then stop, which was tough on her joints. She also 
explained that the lighting levels, aside from being a potential migraine trigger, made 
it difficult for her to read. She was already experiencing some brain fog, and the 
extra effort needed to engage with the text meant she tired more easily. She, like 
Alfie, also mentioned a desire for more audio interpretation aside from room guides. 
 
I met Ellie at a café a few days later to conduct our follow-up interview. As with 
several other participants, she was extremely tired the day after our visit. She 
actually expressed surprise about this, however, as she did not expect it to have 
such an impact on her. She still explained that the lighting levels were the most 

175 
 
significant barrier she encountered, but that it was her fibromyalgia that had the 
biggest impact on her visit. The continual change in energy and momentum was 
particularly hard on her hips and knees, areas that are especially affected by her 
fibromyalgia. She too mentioned the garland on the banister, and although according 
to her it did not present an extreme barrier, it did have an impact on her ability to use 
the stairs.    
6.2.7. James (Treasurer’s House; fibromyalgia). 
“Everything hurts. No, no, no. That's as good as anything. Everything hurts. 
Okay, so knees, ankles, toes, fingers, elbows, shoulders, neck. Everything 
hurts okay? It comes and goes, sometimes good. Some times are better than 
normal. Some days are okay. And then other days are horrendous.” – James 
(Appendix C 6.1). 
 
James was recruited personally as he was a co-worker of mine at the time and had 
shared with me his journey to a diagnosis with fibromyalgia. We met in November 
2019, conducted our pre-visit interview, site visit, and post-interview in one sitting, 
with a follow-up interview a few days later. 
6.2.7.1. Disabilities. 
At the time of his participation, James was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia, 
which I describe above in 6.2.6.1. He mirrors Ellie’s experience of widespread pain 
due to fibromyalgia, even explaining that “I've had a couple of days of just chilling on 
the sofa” (Appendix C 6.1) in preparation for our site visit. He expressed a great 
relief at the time regarding this diagnosis, as he had been experiencing unexplained 
pain for years. He called the diagnosis “a bit of a blessed relief – horrible to hear but 
a blessed relief” (Appendix C 6.1). His expression of relief is a common theme 
amongst many people with chronic conditions (e.g., Huibers and Wessely 2006), 
including other participants such as Amy (Treasurer’s House; anxiety, hypermobility, 
OCD) and Jessica (Treasurer’s House; dyslexia, Irlen syndrome). A diagnosis can 
be a vindicating experience for a disabled person, proving their symptoms are not 
psychosomatic. For James, the stress of constant pain was only matched by the 
stress of trying to understand the cause of it. He explained (Appendix C 6.1): 

176 
 
I just thought it was age. And this is what happens when you get old… I did notice 
and work did notice that I was taking more and more time off, that I would wake up in 
the morning in agonising pain, I couldn't understand why I was in agonising pain… 
So obviously, you have those five and six years of non-stop tests and you know, 
waiting for appointments and before it was arthritis at one point and all sorts of 
things. They obviously added stress to my life because not knowing what was 
causing the pains was a big, big problem.  
 
As his diagnosis was fairly recent, at the time of his participation in this research he 
was still learning coping mechanisms to deal with the pain and other symptoms. He 
had connected his Alexa device to his lights, so he could voice-activate them on bad 
days when “things like turning on light switches could hurt if you just press it on a 
really bad day and press the light switch pain would just rocket through your body 
and you'll be useless for the next 20 minutes” (Appendix C 6.1). He planned on 
adding more voice-activated technology to his home over time when he had the 
means to do so.  
 
To understand how different actions may take different levels of energy each day, 
James explained he uses the “spoon method” to measure what he is able to do. The 
“spoon theory” is popular amongst people with chronic illnesses, who call 
themselves “spoonies,” as a way to explain to nondisabled people why they are 
limited in what they can do on any given day (Miserandino 2003). As James puts it, 
“you start off with a number of spoons depending on how you feel in the morning and 
then grade your activities accordingly” (Appendix C 6.1). “Spoons” can be 
understood as units of energy or effort, and the amount of spoons a person has will 
vary from day to day, based on the symptoms of their particular chronic condition. 
For example, James may start a high-pain day with only 20 “spoons.” If it takes 3 
spoons for him to get out of bed, another 5 spoons to get dressed, and 2 further 
spoons to make a bowl of cereal for breakfast, he has already used half of his 
“spoons” for the day. Ellie also mentioned using the spoon theory to plan her day. 
She shared that “simple day to day tasks like going to the shop, like having lectures, 
I have to allot a lot more time because it's just physically exhausting for me and quite 
often I get back and I just have to like get straight into bed because it just takes up 
so many spoons” (Appendix C 5.1). The spoon theory then is a useful tool for 

177 
 
disabled people to “measure” their day, and something I was cognizant of when 
scheduling interviews and visits with my participants.  
6.2.7.2. Data Collection. 
I met James at DIG, another museum run by YAT and one we were both well-
acquainted with, to conduct our pre-visit interview. We discussed his recent 
diagnosis, particularly how it was more a process of elimination than a specific test 
for fibromyalgia. Prior to his diagnosis, he thought the pain was merely a side effect 
of growing older, but he had also had additional stress because of the pain for over 
five years now. He told me that he uses a walking stick to move around sometimes, 
and is comfortable enough to cancel plans if he is having a particularly bad day.  
 
We walked to Treasurer’s House from there. During our visit, James did not use his 
walking stick, although he did sit several times. He noticed the lack of handrails in 
many locations, and a particular irritation of his was the garland on the banister. 
Because of the lack of handrails, he held on to walls, columns, and even the garland 
in order to climb steps. In one of the rooms, a room guide showed us the detailing on 
a particular piece of furniture, pulling out a handheld torch to show us. I discuss this 
small act later in Chapter 8, but James and I both found it interesting that the lighting 
was so poor in the room that a handheld torch was needed to see the intricate 
detailing on a primary feature of the room. 
 
After our visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct our post-visit interview. Again 
and again, James mentioned the lack of handrails and especially the garland tied to 
the banister as barriers that stood out to him. He also would have liked more seating 
and, as mentioned by Ellie and Amy, more directions throughout the property. 
 
I met with James a few days after our visit to conduct our follow-up interview. He told 
me he experienced more pain the day after, but he had anticipated this. He once 
again reiterated the banister as his enduring memory of the visit, and hoped that this 
would be remedied soon.  

178 
 
6.2.8. Jessica (Treasurer’s House; dyslexia, Irlen syndrome). 
“With Irlen syndrome, it's a light sensitivity and disability. So for example, if 
there's really harsh lighting, or if there's lots of like, you know, writing on a 
page like this, and I find it quite hard to read it because my brain is kind of 
working really hard. And that's when I kind of started to get a bit tired and a bit 
stressed and a bit frustrated.” – Jessica (Appendix C 7.1). 
 
Jessica was recruited through my email campaign, although I had known and 
worked with her previously. She had not been diagnosed when we first met, although 
she had been dealing with the impact of her disabilities all her life. We met in 
October 2019, conducted our pre-visit interview, site visit, and post-interview in one 
sitting, with a follow-up interview a few days later. 
6.2.8.1. Disabilities. 
Like James, Jessica had received her diagnosis not long before she participated in 
my research. She has dyslexia, which I discuss in 6.2.1.1., and also Irlen syndrome, 
a neurodivergent condition where a person’s brain interprets light differently, often 
leading to difficulty reading and writing (Irlen 2021). For Jessica, it is difficult to 
separate the two conditions, as there is considerable overlap between both the 
symptoms and the side effects of each. No matter which condition is responsible for 
it, she explained to me that “I particularly struggle with spelling and reading and stuff 
like that and being able to find the difference between different types of words” 
(Appendix C 7.1).  
 
Both her dyslexia and Irlen syndrome had a significant impact on her reading and 
writing ability, and as she told me, “it's not because I'm stupid, it’s because I have a 
disability and I just need some extra tools to do for me to be able to read and excel in 
studying” (Appendix C 7.1). The additional tools include her colour overlay, which I 
discuss further in Chapter 8, and screen reading software. The screen reader 
particularly is to aid her in her degree, as her disabilities make it difficult for her to 
edit her writing. As she said (Appendix C 7.1),  
Instead of having to kind of just sit there and read, I can just have it read to me. And 
basically when I was proofreading in my work and stuff like that, I could read it 1,000 
times but I wasn’t seeing any spelling mistakes. But as soon as it's being read aloud 

179 
 
to me, I can easily kind of point out ‘Oh, I've used a wrong spelling there,’ or ‘I've 
misspelled that,’ or ‘that's probably when I could use a new sentence or a new 
paragraph’ or stuff like that. 
Her preference for auditory means of processing information was something she 
commented on later when we were discussing museum visits. She told me that she 
always checked if a museum had audio guides, “because I know that I will learn 
better about the museum rather than just standing there and reading” (Appendix C 
7.1).  
 
However, the impact of her disabilities extends beyond her reading comprehension. 
Like Ellie’s vestibular migraines, Jessica’s Irlen syndrome means that certain kinds 
of lighting have a significant physical impact on her. She shared (Appendix C 7.1): 
In Primark a few times when I was younger, I did pass out and obviously I just didn't 
realize what it was [at the time]. But when I had my tests for my Irlen in July, I did 
mention about the lights in Primark, that sometimes I did pass out, and [the test 
proctor] was like, ‘Yeah, I've had lots of people mention that before.’  
As will be discussed in Chapter 8, lighting conditions can present a significant barrier 
for many people in public buildings, especially museums.  
6.1.8.2. Data Collection. 
I met Jessica in her home to conduct our pre-visit interview. She told me about her 
disabilities and particularly how she had been adapting since her recent diagnosis. 
Like James, there was a sense of relief, knowing there was a reason she had such 
difficulty reading and writing. She showed me some of the accessibility tools that she 
had started using, such as special software that reads text to her and a coloured 
overlay that she used on printed materials. She pointed out that the overlay was 
small enough to fit inside her purse so that she could carry it around and use it even 
when she was out. When preparing to visit a museum, she tends to carry out 
extensive research on the place, referencing documentaries, YouTube, and 
podcasts as particular sources of information that utilise audio formats. She would 
also check to see if there were audio tours available to hire at a site, once again 
showing her preference for audio information.  
 

180 
 
From there, we walked to Treasurer’s House. As we went around, she particularly 
liked the hand-held interpretation panels, especially because they were printed with 
an off-white background, something that helps both her dyslexia and her Irlen 
syndrome. She also used her overlay quite a lot, and although earlier she had said 
that she was self-conscious about using the overlay in public, she felt confident using 
them in this setting because no one else could see it whilst she was holding the 
panel. She did note that the lighting was quite dim, making her struggle somewhat 
with reading. There were also laminated sheets that she picked up to read, but given 
how shiny the surface was, she did not bother trying to read them and simply put 
them back. Continuing through the site, she wondered if it was possible for the 
property to put PDF copies of these interpretation panels on their website for visitors 
to download and read in their own time (and, presumably, with their own screen 
readers or other accessibility aids).  
 
Afterwards, we walked to a nearby café to conduct our post-visit interview. She 
reiterated a lot of what we discussed whilst going around the site, particularly the 
impact of lighting on her ability to enjoy her visit and also the reliance on written 
interpretation. She was somewhat disappointed with her overall visit, as she was 
eager to learn about the house and its last owner, Frank Green, but could only 
access that information by speaking to room guides. She liked the hand-held 
interpretation panels, but she had a difficult time engaging with them.  
 
A few days later, I met Jessica at a café to conduct our follow-up interview. Once 
again, she emphasised the lighting issue, telling me that she ended up having a 
headache after she left our final interview. She also said that she was unlikely to 
revisit, as she could not engage with the material and, as she put it, could therefore 
not have a meaningful experience. 
6.2.9. Lisa (Abbey House; general anxiety). 
“I went to a Thai restaurant with some friends for their birthday. And I had to 
look online and I was like, ‘I can't pronounce anything. I don't know what these 
things are.’ So I just went with the Tikka Masala because I know what that is.” 
– Lisa (Appendix C 9.1). 
 

181 
 
Lisa was recruited through my Twitter campaign. We met in November 2019, 
conducted our pre-visit interview, site visit, and post-interview in one sitting, with a 
follow-up interview over the phone a few days later. 
6.2.9.1. Disabilities. 
Lisa has general anxiety, initially discussed in 6.2.5.1. above, but hers is particularly 
focused around social situations. As she explained, “I can't just go out somewhere, I 
have to kind of think about how I look and think about how I'm going to get 
somewhere, whether that's parking or buses, it's kind of planning to the extreme” 
(Appendix C 9.1). Understandably, it has had a significant impact on her social life 
(Appendix C 9.1):  
It means that I cancel my plans a lot. I don't always give the real reasons for 
cancelling. So you know I might tell my friends I'm really sorry and I know it was 
gonna come out but this has come up yeah. Or sometimes like it causes migraines, 
you know I have to cancel just because I'm just generally not feeling well. 
 
The physical side effects of a hidden disability are a common theme amongst my 
participants. By ‘side effects,’ I mean a physical symptom that is not intrinsic to the 
condition itself. For example, Teagan’s EDS means her body does not create 
enough collagen (NHS 2021g). However, the side effects of her EDS include her 
body’s inability to digest red meat (Appendix C 8.1). For Lisa, her anxiety can lead to 
migraines. Nearly every participant has described to me a side effect relating to one 
or more of their hidden disabilities, making it all the more important to take the lived 
experience of people with hidden disabilities seriously. The information regarding 
these side effects is not something that is discussed in the literature about these 
conditions, and by asking my participants about their disabilities, I believe that my 
research is far more thorough than if I had limited myself to published studies. 
6.2.9.2. Data Collection. 
I met Lisa at Kirkstall Abbey to conduct our pre-visit interview. We discussed her 
disability, particularly about how her anxiety was mostly social. She often cancels 
plans with friends or plans these outings to an extreme, even practicing what she 
would order at a restaurant so that she did not have a panic attack when ordering. 
Likewise, when planning a museum visit, she plans out every detail. Not only does 
she scour a museum’s website, she also checks their location on Google maps, 

182 
 
particularly street view so that she knows what the building will look like when she 
arrives there. Much of this matches with what Amy and Ellie, who also have anxiety, 
described when they plan outings.  
 
We then crossed the street to Abbey House. She explained to me that her partner 
works for Leeds Museums & Galleries, the organisation that runs Abbey House, but 
that she was feeling slightly anxious about visiting anyway. Because of her anxiety, I 
did not record our visit through the museum. As we moved through the museum, I 
noticed that she avoided areas where there were groups of people already milling 
about. She also tended to look more at the objects than the accompanying 
interpretation. Our visit was brief, something I assumed was due to her nerves.  
 
After our visit, we walked to a nearby pub to conduct our post-visit interview. Lisa 
seemed far more relaxed in that environment, and when I asked her, she said that 
she was worried about what the staff members were thinking of her. She also 
clarified that she was avoiding the areas where people were congregating, as it was 
too crowded in those areas and it made her nervous. She also wanted museums to 
have more quiet hours, although she was unlikely to use them as she did not want to 
crowd people who “deserved it” more than she did (Appendix 9.2). 
 
A few days later, Lisa and I conducted our follow-up interview over the phone. She 
told me that the evening after our visit, she had a panic attack. She was rather 
surprised by this, as she did not expect to be so impacted by the visit. She was also 
tired the next day, another thing she did not expect. However, she was still 
enthusiastic about participating. She reiterated that she did not enjoy the crowded 
areas, and tried to avoid them as much as she could. She also revealed that she did 
not view herself as disabled. Given that I had already caused one panic attack, I did 
not pursue this particular line of questioning, but reflecting upon this comment and 
also that she did not like to use accessibility tools so that other “more disabled” 
people could use them, I wonder if her anxiety regarding how people viewed her led 
to this particular viewpoint.  

183 
 
6.2.10. Teagan – Barley Hall Follow-up. 
As will be discussed in Chapter 6, all my case study sites changed and adapted to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideally, I would have liked to take a participant around 
each site to comment on the changes, but time and circumstances did not allow for 
this. Teagan kindly offered to visit Barley Hall with me, to give her insights into the 
changes. Although she had not visited this site as part of my research, she was 
familiar with the pre-COVID-19 experience and could contrast that knowledge with 
their current experience.  
 
I conducted our visit in the same manner I had conducted other site visits: I followed 
Teagan’s lead, allowing her to explore the site at her pace. She mourned the lack of 
interactive elements, a feature she had enjoyed greatly in the past, but she 
expressed excitement at the availability of the map. She did point out some design 
features that would make it more accessible for visitors with dyslexia, particularly the 
contrast of the white text within black boxes. She also commented that, upon 
entering the Steward’s Room, the placement of a table meant she had to make a 
particularly hard right-angle turn, something that was difficult for her due to her EDS 
and, she presumed, also difficult for people with other physical or mobility 
difficulties.  
 
Given that we had conducted a pre-visit interview during the pilot study (see 6.2.1.2. 
above), I did not repeat this interview with her. Instead, we conducted the site visit as 
outlined in Chapter 5, as well as a post-visit interview, again outlined in Chapter 5. I 
did not record audio for this site visit or interview, but my field notes and diary can be 
found in Appendices D and E. 
6.3. Summary. 
Throughout this chapter, I have presented the data I collected from both participants 
and case study sites. Through semi-structured interviews, onsite visits, and 
observations, I gathered a significant amount of data regarding the barriers that my 
participants faced, as well as the organisational responses to these barriers. In the 
next chapter, I examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both my research 
and the heritage sector at large, and discuss the changes that each case study site 

184 
 
put into place in response to the pandemic. I also consider the impact that these 
changes have on the accessibility of the site. 
 
 
 

185 
 
Chapter 7 – COVID-19 and Its 
Impacts. 
On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organisation was informed of an outbreak 
of a virus that would come to be known as the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, centred 
in Wuhan City, China (Andersen et al. 2020). In January, the virus was identified and 
sequenced, adopting the name COVID-19. On 31 January 2020, the first cases in 
the UK were detected in York, and from there, the virus spread to the rest of the 
country. As of November 2021, over 263 million cases have been diagnosed 
worldwide, with more than 5.2 million fatalities (World Health Organization 2021d). In 
the UK, over 10.3 million people have tested positive for the virus, with over 145,000 
fatalities (World Health Organization 2021d). Even with the advent of vaccination 
programmes, the virus is still mutating, causing considerable concern and leaving a 
profound impact on the world, the heritage industry, and this research.  
 
In this chapter, I begin by briefly discussing what COVID-19 is, along with the newer 
condition of Long COVID. I then discuss the necessary pivots that took place in my 
research as a consequence of the pandemic, whilst also considering how the 
pandemic the other doctoral research. I then turn to the implications of the pandemic 
on the heritage sector as a whole. Next, I discuss how, as lockdowns and restrictions 
came to an end, museums and heritage sites were able to re-open, and I position 
these re-openings around a discussion of associated governmental reopening 
guidelines as well as the Seven Principles for Inclusive Recovery. The latter have 
been created by the UK Disability Arts Alliance in order to ensure disabled people 
are not excluded from recovery efforts in the name of expediency. Adapting the 
governmental guidelines and the Seven Principles as a framework, I explain the 
accessibility-related changes that were made to each of my three case study sites. 
Finally, I discuss these changes in terms of their impact on the accessibility of the 
sites. 

186 
 
7.1. COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. 
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, commonly referred to as COVID-19, is primarily spread 
through droplets of saliva or nasal discharge, such as when a person speaks or 
sneezes. Symptoms of the disease include fever, a dry, persistent cough, and the 
loss of taste and/or smell (World Health Organization 2021c). More serious infections 
require hospitalisation, as the illness can cause chest pain, difficulty breathing, and 
even loss of speech or movement. As the pandemic persisted, it became clear that 
certain communities were more affected by the virus- and more seriously – than 
others. Although there has been research into the racial, socio-economic, and 
gender disparities in COVID-19 patient demographics, the link between underlying 
(chronic) conditions and more serious COVID-19 symptoms is especially relevant for 
my research. As may be expected with a virus that causes respiratory distress, 
people with chronic conditions such as asthma, COPD, and other lung conditions are 
considered especially vulnerable (NHS 2021k). In addition to people with lung 
conditions, a variety of other chronic conditions are considered to put people at high 
risk, such as epilepsy, heart disease, and – relevant to this research – arthritis and 
other joint conditions. Recall that several of my participants have joint conditions: 
James and Ellie both identify as having fibromyalgia, Teagan, Kasi, and Amy as 
having EDS, and Amanda as having arthritis. Exactly why these conditions present a 
greater risk of more serious COVID-related complications is still being explored, but 
even early on, the UK government identified people with certain chronic conditions 
as being “at risk” and asked them to “shield” or stay at home to avoid exposure to the 
virus (NHS 2021a). Disability activists have rightly called many of these measures 
discriminatory, putting undue responsibility on disabled people who already face 
barriers in their everyday life (Pring 2021a; Shoosmiths 2021) and further isolating 
them from their workplaces and social situations. A side effect of the pandemic has 
been a surge in mental health issues stemming from the multiple national lockdowns 
and the isolation that people subsequently feel (Abbott 2021; Mental Health 
Foundation 2021), but little has been reported on the intersection between chronic 
conditions, shielding, and mental health. It should be remembered from Chapter 6 
that chronic conditions and mental health conditions are often comorbid, and 
therefore disabled people are very likely experiencing even greater mental health 

187 
 
issues than their nondisabled counterparts, especially with government-mandated 
isolation still being advised more than a year into the pandemic (NHS 2021a). 
 
In 2021, a new phenomenon emerged, called “Long COVID” (NHS 2021i). For most 
people, symptoms of the virus last 10-14 days. However, for a small percentage of 
those infected, the symptoms do not fully disappear. In fact, one of my participants, 
Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS), did contract the virus, and although she 
recovered, she became a Long COVID patient. Her symptoms, including breathing 
difficulties and severe fatigue, were persistent even eleven months later. Over a year 
after the initial illness, she still has difficulty walking and talking at the same time and 
has had to reduce how many hours a day she can work at her job. Interestingly, 
once she received the first dose of the vaccine, her Long COVID symptoms cleared 
up within three weeks. She is not alone in her experience (Kingsland 2021), and 
there could be profound implications for other chronic conditions if this reversal is 
better understood (Grover 2021). Chronic fatigue syndrome in particular is one 
condition that, as well as often being a post-viral condition, may benefit from some 
form of vaccine therapy (Marshall 2021). Additionally, there have already been calls 
to consider Long COVID a disability (ACAS 2021; Trade Unions Congress 2021). 
Should these calls be heeded, it would not only increase the disabled population, but 
it also has the potential to shape discussions around disability and inclusion, as a 
large number of previously healthy, nondisabled people are suddenly excluded from 
aspects of their previous lives due to their new disability. Although nondisabled 
people become disabled every day, the collective nature of Long COVID could prove 
to be a catalyst for positive change. 
7.2. COVID-19 and this Research. 
On 31 January 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in the UK in York 
(BBC 2020). At that time, I was in the process of gathering data with my participants 
and setting up observation dates with my case study sites. In March 2020, a national 
lockdown was announced, forcing the closures of all non-essential locations, 
including museums and heritage sites. Data collection on this research was paused 
and instead I focused on data analysis, waiting for sites to open again. However, as 
the lockdown continued, it became apparent that when sites did open again, they 

188 
 
would be profoundly changed due to COVID-19 adaptations. Through discussions 
with my supervisor, I decided that data collection from participants had come to an 
enforced end. The pre-COVID museum experience no longer existed, and to 
compare that with a post-COVID museum experience seemed unequal, even when 
looking at the same site, because so many adaptations to each site had occurred. 
 
Additionally, and more importantly, it seemed inappropriate to ask people with 
hidden disabilities to accompany me on a museum visit and potentially expose them 
to the virus. I was not the only researcher to face such a decision: doctoral 
researchers across the globe were forced to pause and adapt their research projects 
(Levine et al. 2021; Bradt 2020; Johnson et al. 2020; Radecki and Schonfeld 2020; 
Wang and DeLaquil 2020). As Brandt writes (2020, 297-8):  
Although flexibility and responsiveness are core characteristics of qualitative 
research, few researchers would have anticipated the extent of responsiveness 
needed in their research. For some researchers, their very research questions may 
have become irrelevant or even trivial in light of this pandemic. 
Particularly for interpersonal research that relied upon in-person interactions, the 
pandemic and ensuing lockdowns meant that not only did research frameworks need 
to adapt, but so did the pool of participants that researchers could connect to (Levine 
et al. 2021; Radecki and Schonfeld 2020). For some researchers, this meant 
delaying fieldwork opportunities until the pandemic subsided (Radecki and Schonfeld 
2020), whilst others were forced to cancel fieldwork altogether (Levine et al. 2021). 
As mentioned above, I prematurely concluded my fieldwork with participants in 
response to the pandemic.  
 
One of my participants, Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS), did contract COVID-
19 and then, as previously discussed, developed Long COVID. Seeing the impact of 
COVID-19 on her physical health only encouraged me that the decision to stop data 
collection with participants was the right one. Within the research presented in 
subsequent chapters, there is therefore an imbalance in the representation of 
disabilities, in the number of visits to each site, and in my own observation days at 
each site. As noted in Chapter 6, I had completed five site visits with participants to 
Treasurer’s House as well as five days of ethnographic observation there by the 
onset of the pandemic. However, I had only conducted two site visits with 

189 
 
participants to Barley Hall and two visits to Abbey House by that same point, and I 
had not conducted any ethnographic observations at either site. As explained in 
Chapter 5, I originally tried to find a balance in representing physical chronic 
conditions, neurodiverse conditions, and mental health conditions when recruiting 
participants. In actuality, almost all my participants had a physical chronic condition, 
about half had a neurodiverse condition, and one third a mental health condition. 
Despite this, there was enough data to draw out the conclusions I reached in the 
previous two chapters. If I had been able to fully complete my data collection, further 
themes may have emerged, but I have no doubt that the themes addressed in 
Chapters 8 and 9 would have still been represented. This is because these two 
particular themes were persistent across all types of disabilities and arose at all three 
case study sites, both via my participants and also in discussions with staff 
members.  
 
As the pandemic progressed and museums adjusted and began to re-open, I re-
visited each of my case study sites to see first-hand how they had adapted to the 
changes. I was able to interview staff members at both Abbey House (n=4) and 
Barley Hall (n=2), allowing me to gather the staff-centric data that I had already 
gathered at Treasurer’s House. Unfortunately, I was unable to speak to any staff at 
Treasurer’s House because the site did not reopen until May 2021. Once they finally 
did re-open, no one at the site returned my inquiries. Thus, I was unable to 
determine their views on the COVID-related accessibility changes in the same way 
as I did with staff at Abbey House and Barley Hall. However, as I mentioned in 
Chapter 6, I was able to speak to Dr Heather Smith, Equity Officer for the National 
Trust, about my research. 
 
Additionally, Teagan reached out to me and offered to audit Barley Hall with me to 
give her insights into their COVID-related accessibility changes. As hesitant as I was 
to take any further participants around the sites, she had already contracted the virus 
at the beginning of lockdown (more than a year prior to our Barley Hall visit) and had 
also received both doses of the vaccine, so her risk of contracting the virus was 
extremely low. Although she was not one of my original participants for Barley Hall, 
she had visited the site before the pandemic and was familiar with the experience. Of 
the two original participants who went to Barley Hall with me, Amanda was still at 

190 
 
high risk of exposure due to her heart condition, and I could not get in contact with 
Alfie because his contact details were no longer valid. Teagan, therefore, seemed an 
ideal substitute as she too had a similar physical condition to Amanda and she also 
had dyslexia, just as Alfie did. It was not a perfect solution, but given the extreme 
circumstances, it seemed the best possible course of action. 
 
Obviously, when I began this research, I could not have foreseen these 
circumstances. However, by harnessing the opportunities that these setbacks have 
presented, it has steered me into a new avenue that could not have been predicted. 
The next section explores this unanticipated opportunity, examining how each case 
study site made themselves “COVID secure” and the subsequent impacts of such 
COVID security on the accessibility of the site. I include Teagan’s observations 
throughout the discussion where applicable. 
7.3. COVID-19 and the Heritage Sector. 
Put lightly, the COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the heritage sector. 
Rarely is there research done on COVID-19’s impact that does not mention 
“widespread damage to the Museum industry” (Choi and Kim 2021, 13; e.g., also 
Antara and Sen 2020; Crooke 2020; Guest 2021; Pennisi 2020). As with other 
sectors, heritage professionals were forced to essentially adapt or close permanently 
– but first, they had to brace themselves for the first wave of the pandemic. A 
National Lottery Heritage Fund survey, published in March 2020 during the first three 
weeks of the initial national lockdown, reported “98% of [heritage] organisations had 
been affected… A large part of the impact was financial – loss of revenue was the 
second most frequently reported impact (69%), after cancellation of events (91%)” 
(Guest 2020, 6). A later report from Oxford Economics projected a £3.9bn turnover 
loss for the museums, galleries, and libraries sector (2020, 43). As the pandemic 
progressed, it was clear that the financial situation of many heritage institutions was 
only growing more and more dire. According to a report from the Heritage Alliance, 
“some heritage charities have seen their non-grant income fall by 80-90%” and “46% 
believe they cannot survive for another six months” (The Heritage Alliance 2020, 2). 
Indeed, my case study organisations and sites were not immune to these shocks. 
The JORVIK Group was forced to close two of their five sites (the Richard III 

191 
 
Experience and the Henry VII Experience) until further notice, and Treasurer’s 
House remained closed for the whole of 2020, not reopening until May 2021. The full 
extent of the economic impact of the pandemic is still to be seen, but it is clear that 
the crisis has left the heritage sector profoundly changed. 
 
In addition to the financial implications, new ways of operating had to be developed 
almost instantly. Given that physical sites had to close, the logical choice was a pivot 
to digital engagement, and many organisations rose to the challenge. With more 
people spending time online and on social media (Kemp 2020), museums could 
attempt to stay relevant and in the public eye by transitioning online, something that 
scholars such as Nina Simon have been advocating for years (Simon 2007; Simon et 
al. 2006). Interestingly, Choi and Kim point to this as a natural evolution of the 
museum experience in general (2021, 4):  
The interests of museums have changed from ‘object-based epistemology’ to ‘object-
based discourse,’ and that the introduction of new technology has transformed the 
‘object-centred museums’ into ‘experience-centred museums’. Experience-oriented 
museums have become discovery spaces. Moreover, online museums expand user 
activities. Hence, museums linked to new digital technologies are highly likely to 
develop into user-centred spaces.  
All three of my case study sites are experience-oriented sites, yet none of them 
changed to a fully digital format. That is not to say that the organisations did not 
produce online content during the pandemic, as each of them did, but rather that 
their content was not related directly to these specific sites. For example, Abbey 
House began posting videos introducing new Makaton5 signs to followers (Abbey 
House Museum 2021). Although these videos show a dedication to accessibility, 
they are not related to Abbey House itself, and I therefore do not consider them here. 
For this chapter, I focus on the physical, on-site experience of my case study sites. 
7.4. Re-opening Methodology. 
During the first national lockdown, museums and heritage sites were forced to close 
along with other non-essential places. As restrictions began to be lifted, locations 
                                            
5 Makaton is a sign language system that, unlike BSL, follows the syntactic structure of spoken 
English. It is used by a wide variety of people, disabled and nondisabled alike. It is even taught to pre-
verbal children to give them a way to communicate (Makaton 2021). 

192 
 
had to make themselves “COVID secure” – signalling to visitors that they have taken 
all necessary precautions as outlined by the UK government and Health and Safety 
Executive (Health and Safety Executive 2021). These precautions include: 
• A COVID-19 risk assessment; 
• Cleaning, handwashing, and hygiene procedures; 
• Enabling people to work from home where possible; 
• Maintaining 2m social distancing where possible; 
• Managing transmission risks where social distancing cannot be maintained. 
 
Additionally, face masks were made mandatory inside all public buildings, including 
museums and heritage sites. Exemptions were made for disabled people who were 
unable to put on a mask because of their disability or who would experience “severe 
distress” if they had to wear one (Department of Health and Social Care 2021). 
Although the government created “face mask exemption” cards for people to use as 
a way of explaining their lack of face covering, many people started wearing a 
sunflower lanyard to signify their exemption. A fuller discussion of the sunflower 
lanyard scheme and its use during the pandemic, as well as its implications for the 
disabled community, are discussed in Chapter 9. 
 
In order to comply with the governmental guidelines, many museums – and indeed 
the wider tourism sector at large – had to adapt their pre-pandemic operations. As 
heritage sites grappled with these changes, the UK Disability Arts Alliance published 
their “Seven Principles for an Inclusive Recovery.” Born out of a concern that 
disabled people would be left behind, the principles were designed “to ensure deaf, 
neurodiverse and disabled people are not discriminated against as creative work 
begins again and as venues re-open” (UK Disability Arts Alliance 2021a). In 
summary, the principles are: 
1. All activities must comply with The Equality Act (2010). 
2. The Social Model of Disability is the preferred understanding of disability, and 
therefore organisations should work to remove barriers rather than enforce 
them. 
3. Co-production with disabled people is paramount. 

193 
 
4. Information regarding COVID-19 procedures must be shared with visitors and 
employees alike, particularly disabled visitors and employees, so that they 
may assess their own level of risk.  
5. The visitor journey should be mapped and clearly communicated so that 
disabled visitors may assess their own level of risk. 
6. Disabled artists should be prioritised in new creative projects. 
7. Diversity should be celebrated, and new ways of working and visiting should 
highlight this diversity rather than enforcing older, ableist methods. 
 
The Seven Principles tout themselves as “practical guidance to arts and cultural 
organisations” (UK Disability Arts Alliance 2021a), and have been welcomed by 
many disabled artists (UK Disability Arts Alliance 2021b). Drake Music, a national 
organisation working in music, disability, and technology, writes (Meijer 2020): 
As restrictions change and venues and cultural spaces begin to re-open there is a 
very real concern that Disabled people will once again be forgotten and discriminated 
against, that the ableism engendered by the pandemic will become part of ‘the new 
normal’... We have a unique opportunity here, to recover from COVID as a stronger, 
more inclusive, diverse, creative and welcoming sector. [The Seven Principles] can 
be the roadmap for us all to follow to a better ‘normal’. 
Indeed, the UK Disability Arts Alliance’s website provides a Twitter thread initiated in 
August 2020 using the hashtag “Inclusive Recovery” (UK Disability Arts Alliance 
2021b), with many tweets declaring their support for the discussion and the 
importance of remembering disabled people when creating reopening plans. 
 
In reading through the Principles, many align with the methodology that I have 
designed for my own research. Although this research is not necessarily beholden to 
the Equality Act, I have embedded accessibility and reasonable adjustments into the 
design of my data collection, particularly with my participants. I position disability 
mostly in accordance with the Social Model of disability, as discussed in Chapter 1. 
My research emphasises the voices of my participants with hidden disabilities, 
embracing an emancipatory framework. I believe the visitor journey, especially 
disabled visitors, begins long before they physically enter a heritage site, and thus I 
asked my participants about how they plan and prepare for a visit. The Seven 

194 
 
Principles represent an important framework for an inclusive mindset, particularly for 
long-standing disability advocates. 
 
However, within the Seven Principles, there is limited practical advice, instead 
outlining attitudes that must be in place when considering COVID-19 measures. For 
example, although studies have shown that changing nondisabled people’s negative 
attitudes towards disabled people are not as difficult as perhaps feared (Schitko and 
Simpson 2012; Bizjak et al. 2011; Daruwalla and Darcy 2005), there is no advice in 
the Seven Principles about how to implement these more inclusive, anti-ableist 
attitudes. The only truly practical principles (Principles 4 and 5) involve the 
dissemination of information – but they are rather vague on what information should 
be included. According to 2020 research from VocalEyes, potential visitors could 
“often or always” find relevant access information 38% of the time when they looked 
for it (Cock et al. 2020, 9). This means nearly two-thirds of the time when someone 
needs this information, they are unable to find it. So then what information should be 
included in COVID-19 materials? The Seven Principles are silent on this. 
 
As discussed in Chapter 5, I designed my methodology to enact practical change at 
my case study sites. Although the Seven Principles represent a truly inclusive 
mindset, they lack practicality. I therefore use these principles as a foundation for my 
own framework for analysing the COVID-19 measures put into place at my case 
study sites.  
 
Accordingly, to assess the impact of the COVID-19 measures on the accessibility of 
my case study sites, I examine the following areas: 
1. Dissemination of COVID-19 information (section 6.5.1); 
2. New COVID-19 measures (section 6.5.2);  
3. Alterations due to COVID-19 (section 6.5.3). 
I focus on these three topics specifically to understand the impact of COVID-19 on 
the accessibility of my case study sites, as well as to contrast their new “COVID 
secure" design with what my participants experienced pre-COVID. By focusing on 
these three areas, I demonstrate that accessibility both increased and decreased at 
my case study sites, presenting unique challenges as well as opportunities in 
designing the pandemic-induced changes. In the subsequent sections, I examine 

195 
 
these areas using data from ethnographic observations, interviews with staff 
members, and information from each case study site’s website, as well as Teagan’s 
observations from our visit to Barley Hall. 
7.5. Analysis of COVID-19 Measures. 
Although there are a great number of COVID-19 security measures that are common 
across all three of my case study sites, I must pause to explain the impact of the 
national and local lockdowns on the sites.  
 
In March 2020, the first national lockdown was announced, forcing the closure of 
Abbey House and Barley Hall. Treasurer’s House was already closed but had 
planned to re-open in April, as per their usual seasonal routine. Most employees 
were put on furlough, utilising the Job Retention Scheme in which the government 
would pay a percentage of the employee’s wages (HM Revenue & Customs 2021). 
This lockdown was initially supposed to last 12 weeks, but was extended another 
three weeks. In late June 2020, the first national lockdown was lifted, allowing 
museums to re-open, provided they had COVID-19 measures in place. Both Abbey 
House and Barley Hall reopened, but Treasurer’s House remained closed. 
 
In October 2020, a tier system for local alert levels was introduced in an attempt to 
avoid another national lockdown but to allow for local lockdowns (Walker 2020). At 
the time, neither Leeds nor York were placed into Tier 3, which would require the 
closure of museums. Abbey House and Barley Hall remained open, but Treasurer’s 
House was still closed. 
 
In November 2020, a second national lockdown was announced, set to last for the 
month of November. Once again, all museums were closed and most staff members 
were furloughed. 
 
In December 2020, the second national lockdown was lifted but the local tier system 
was strengthened, meaning that some areas would still remain in lockdown. Leeds 
was designated a Tier 3 area (Leeds City Council 2020), and Abbey House 
remained shut, keeping most staff members on furlough. Barley Hall was able to re-

196 
 
open, but Treasurer’s House remained closed. The first COVID-19 vaccine was 
administered in the UK on 8 December (NHS 2020). 
 
In January 2021, a third national lockdown was introduced, meaning that once again, 
all museums had to shut and most staff members were placed on furlough. A 
vaccination programme began in the UK, inviting people with underlying health 
conditions and older people to receive the vaccine first. 
 
In April 2021, the third national lockdown was lifted, allowing museums to re-open. 
For the first time since December 2019, all three of my case study sites were open 
again, although each had seen significant changes to their visitor experience.  
 
In looking at the timeline of national and local lockdowns, there is an unevenness to 
the openings and closures. For Abbey House and Barley Hall, closures were 
dependent on lockdown restrictions, whilst Treasurer’s House remained closed for 
different reasons altogether. In personal communications with my Thesis Advisory 
Panel member Dr Heather Smith, Equity Officer for the National Trust, she explained 
that the National Trust categorised their indoor properties into “Treasure Houses” 
and “Little Gems,” allowing them to prioritise reopenings. “Treasure Houses” – not to 
be confused with Treasurer’s House – are larger properties with a more significant 
collection, whilst “Little Gems” are locally important but not nationally significant by 
the National Trust’s standards. Treasurer’s House was designated a “Little Gem” 
property, meaning that it was not prioritised for reopening as the National Trust 
worked through the logistics of adapting all their properties to new COVID measures. 
By the end of the third national lockdown, the National Trust was finally confident 
enough in their COVID measures to reopen Treasurer’s House. 
 
The differences in these reopening timelines are significant not only when 
considering the flexibility of the case study organisations, but also when considering 
the impact on my ability to gather data regarding these changes. Because Abbey 
House and Barley Hall stayed open as much as they could, staff members were also 
available for me to interview. Given the pandemic, I did not conduct face-to-face 
interviews until the summer of 2021, but I was able to keep in contact with 
management at both of these sites. However, because Treasurer’s House was 

197 
 
closed for so long, most of their staff were furloughed and therefore unavailable to 
answer any of my enquiries, and this lack of response carried on even when 
Treasurer’s House did eventually reopen. It is unclear to me whether this was due to 
the management no longer being interested in participating in my research or 
because the management had changed over the course of the pandemic. Whatever 
the reason, I have very limited data regarding Treasurer’s House in comparison with 
Abbey House and Barley Hall in the context of COVID-19. Given the sprawling 
structure of National Trust, Heather was unable to provide me with any contact 
details of Treasurer’s House aside from the details I already had. 
 
To collect data about the COVID-related accessibility changes, I surveyed the 
websites for each case study site and visited each site to see the changes for myself 
in June and July of 2021. As mentioned, Teagan reached out and offered to visit 
Barley Hall with me in order to give her perspective on the changes to their site. I did 
not ask any other participants to join me on my site visits as discussed in section 7.2 
above. In addition to my site visits, I interviewed staff members at Abbey House and 
Barley Hall regarding their COVID-related accessibility changes. I then conducted 
structured interviews with management staff at Abbey House and Barley Hall via 
email regarding these changes but also how they expect to re-adapt as the 
pandemic progresses and potentially ends. The questions I asked them can be 
found in Appendix F, as well as my field notes from these interviews.  
7.5.1. Dissemination of COVID-19 Information. 
All three sites provide COVID-19 information on their websites, but the presentation 
of the information varies. On the Abbey House website, they have added a link in the 
main banner to a separate page containing information regarding new COVID-19 
measures. These measures include reduced hours and suggestions for pre-booking 
tickets. There is also further guidance on mask wearing, social distancing, hand 
sanitising, and track and trace information, which I further explain in 7.5.2 below. The 
text is all fairly standard and nondescript; there is little to suggest this is any different 
than any other museum or heritage site. Indeed, looking at the websites for other 
venues in the Leeds Museums and Galleries group, the wording is identical (Leeds 
Museums and Galleries 2021a). A consistent message across all the LMG venues is 
helpful to visitors, as it creates a consistent branding for the group. 

198 
 
 
However, the identical wording also suggests a generalisation of the information, that 
it is not tailored specifically for Abbey House. Surely there are adaptations to Abbey 
House that are not relevant to, for example, Leeds City Museum, another museum in 
the LMG portfolio that is housed in a purpose-built building in Leeds City Centre. The 
two buildings are vastly different, as are the collections housed within. Leeds City 
Museum is a more traditional “white box” museum of natural history whereas Abbey 
House is an experiential museum dedicated to the social history of the 19th century. 
Based on my own experience of white box museums vs experiential museums, I find 
it difficult to believe that a blanket statement regarding COVID-19 measures could 
adequately describe the changes at either site. 
 
On the Barley Hall website, their COVID-19 measures are explained in great detail. 
Where Abbey House is brief and succinct, almost to the point of overgeneralization, 
Barley Hall is detailed and thorough. A case could be made that it is overly thorough, 
but research into accessibility has shown that it is better to provide as much 
information as possible so that people are better equipped to make decisions for 
themselves (Fisher 2017) and indeed, Principle 4 of the Seven Principles makes this 
same point (UK Disability Arts Alliance 2021a). The COVID-19 measures they 
discuss include limited visitor numbers, mandatory mask wearing unless exempt, 
temperature checks upon entry, pre-booking timed entries, Track and Trace 
information, one-way system, social distancing guidance, and even a mention that 
the toilets now have one-touch taps, meaning that the taps turn off automatically and 
visitors do not need to touch them again once they have washed their hands. There 
is also an interesting addition at the end of the information regarding staff: “Our staff 
are ready to help. Barley Hall staff are trained to uphold our safety procedures and 
will be happy to answer any questions or note any suggestions you have” (The 
JORVIK Group 2021b). As well as textual information on the website, there is a 
subtitled video explaining and demonstrating the new COVID-19 measures. Although 
she did not necessarily find the subtitles helpful, Teagan did appreciate the audio-
visual presentation of the information (Appendix D 8.3). 
 
For Treasurer’s House, their website primarily lists what visitors can expect from the 
new guided tour format compared to the previous free-flow style of visit, as well as 

199 
 
how to book tickets (National Trust 2021e). However, they do mention the QR code 
for Track and Trace as well as the suggestion to pre-book tickets. Additionally, there 
is a link to an FAQ page at the bottom of the website. The FAQ is relevant to all 
National Trust properties, not just Treasurer’s House, and again, it primarily answers 
questions regarding ticketing and car parks(National Trust 2021f). As with Abbey 
House, the lack of details in the description makes me question how adequate this 
information is for disabled visitors trying to determine if they can visit or not. Indeed, 
when I showed Teagan this information, she commented that it seemed like the 
standard information everyone was sharing and that it told her little about what to 
actually expect if she visited (Appendix C 8.4). 
7.5.2. New COVID-19 Measures. 
As a requirement for reopening, all three sites have installed signs with Track and 
Trace QR codes for people to “check in” at a site. These QR codes are placed near 
the entrance for visitors to scan in the NHS Track and Trace app (UK Health Security 
Agency 2021). This app was created to “track and trace” exposure to the COVID-19 
virus, and will alert users if they have been exposed and therefore need to isolate 
themselves from others in order to prevent spreading the virus further. The app was 
designed to replace manual entry of names and phone numbers, a legal requirement 
for businesses to aid in tracing COVID-19 virus exposure (UK Health Security 
Agency 2021). If a person cannot use the QR code, their details are still taken 
manually.  
 
Additionally, transparent screens have been installed in the admissions and shop 
areas at all three sites, creating an extra barrier between staff and visitors to reduce 
transmission of the virus. These screens have become ubiquitous across all 
businesses during the time of the pandemic, and many people – staff and customers 
alike – have found them reassuring as a safety measure (Untaru and Han 2021). On 
the other hand, many have also found them a barrier to communication. Jess, a staff 
member at Barley Hall, revealed to me that if the light hits the screen at a particular 
angle, the screen becomes reflective, making it difficult for visitors and staff to see 
each other as they interact (Appendix G 2.1). 
 

200 
 
Perhaps most significantly, all three sites have now instituted caps on how many 
visitors may be inside at a given time to aid in social distancing. At Abbey House, 
there is a maximum of 36 visitors allowed in the building at a time, whilst at Barley 
Hall only eight visitors are allowed in every 30 minutes. At Treasurer’s House, only 
five visitors may book onto a tour slot, with tours running every 15 minutes. 
Interestingly, the limited visitor numbers are a change that staff at both Abbey House 
and Barley Hall approved of. George, a front of house staff member at Barley Hall, 
said the limited numbers make the site feel more like a “home” – appropriately, as 
the site is styled as a medieval townhouse (Appendix G 2.1). Likewise, Dannie, a 
front of house staff member at Abbey House, appreciated how the limited numbers 
meant the crowds are easy to manage, as the site can be very busy one hour and 
very quiet the next. She told me that the number cap – and the new booking system 
– help to even out the flow of visitors to make the site pleasantly busy more 
consistently (Appendix G 1.1). As mentioned above, I was unable to complement this 
information with interviews of staff members at Treasurer’s House in an effort to 
understand how they felt about the COVID-19 changes to the property. 
 
In addition to the above changes, a new position has been added at Abbey House: a 
staff member is positioned at the front door to greet visitors, track the number of 
people in and out of the building, and also to ask visitors to scan the Track and Trace 
QR code. Staff members actually praised this position, saying that it is an excellent 
welcome to the museum. An additional staff member at the entrance also means that 
visitors have an immediate point of contact in the museum instead of winding their 
way through the shop before being greeted by a staff member. A one-way system 
through the museum has also been introduced, particularly noticeable in the 
Victorian street, and signs are placed to show the path for visitors to follow as 
evidenced in Figure 9. 
 

201 
 
 
Figure 9. A sign at Abbey House showing the visitor route. 
 
Like Abbey House, a new one-way system has been instituted in Barley Hall to 
facilitate social distancing. In the original design, visitors essentially double-backed 
on themselves, retracing their steps to leave the way they came in. Obviously, this is 
the opposite of a one-way system, and a separate exit needed to be opened in order 
to allow the proper flow of visitors. To do this, an external door to the Greater 
Chamber has been opened, meaning that visitors now exit in a completely different 
way than they had previously, shown Figure 10.  
 

202 
 
 
Figure 10. The door at Barley Hall that now is used as an exit for visitors. 
 
To assist with the one-way system, Barley Hall has also introduced a handheld map, 
pictured in Figure 11 below, to show visitors the layout of the building as well as the 
flow of the one-way system. In discussing the map with Teagan (Abbey House; 
dyslexia, EDS), she said that overall, the design was accessible for her. It is simple 
and clear, easy to follow, and it did a good job of helping a visitor orient themselves 
in an otherwise very complexly laid out and confusing building. However, she did 
point out that the mix of white-on-black text and black-on-white text is difficult for her 
to read, as her eyes and brain had to adjust between the two, causing her to slow 
down her reading. According to the British Dyslexia Association (2021), dark text on 
a light (but not white) background is preferred. The maps are available to every 
visitor that enters, and there is also a basket upstairs near the exit for people to 
deposit maps if they do not want to keep them. The maps are then re-used, after a 
mandatory quarantine, offering the site an opportunity to be environmentally 
conscious whilst also providing a useful tool to visitors.  
 

203 
 
 
Figure 11. The new map of Barley Hall. 
 
At the Treasurer’s House, the experience has changed significantly with the 
introduction of guided tours through the property. At the end of 2019, Treasurer’s 
House was starting to introduce guided tours of the House during the weekdays, 
using them as a test pilot to see how visitors liked them. Neither myself nor my 
participants ever went on one of these tours, as front of house and management 
staff members alike saw these tours as something that was several years off from 
being implemented, if they were to move to guided tours at all. However, now that 
they have reopened, there is no more free flow experience and only guided tours are 
available, a change that seems to now be standard across the rest of the Trust’s 
“Little Gem” properties.  
 
Running every 15 minutes and lasting for about an hour, each tour was led by a 
volunteer tour guide and had space for only five visitors. Given my decision to not 
risk exposure of my participants to COVID-19, discussed in 7.2 above, I therefore 
went by myself. The tour itself was highly structured, and because of how close 
together the tours started, there was little opportunity to linger in each room. The tour 
guide did ask the group if they had any questions, but no one on my tour asked any 
questions or offered any feedback during the tour (Appendix G 3.1). 

204 
 
7.5.3. Alterations Due to COVID-19. 
Having considered the measures that have been introduced at each of my case 
study sites, I now consider previous elements of the visitor experience that have 
been altered or removed at each site. These are important to consider in order to 
establish how these sites have changed from what my participants experienced. 
 
At Abbey House, all of the interactive elements of the museum – such as colouring 
and craft activities, objects that visitors can handle, and even the children’s soft play 
area – have been taken away to reduce common touch points in the museum. 
Instead, craft packs are available, which are pre-made bags of colouring sheets, 
activity pages, and other small items that would have previously been available on 
craft tables. One of the “rest” jobs for various staff members now is to make these 
bags, meaning that if the museum is quiet, they have implicit permission to work on 
these and do not need to seek permission from their manager. 
 
Much of the first floor is also closed off, as social distancing cannot be maintained 
nor can a suitable one-way system be instituted. This includes the Gallery of 
Childhood, which features toys from the Victorian period through to the present. Staff 
members expressed disappointment but also understanding about this decision, 
saying that it was a very popular exhibition, especially with young visitors (Appendix 
G 1.1). 
 
At Barley Hall, the introduction of the one-way system has meant that some of the 
exhibits had to be adapted and, in some cases, moved entirely. The entrance area 
now is no longer a combined admissions and shop area, but instead an admissions 
area with a curtained off area with benches for visitors to sit on as they watch an 8-
minute subtitled video introducing the site and providing relevant context about the 
setting of the townhouse. This video used to be positioned in the next room, the 
Steward’s Room, which itself has had a slight re-arrange. With the absence of the 
video, the Steward’s Room now has a subtly guided path for visitors to follow, 
immersing them in the medieval experience immediately. The absence of the video 
also means the Steward’s Room is less noisy, meaning there is less distraction as 
people read the text panels in the room. 

205 
 
 
Upstairs, the Greater Chamber has been turned into a gift shop, shown in Figure 12 
below, where a second member of staff is now positioned. This is also where the 
new exit is – to be clear, the door always existed, as did the external staircase, but it 
had been closed off from public use and was generally only used by staff to quickly 
enter and exit the adjacent office area. The exhibition that was originally in the 
Greater Chamber has been moved to the Study, which before was fairly empty. 
Additionally, the Schoolroom, Buttery, and Pantry have been closed off entirely, as 
the areas are too small to ensure social distancing. 
 
Figure 12. The Greater Chamber in Barley Hall now holds a gift shop and the exit to the building. 
 
Like Abbey House, Barley Hall has removed as many interactive elements as they 
can, especially those activities aimed at children. In the Gallery, there was a wand-
making craft where children would decorate sticks with ribbons and gem stickers. As 
Paul T pointed out, it was “a communal activity and encouraged interaction between 
visitor groups” (Appendix G 2.1). In its place, visitors can now book or ask for a free 
crafting pack which includes all the materials needed to decorate a “wand.” There 
also used to be a stamping activity where visitors could pick up a free booklet at the 
admissions desk and stamp pages in their booklet at stations located throughout the 

206 
 
museum. Unfortunately, there is no alternative for this, so the activity has been 
pulled entirely. There are also signs that ask people not to touch items.  
 
In addition to the interactive elements in the exhibition, the sensory packs, discussed 
in Chapter 6, were initially taken out of circulation, as the yellow backpacks they 
came in were difficult to sanitise due to their material. This was an understandable 
measure at first, especially as there was limited time to think of alternatives. 
However, as more time passed, the decision was revisited and it was determined 
that although the yellow backpack was difficult to sanitise, an alternative case could 
be found and cleaning procedures put in place. At Barley Hall, the yellow bags have 
been replaced with hard plastic tool boxes that can be easily wiped down with a 
sanitising cloth, shown in Figure 13 below. All the objects inside can similarly be 
wiped down, and the sensory pack is also put in isolation for three days – 
guaranteeing that any potential COVID-19 virus on the pack and its contents are 
gone before the pack is used by another visitor. 
 
Figure 13. The new sensory pack at Barley Hall in its hard plastic tool box. 
 
As at Abbey House, the staff members commented that the experience has changed 
drastically. Gwen said that she has seen families with smaller children spend about 
5-10 minutes in the building before leaving again, whereas they could spend all day 
in the museum before (Appendix G 2.1). Without the interactive elements, there is 

207 
 
little to hold a young child’s attention, and this is something Jess was deeply 
disappointed in (Appendix G 2.1). There have been no complaints that she was 
aware of, as most visitors are understanding that the pandemic has forced certain 
changes, but she is looking forward to when those interactive elements are brought 
back. It seemed to Gwen that once the pandemic had subsided, or at least once 
restrictions were relaxed, these interactive elements would return. 
 
As with the other sites, any interactive elements that existed at Treasurer’s House 
before the pandemic are now absent. Personal interpretation boards, discussed 
further in Chapter 8, are nowhere to be found, and the tablets that room guides had 
been promised, discussed Chapter 6, are also absent. The only addition in any room 
are some black chairs, ones that are available for people to sit in should they need it 
during the tour, shown in Figure 14.

7.6. Discussion. 
In examining the changes and alterations that have taken place at each case study 
site, it is not readily apparent how the overall accessibility of the sites have been 

208 
 
impacted. Indeed, I argue that accessibility both increased and decreased at the 
sites, which I discuss further below. 
 
In looking at the dissemination of relevant COVID-19 information, all three sites 
include text on their website, but Barley Hall has an additional, subtitled video 
explaining these changes. By using a video, Barley Hall includes an additional layer 
of accessibility into their information, allowing people with text-related disabilities 
(dyslexia, Irlen Syndrome, low vision, etc.) to still access the information. The 
subtitles, too, ensure that people with hearing difficulties can understand what is 
being said in the video. Additionally, the video shows the various new measures in 
context, even including demonstrations of how to interact with these elements. 
Again, this adds other layers of accessibility to the content, showing people who 
have social interaction difficulties (anxiety, autism, etc.) what is expected of them. As 
mentioned in Chapter 6, Barley Hall offers visual/social stories for the same reason: 
to allow people with social interaction difficulties to feel more comfortable during their 
visit, without an overwhelming experience of “newness” making their visit 
uncomfortable. Maggie, a senior management staff member the JORVIK Group, 
explained to me in an interview that the video had been created with accessibility in 
mind, specifically to be a visual/social story in video form. She also expressed a 
desire to produce more videos like this in the future for the other sites within the 
JORVIK Group, but instead of focusing on COVID-19 measures, these future videos 
would introduce each site more generally. In this regard, the pandemic has 
encouraged Barley Hall to reconsider how they communicate with visitors and find 
more accessible options. I discuss in Chapter 10 how Barley Hall management is 
particularly committed to accessibility, and this video further demonstrates such 
commitment.  
 
The introduction of one-way systems at Abbey House and Barley Hall, in my opinion, 
have also had positive impacts on the accessibility of their sites. As will be discussed 
further in Chapter 8, participants at both sites found the original layout of the 
buildings confusing. The newly introduced one-way systems, complete with signs or 
maps, lay out a definitive path for visitors to follow. At Treasurer’s House, the change 
to guided tours has, in my opinion, likewise solved its issues with layout. Participants 
found the original layout confusing whilst staff members bemoaned how visitors 

209 
 
would often become lost within the property (see Chapter 8). But now that all visitors 
are led by a tour guide throughout the property, it seems there is far less confusion. 
Again, the pandemic has unintentionally increased the accessibility of these sites 
through the introduction of new measures.  
 
Limiting visitor numbers at all three sites has also been a boon to accessibility. 
Before the pandemic, it was common for places to engage in special events like 
“Autism Hour,” where numbers were restricted and various sensory inputs, like 
sounds and variable lights, were turned off in an effort to be more “autism friendly” 
(National Autistic Society 2021). Although sites have not necessarily adjusted the 
sensory inputs of their exhibitions for the pandemic, the limited admission numbers 
are critical to a more inclusive museum environment. With fewer visitors inside a 
building at a time, there is less crowding and less overall noise, meaning that people 
with sensory difficulties have less sensory input and are more likely to enjoy their 
visit (Museums + Heritage Advisor 2021a). Interestingly, one participant, Lisa (Abbey 
House; anxiety), shared with me that she preferred to visit museums during their less 
busy times, as she could avoid large crowds (Appendix C 9.4). Indeed, during our 
visit to Abbey House, she avoided areas where there were other groups of visitors. 
When I asked her if she would attend advertised “autism hour” events or even “quiet 
hour” events, she said that she would not, as she “wouldn’t feel it was for me… I feel 
like if there’s something that is for autism, then those people with their carers or their 
families should be able to enjoy that and not feel like they have to share that space 
and be apologetic for outbursts like that so that’s just me being in that they deserve 
that. That’s their time and space” (Appendix C 9.3). Lisa’s hesitancy to use an 
accessibility tool, even one she would find helpful due to her disability, presents an 
interesting conundrum. On one hand, she would benefit from attending these quiet 
hours. On the other hand, she does not identify as autistic or even disabled 
(Appendix C 9.4), and is therefore reluctant to take away accessibility tools from 
people who “deserve” them. But the introduction of caps on the total number of 
visitors at sites resolves this tension. There is no need to advertise quiet hours, as 
the limited numbers mean that every time slot is a quiet time. Yet again, the COVID-
19 adaptations answered an accessibility need that had been overlooked up to that 
point. 
 

210 
 
At each case study site, there are individual adjustments that have added to the 
accessibility of their site. At Abbey House, the introduction of the new staff position at 
the door has been heralded as a good thing by other staff members, and I argue it is 
a good thing for accessibility too. Although I had limited opportunity to observe staff 
members in the role, there is a great amount of potential in having a staff member 
location there. Before the pandemic, the first staff member that a visitor encountered 
was stationed on the opposite end of the shop. In order to approach the staff 
member, a visitor had to wind their way through tables and product displays, 
something that could be difficult for a visitor with mobility problems, wheelchair 
users, and even visitors with pushchairs. Indeed, Teagan, who had a pushchair with 
her when we visited Abbey House, commented that “if I had anything wider than [her 
pushchair], I wouldn't be able to get around” (Appendix C 8.2). Teagan’s observation 
shows that the layout of the shop itself is a barrier to some visitors, meaning they 
must turn back before they even speak with a staff member. However, with a staff 
member positioned at the door, not only can they greet visitors and assist them in 
using the Track and Trace app, but they can also speak to disabled visitors about 
their accessibility needs. During my staff interviews at Abbey House, it was clear that 
front of house staff members are well-versed in the accessibility tools available at the 
site, as well as the barriers of the site. The latter is important, as this information will 
allow a disabled person to decide for themselves whether they can access the 
museum or not.  
 
Additionally, given the generality of the COVID-19 information on the Abbey House 
website that I discussed in 7.5.1 above, the staff member at the door can provide 
more detailed information about the COVID-19 measures throughout the museum, 
again allowing the visitor to choose for themselves whether they are able to access 
the site. Likewise, the potential visitor can also ask questions of the staff member, 
clarifying any information that may have been confusing or vague on the website. 
The staff member can also offer one-on-one assistance to disabled visitors – 
although I did not witness this myself, two staff members at Abbey House excitedly 
shared with me an encounter they had the day previously with a visitor who had 
visual difficulties (Appendix G 1.1). The staff member on the door provided personal 
assistance to the visitor, guiding her through the shop which otherwise would have 
been difficult for her to traverse. The new staff position at the door may have been 

211 
 
introduced as a COVID-19 measure, but it has also increased the accessibility of 
Abbey House. 
 
At Barley Hall, the rearrangement of some of the exhibition has proved to be an 
unexpected boon for accessibility. As described above in 7.5.3, the Steward’s Room 
in particular was altered, with the removal of a video and the rearrangement of some 
furniture, particularly a table placed midway into the room to subtly guide visitors 
around the room, shown below in Figure 15. Not only does the removal of the video 
mean that visitors are immediately immersed in the medieval setting once they cross 
the threshold into the room, but there is also a marked difference in the noise levels 
in the room. Indeed, in relistening to the audio from my site visit with Alfie (Barley 
Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision), the video is so loud that I cannot understand what 
we are saying to each other (Appendix C 2.2), despite being closer to the 
microphone than the video speakers. As with the numbers cap above, this lessened 
sensory input means that neurodivergent visitors may have an easier time focusing 
on the interpretation in the room – particularly, the wall-mounted text panels that 
hang next to where the video originally played.

212 
 
 
At Treasurer’s House, chairs have been added to each room for visitors to sit in, 
should they need to sit during their tour. I discuss seating through the lens of 
communication in Chapter 8, but here I wish to expand upon the importance of these 
chairs. In visiting Treasurer’s House, many participants noted that there were not 
enough places to sit – or more specifically, it was difficult to understand where they 
could sit and where they could not (Appendix C 1.3; 4.3; 5.3; 6.3; 7.3). Multiple 
chairs, benches, and couches are present in each room of Treasurer’s House, but it 
is not always clear which chairs are part of the collection and which are for visitors to 
sit in. As Amy put it: “There are actually loads of places to sit, they're just labelled so 
badly” (Appendix C 4.3). As an example, in one room, there are two nearly identical 
chairs next to each other, shown below in Figure 16 – one is part of the collection, 
whilst the other is a chair that visitors can use. Additionally, nearly every participant, 
regardless of the site they visited or their disability, needed to sit and rest at some 
point during our visit (Appendix D 3.3; 4.3; 5.3; 6.3; 7.3; 8.3). Not being able to 
discern which chair they can sit in is almost as frustrating as having no seating at all, 
according to my participants.  
 
Figure 16. Two extremely similar chairs in a room at Treasurer’s House. The chair on the left is part of the 
collection and cannot be touched. The chair on the right is for visitors to sit in. 
The introduction, then, of these new chairs to Treasurer’s House is a bonus for 
disabled visitors. Shown below Figure 17, these chairs are clearly not part of the 
collection, as they are made of sturdy black plastic and are placed on black stands, 

213 
 
presumably to conserve the flooring beneath the chair. One of these chairs stands in 
each room, meaning that there is always an obvious place for visitors to sit during 
their guided tour, no matter where they are in the property.  
 
Figure 17. A black plastic chair now found in Treasurer's House. 
 
However, James (Treasurer’s House; fibromyalgia) makes a salient point when he 
says “on a busy day in general, because [it is] the sort of attraction that would attract 
the older person who may need to sit down a bit more...I would say that there 
probably wouldn't be enough seats” (Appendix C 6.3). At the moment, only five 
people are allowed on a tour at a time – but given that nearly 20% of the UK 
population has a disability (Office for National Statistics 2015), it is almost 
guaranteed that one visitor on any given tour will have some kind of disability. 
Additionally, older people are more likely to have disabilities as part of the aging 
process (Buhalis et al. 2012), and as James rightly points out, the visitor 
demographics of Treasurer’s House – and the National Trust more widely – tend to 
skew older. Therefore, it is not unrealistic to assume that more than one person on a 
tour could benefit from using a chair. As I was unable to speak to anyone at 

214 
 
Treasurer’s House regarding the decision to include these chairs, I can only 
speculate as to why they only keep one chair in each room. The size of the rooms is 
not prohibitive to more chairs, but given the number of rooms in Treasurer’s House, 
perhaps cost is a consideration. Visitors are guided through at least ten rooms in the 
property, so filling these rooms with chairs could be costly, but I do not find this an 
adequate excuse. In speaking with my supervisor about this, she commented that 
she would not feel comfortable sitting down if there was only a single chair – echoing 
Lisa’s statement about not wanting to take something away from someone who 
needs it more. Indeed, as I went around on my guided tour, I was hesitant to use the 
chair, despite feeling tired after being led through the property and traversing up and 
down two staircases. I was the youngest member of the tour and did not want to 
deprive my older tour members, one of whom walked with a cane, the chance to 
rest. All of this is to say that the property would benefit from having more than one 
chair in each room for visitors to use, but the fact that they have added these chairs 
in the first place is a bonus for the accessibility of their site. 
 
Despite all the positive impacts on accessibility that took place at my case study 
sites due to the pandemic, there are significant negative impacts as well. Most 
obvious is the removal of all interactive media from the sites, citing the need to keep 
touch points to a minimum to prevent the spread of germs and the virus. At Abbey 
House, crafting activities, handheld interpretation text, and objects to handle have all 
been removed. At Barley Hall, crafting activities have been removed and signs have 
been placed asking people to not handle objects. As an additional blow, the sensory 
packs, which had been designed specifically with accessibility in mind, were taken 
out of circulation. At Treasurer’s House, the personal interpretation boards have 
been removed, as well as the visual aids that room guides previously used, such as 
oversized photos and objects that can be handled. Staff members at both Abbey 
House and Barley Hall mourned this particular loss (Appendix G 1.1; 2.1). Both 
Abbey House and Barley Hall sell themselves as immersive experiences, and to take 
away the interactive elements takes away from that immersion. Multiple studies have 
shown that these interactive elements not only add to the overall museum 
experience, but also increase learning and engagement (e.g., Pallud 2017; Haywood 
and Cairns 2006; Feher 1990).  
 

215 
 
Not only that, but also the co-presence of others engaged in the same activity is a 
particularly powerful aspect of the interactive experience. Haywood and Cairns, in 
developing a hypothesis for why interactive exhibitions are so effective for learning 
and engagement, noticed the importance of co-presence (2006, 10-12). Their 
research was centred around children’s engagement and learning at a science 
museum, but their findings are equally relevant to my case study sites, as they frame 
interactive elements of their exhibits as important to learning and engagement. It 
should be noted that there is an important distinction between co-presence and 
collaboration. As Haywood and Cairns (2006, 11) noted, “it emerged that in order to 
adequately conceptualise children’s experience with interactive exhibits it is essential 
to consider the co-presence of others.” The importance of co-presence is something 
that staff members commented upon. Gilly (a front of house staff member at Abbey 
House), in reflecting upon where the crafting table used to be located in Abbey 
House, said that she loved watching children interact with each other and noted that 
the children enjoyed it as well (Appendix G 1.1). Paul T (a front of house staff 
member at Barley Hall) too commented that the wand-making craft activity in 
particular became a communal activity and encouraged interaction between different 
visitor groups (Appendix G 2.1). Without these interactive activities, there is no scope 
for interaction between groups – and therefore, limited potential for significant 
learning and engagement, particularly for younger visitors.  
 
Additionally, studies have also found these interactive elements to be key in terms of 
accessibility (e.g., Allen and Minnion 2020; Shepherd 2009). McMillen (2015, 101), 
for example, discusses the impact of relief printed media that transforms 2D images 
into 3D, textured prints for people to touch. She points to these prints as useful for 
blind visitors, but I posit that the tactile element of these prints is useful for a much 
wider disabled audience, particularly for neurodiverse visitors who learn best through 
touch. Indeed, Eardley et al. agree (2016, 265), saying "the provision of multisensory 
information could enhance the learning opportunity for all visitors." In their research, 
they examine memorability through interactive elements specifically designed for 
disabled visitors. They found that (2016, 283): 
If these museums were both attempting to redefine (dis)ability by producing an 
experience that could be shared and experienced in a way defined by each individual 

216 
 
visitor, by providing information through multisensory means, they are potentially also 
improving the long term memory or impact of the museum visit for all visitors. 
Not only did these multisensory, interactive elements increase accessibility for 
disabled visitors, these same elements also increased memorability for all visitors, 
disabled and nondisabled alike. 
 
Likewise, the removal of the personal interpretation boards from Treasurer’s House 
has negatively impacted the accessibility of the property. Moreover, the design of the 
tour in general, I believe, has negatively impacted accessibility. The tour is delivered 
orally, meaning that visitors like Jessica (Treasurer’s House; dyslexia, Irlen 
syndrome) and Alfie (Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision) need not worry about 
reading text panels, which they find difficult (Appendix C 2.3; 7.3). However, d/Deaf 
people or people with hearing difficulties, attention issues (such as Kasi with her 
ADHD), or audio processing difficulties (a side effect of OCD, which Aaron and Amy 
both have) may struggle to engage with the oral transmission. Additionally, several 
participants mentioned during their interviews that walking at a pace different from 
their own was physically painful. Ellie (Treasurer’s House; anxiety, chronic vestibular 
migraines, depression, fibromyalgia) shared that “walking solidly for 20 minutes 
wouldn't have as big an impact as if I was walking for five minutes, stopping for 10 
minutes” (Appendix C 5.4). Echoing Ellie’s statement, Amy (Treasurer’s House; 
anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) told me “I have to go at the speed that I go, if that 
makes sense. And slowing down and speeding up is painful” (Appendix C 4.3). The 
enforced stop-and-start pace of the guided tours would therefore likely become a 
barrier to Ellie and Amy’s physical comfort if they joined one of these tours, even to 
the point of causing physical pain in them.  
 
Discussed further in Chapter 8, the appeal for my participants of the personal 
interpretation boards at Treasurer’s House was their capacity to be tailored to the 
personal interests of whomever picked the board up. Three different themes were 
discussed in each room, so visitors could pick and choose what they wanted to learn 
about. Additionally, they provided written textual information for people who prefer 
reading. Visitors using the boards could also spend as much time with them as they 
liked, meaning they could walk at their own pace around the room with the boards, 
as Amy and Ellie above mention. Visitors with reading difficulties, such as Alfie 

217 
 
(Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision), Jessica (Treasurer’s House; dyslexia, Irlen 
syndrome), Kasi (Abbey House; ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, EDS), and Teagan 
(Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS), could take their time reading them or bypass them 
altogether. The key to these boards was the flexibility they offered to visitors, 
something that is completely stripped away in the Treasurer’s House guided tour as I 
experienced it. As discussed above in section 7.5.2, the structure of the new tour 
was highly rigid and did not allow for much flexibility or personalisation. 
 
Taking all these adjustments together, I am struck by the fact that many of the 
changes that have negatively impacted accessibility are also the changes that staff 
members are keener to see reversed. The removal of interactive elements has been 
universally seen as a negative – but necessary – move in the eyes of staff members 
at my case study sites. However, in my interviews with Maggie (Barley Hall) and 
Mary (Abbey House), they both expressed the desire for the interactive elements of 
their sites to return as soon as it is deemed safe. At Barley Hall, they also now intend 
to keep the new layout, although they will be less strict on the “one-way” aspect of it 
once pandemic restrictions have been lifted. They likewise intend to keep the maps 
to guide visitors around the site. The accessibility of these three sites has been 
altered, and sometimes negatively so, but the pandemic restrictions have also 
provided numerous opportunities for improved accessibility that can remain in place 
even after the pandemic. 
7.7. Summary. 
Throughout this chapter, I have focused on the impact of COVID-19 on the disabled 
community, particularly people with hidden disabilities. It is not a stretch to say that 
they have been unduly impacted by the changes that the world – and the heritage 
sector more specifically – has undergone. In many ways, my case study sites have 
used the pandemic, sometimes unintentionally, to increase the accessibility of their 
sites, although they have also necessarily had to decrease accessibility in certain 
areas at the same time. Whereas the original COVID-19 changes were decided and 
implemented without input from visitors or staff members, my case study 
organisations have now had the opportunity to listen to feedback and to act 
accordingly upon it as they did at Barley Hall. As the world continues to adjust to the 

218 
 
ongoing pandemic, these measures will likewise need to adjust, and by listening to 
disabled visitors, my case study sites can ensure a more inclusive visit for everyone. 
 
 
 

219 
 
Chapter 8 – Active vs Passive 
Accessibility. 
 
"Oh, I really like these!" Amy (anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) whispers as we 
walk around the West Sitting Room of the Treasurer's House. Compared to 
other rooms in the house, it's rather small, almost intimate in size – except for 
the giant fireplace that takes up nearly an entire wall. But it's not the fireplace 
that Amy is commenting on, it's a set of ebony wood chairs with small inlaid 
eyes along the back, shown in Figure 18. It's exactly the kind of quirky thing 
that Amy would have in her home. "Can you just imagine? People leaving a 
dinner party and all they keep saying is 'the chairs have eyes!’” 
 
Figure 18. An ebony wood chair with ivory inlaid eyes at Treasurer’s House. 
 

220 
 
As we chat further, Amy comments that she's not sure if she could touch the 
chairs themselves, just to see what the eyes felt like. This is, after all, the 
National Trust, where everything is on open display but there's still an air of 
"do not touch" hanging over everything. Amy would rather not risk the ire of 
the room guides by touching and potentially damaging a priceless, one of a 
kind artefact. 
 
"They actually just introduced a touch tour," I offer. As someone who also has 
anxiety, I fully understand her concern. Most people understand museum 
admonitions to stay hands off as a conservation concern, which it primarily is. 
One person touching an object for a split second may not damage the item, but 
if every visitor touches the object, however delicately, it will become damaged 
over time. To a person with anxiety, though, it doesn't matter that it is this 
build-up of handling that damages the object. An anxious brain automatically 
goes to the worst possible case, no matter how ridiculous. In the case of our 
chair, Amy is worried that if she touches the chair, it will instantly crumble into 
dust and she'll receive a life-long ban from all National Trust properties. To be 
clear, every part of Amy's scenario would not happen, but that doesn't matter to 
her brain. Anxiety takes this extremely unlikely, worst-case scenario and turns 
it into an absolute certainty. 
 
"Oh really? Where is it?" Amy looks delighted by the opportunity to actually 
touch historical objects. 
 
"They keep it on the reception desk – you just have to ask for it." 
 
"Oh." Amy's face immediately falls. I ask her why she has that reaction. "I just 
hate asking for things. I don't want to bother anyone.” 
 
 
 

221 
 
Amy's dislike of requesting things perfectly exemplifies a large problem surrounding 
accessibility tools: people have to ask for them. Large print guides, braille guides, 
transcripts, magnifying glasses – these are all small, easily created or purchased 
items that are often kept behind the admissions desks at museums. By making 
visitors request these accessibility tools, rather than embedding them within the 
design of an exhibition, sites have turned these tools into an “active” accessibility 
measure. 
 
The notion of active and passive accessibility is still finding its roots in disability 
studies, but it is a long-standing concept in the world of transportation (e.g., Coppola 
and Silvestri 2018; Lättman et al. 2018; Cascetta et al. 2016, 2013). Simply put, 
active accessibility describes an individual moving from zone to zone in order to 
achieve a particular goal, while passive accessibility describes the amount of 
opportunities (or hindrances) to achieve a goal in a particular place. Active 
accessibility is person based, while passive accessibility is location based.  
 
When these concepts are transferred to disability studies, active accessibility can be 
seen as a disabled individual navigating barriers as they go about their lives. For 
example, someone with arthritis may have to navigate stairs, curbs, and crowded 
shelves in order to cross the street and buy some milk from the corner shop. Passive 
accessibility, on the other hand, describes the various methods of buying that same 
carton of milk. The person with arthritis can choose between stairs or a lift, between 
going to the shop or ringing a friend up to get it for them, or even ordering the milk 
online to have it delivered to their door.  
 
Active vs passive accessibility also has parallels in the medical and social models of 
disability, which I discuss more thoroughly in Chapter 1. In the medical model, which 
focuses on the 'deficiencies' of an individual, a disabled person has to adapt to the 
world. Active accessibility echoes this, as it focuses on the individual moving through 
the world. The social model of disability, however, highlights how society creates 
unequal opportunities and therefore disables a person. Likewise, passive 
accessibility concentrates on the environment and how it helps or hinders a person.  
 

222 
 
In terms of museums and heritage, active and passive accessibility are useful 
concepts; however, it is slightly more complicated than person-focused or place-
focused. Museum experiences are, by their very nature, both person-focused and 
place-focused. It is arguably the combination of a person in a specific place that 
allows the museum experience to arise. Admittedly, work is being done on off-site 
virtual heritage experiences and became increasingly popular during the COVID-19 
pandemic (Kist 2020; Samaroudi et al. 2020), but for the sake of my research, I 
focus on in-person museum visits, and therefore, the interaction between people in a 
specific place. Active and passive accessibility must then be understood in terms 
other than person-focused and place-focused.  
 
I divide active and passive accessibility in terms of gatekeeping: if a visitor must ask 
for something, such as the touch tour mentioned in the vignette above, this act of 
asking represents a form of active accessibility. Examples of such active accessibility 
include temporary ramps that must be put up or taken down by a staff member, or a 
Braille guide that is kept behind the admissions desk. Passive accessibility tools, on 
the other hand, are either built into the exhibition design, such as dyslexia-friendly 
fonts or automatic subtitles on videos, or out in the open for anyone to use, such as 
a bench to sit on or an automatically opening door.  
 
I argued in Chapter 1 that both the medical and social models of disability have their 
uses. I likewise argue that both active and passive accessibility are useful in 
museums. There are a number of reasons why a museum may choose to take an 
inherently neutral tool, like the touch tour, and make it active. For instance, as Ellen 
from Treasurer's House explains in her interview, they chose to keep the touch tour 
behind the desk and only give it to people who ask for it in order to limit the damage 
to these touchable items. Through negotiations with the conservation team, they 
identified different objects that could be handled on occasion, but they would prefer 
to err on the side of caution and only allow people access to the tour who, as she put 
it, would truly benefit from the experience. How they determined who would benefit 
from the touch tour is left vague and open to interpretation, but they do not want 
every person walking through the property to touch each of those items. With this in 
mind, it is clear that sometimes an active accessibility tool is the best compromise 
between conservation and access, according to a particular organisation. 

223 
 
 
Although active accessibility certainly has its place in museums, passive accessibility 
is more helpful overall for visitors. As Amy said above, she dislikes asking people for 
things, which prevents her from using any of the active accessibility tools a museum 
may have (Appendix C 4.2). In her case, asking for something is difficult due to her 
disability. For others, it is a public admission of a disability, one that they may not 
wish to announce. Additionally, many people may find specific accessibility tools 
useful, such as ear defenders or visual stories, but the very fact that these tools are 
labelled as "accessibility tools" prevents them from being used. Some people 
eschew using them as they do not want to be identified as "disabled.” Even amongst 
my participants, who were selected for their experiences of having a hidden 
disability, not everyone identified as disabled. Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety), when I 
asked if she identified as disabled, simply said she did not (Appendix C 9.4), and 
Amanda (Barley Hall; heart failure, psoriatic arthritis) even noted that her reluctance 
to use a cane or walker was "a bit of pride in me at the moment” (Appendix C 3.1). It 
stands to reason that in the wider population, a similar attitude would manifest in a 
number of people, meaning that they would be reluctant to ask for these accessibility 
tools regardless of how useful they might find them.  
 
Even for those who do identify as having a disability, they may not wish to take away 
an accessibility tool from someone who may need it more. Recall in Chapter 7 how 
Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety) did not want to crowd “quiet hours,” understanding them 
to be primarily focused on autistic visitors and their families (Appendix C 9.3). It 
should be noted that Lisa herself acknowledged that having fewer people in the 
museum whilst she visited would have helped her enjoy her visit more, yet she still 
feels that she should not take away a resource from someone who was "more 
deserving." Having passive accessibility tools means that more people can utilise 
them without having to "out" themselves as disabled, without having any stigma 
attached to using an accessibility tool, and without using up a limited resource that 
someone else may also benefit from. 
 
This chapter examines three elements that repeatedly proved challenging to my 
participants during their site visits: layout, lighting, and communal reading. Each of 
these challenges is explored through a selection of vignettes and quotes from my 

224 
 
participants, as well as observations made during my ethnographic study of the sites 
and interviews with staff and management from the case study organisations. From 
there, I discuss passive accessibility measures that have been suggested by my 
participants and in some cases, introduced at the sites to address these barriers. 
Finally, I review future plans the sites have regarding these three challenges and 
potential passive accessibility measures to mitigate them.  
8.1. Layout. 
 
"Sorry, which way to the café?" 
 
I’m standing in the entrance hall, off to the side of the reception desk. This is 
where visitors to the Treasurer’s House enter, pay their admission or flash their 
National Trust membership card, and are welcomed into the site. The room 
itself dates to the early 17th century, though many of the features of the room 
were added in subsequent centuries (National Trust 2000, 4). In a way, this 
room is representative of the Treasurer’s House as a whole: a centuries-old 
space that has changed and adapted over time, complete with a personal Frank 
Green twist. Green, the famed final owner of the House who gifted it to the 
National Trust, changed the windows and raised the fireplace, the central 
feature of the room (National Trust 1978, 10). There are four entrances to the 
room, though one is blocked off. The visitor asking for directions has just 
entered from the north-western entrance, marked with a star on the map in 
Figure 19.   

225 
 
 
Figure 19.  A map of the admissions area of Treasurer’s House (scan taken from National Trust 1978). 
"Oh, it's just this way, down the stairs and through the shop." The admissions 
staff member, Jay, points to the north-eastern doorway, a doorway which is 
hidden to the visitor from their position and marked by a circle on the map in 
Figure 19 above. The host is all smiles as the apologetic if confused visitor 
heads down the stairs, but once the visitor is out of earshot, they turn to me 
with an exasperated expression on their face. "That happens ALL the time! We 
give them directions when they first enter, but either they're not paying 
attention or they've forgotten or whatever. It's so frustrating!" 
 
To be fair to the lost visitors, Treasurer's House has a confusing layout. Just 
like the entrance hall, the interior has changed multiple times during its 
lifetime, and before its current iteration, it was three separate apartments – 
something that shows in the arrangement of rooms. Curious as to whether the 
layout really is an issue, I begin my own unofficial observations. I position 
myself in the Gallery, overlooking the Great Hall where I can watch the action 
below. In a span of 30 minutes, 24 people came through the Great Hall. Of 
those 24 people, 7 people ask for directions or clarification on the layout – and 

226 
 
3 of those 7 people have to ask multiple times, as they became turned around 
and confused again6. 
 
 
 
Like the visitors above, my participants found the layout of Treasurer's House 
confusing. Both Ellie (Treasurer's House; anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, 
depression, fibromyalgia) and Amy (Treasurer's House; anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) 
mentioned that they would have preferred some kind of suggested route through the 
House (Appendix C 5.3; 4.3). Although neither specifically mention their anxiety as 
an underlying cause for this desire for a suggested route, it is interesting to note that 
they share the condition. The desire for an “official” route was also brought up by 
another participant, Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety), who did specifically link it to her 
anxiety: “For someone who has anxiety, it's just not very clear where [I should go]” 
(Appendix C 9.3). The clarity – or lack thereof – of a path meant that her enjoyment 
of the visit was overshadowed by the need to make the “right” decision regarding 
where to go within the museum. Amy (Treasurer's House; anxiety, hypermobility, 
OCD) echoed this sentiment, saying “I enjoy not having to make any decisions 
[regarding where to go] and I enjoy [visiting a place] where I can make sure that I 
see everything that the museum wants me to” (Appendix C 4.3). There is a certain 
level of comfort in having a prescribed route, one that allows a more relaxed visit for 
Amy and Ellie and potentially many more visitors to Treasurer's House. 
 
Visitors to Barley Hall encounter a similar issue in the layout of the building. 
Originally built sometime in the 14th century, Barley Hall has changed from a 
monastic hostel to a goldsmith’s mansion to interconnected dwellings and workshops 
to its current iteration as an immersive museum (York Archaeological Trust 2011, 6-
10). Like Treasurer's House, several disparate and altered apartments were 
individually bought up and recombined to fit the vision of the building’s current owner 
(York Archaeological Trust 2011, 12; National Trust 1978, 6). The building itself even 
stretches over a small public right of passage, labelled as “snicket through hall” on

the map, further confusing the arrangement of the building. Also, like Treasurer's 
House, a visitor must double back through previously visited areas in order to 
experience the entire museum, as shown in the map below in Figure 20.  
 
 
Figure 20. Barley Hall guide map (scan taken from York Archaeological Trust 2011). 
 
Most of my participants want to visit the whole museum during our site visit, and it is 
understandable that there is frustration regarding the layout of the sites. This is 
particularly true of Barley Hall, where nearly a third of the building is accessible only 
by one easily missed doorway, shown in Figure 21 below. Alfie (Barley Hall; 
dyslexia, monocular vision) and Amanda (Barley Hall; heart failure, psoriatic arthritis) 
both mention that they nearly missed that entire section of the building, citing the 
“odd layout” (Alfie – Appendix C 2.3) and how “it didn’t flow from one [area] to the 
other” (Amanda – Appendix C 3.3). A similar problem arises at the other two sites as 
well: very often, participants are unclear if they have seen the whole museum, as 
there are no apparent signs or maps to guide them from one area to another. 

228 
 
 
Figure 21. The door, indicated by the arrow, nearly missed by my participants leading to another area of Barley 
Hall. 
 
To clarify, Barley Hall did offer a map of their site pre-pandemic – however, it is 
located inside a guidebook that is available for purchase when the visitor pays their 
admission. None of my Barley Hall participants opts to purchase the guidebook, and 
Amanda (Barley Hall; heart failure, psoriatic arthritis) points out that she would not 
have been able to carry the guidebook around with her anyway, due to her disability 
(Appendix C 3.3). In this sense, there is a gate-keeping aspect to the map. It is only 
available to people with the fiscal and physical means to purchase and carry the 
guidebook, which could be construed as discriminatory. Treasurer's House relies on 
volunteer room guides to answer questions for visitors who may be lost, but room 
guides at Barley Hall are very rare. Even when they are available, they are generally 
stationed in the Great Hall or the Gallery, and their primary responsibility is to offer 
interpretation of that room. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was 
unable to interview any volunteers at Barley Hall nor was I able to observe them. 
 
Interestingly, Barley Hall does have a wall hanging that could be used as a map of 
the building on display, shown in Figure 22 below. However, the wall hanging is 

229 
 
located not at the beginning of the museum, but rather in the corner of the second 
room on the visitor route. It is also not entirely clear that it can be used as a 
directional diagram, especially since it describes the phasing of the building. None of 
my participants even notice the wall hanging, let alone use it to clarify their route. 
 
Figure 22. A wall hanging in Barley Hall that shows the phasing of the building. It could be used as a map of the 
building. 
Abbey House has a similarly confusing layout. The building includes many phases of 
construction – the café, for example, dates back to the 12th century when it was the 
gatehouse for Kirkstall Abbey (Leeds Museums and Galleries 2020a), which now 
stands across the road, and is also the inspiration for the café’s name, the 
Gatehouse. Other parts of the building have been built in subsequent centuries, and 
it is clear that this is a converted building, rather than one that is purpose-built to be 
a museum. In that regard, it is an interesting departure from the other two case study 
sites. Barley Hall and Treasurer's House are both listed buildings from previous 
centuries, but the interpretation within each site is related to the century that it was 
built. Barley Hall is a medieval townhouse and presents itself as such. Treasurer's 
House was redesigned by Frank Green, and so puts that aspect of its history at the 
forefront. Abbey House is a mix of different periods, but is primarily focused on 19th 
century social history. To that end, there is a recreated Victorian Street that takes up 

230 
 
most of the ground floor. Visitors are encouraged to explore the street before they 
travel to the first level where more traditional, although still immersive, exhibits are 
housed. However, like many real-life Victorian streets, the exhibit has several smaller 
alleyways to explore, as well as a number of shops that visitors may enter or travel 
through to another part of the street. The effect of all these alleyways and shops is 
that the street as a whole is maze-like, making it very easy for a visitor to get turned 
around.  
 
This is, in fact, precisely what happened with my participants. Kasi (Abbey House; 
ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, EDS) has a particularly difficult time finding her way 
around in general, saying “I lose direction very easily and don't have the best spatial 
awareness. This can mean that without a map I either get lost or have no idea where 
I have or have not been in an area” (Appendix C 8.3) Teagan (Abbey House; 
dyslexia, EDS) echoes that sentiment: “Without the maps [being available], I think we 
weren't able to target places we wanted to see as well” (Appendix C 8.3). In an 
earlier interview, Teagan mentions that, because of their EDS, it is very important to 
her and Kasi to sort of ‘pre-plan’ their visit, making a note of which exhibits they want 
to see most (Appendix C 8.1). They have limited amounts of energy, as well as 
limited mobility, so prioritising exhibits is a necessity for them to have a successful 
visit. Without a map being available, they are unsure not only which exhibits are 
available, but which ones they want to see the most.  
 
A lack of directions also means that visitors rely on interaction with staff members to 
receive directions. As highlighted in Amy’s vignette at the very beginning of this 
chapter, many people feel uncomfortable asking for this information or additional 
help. Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety) provides an interesting example. She is very 
familiar with Abbey House; her partner is one of its curators, and yet she still finds 
the layout of the museum confusing. Additionally, she expresses gratitude at how 
enthusiastic and helpful the staff members are, but she still feels anxiety over her 
presence at the museum: “I get self-conscious just because I know them and they’re 
probably thinking ‘what is she doing?’” (Appendix C 9.3) As mentioned in the vignette 
that began this section, an anxious brain, particularly one that is sensitive to social 
anxiety, will assume the worst possible outcome of a scenario, and often means that 
the person with anxiety will avoid social interactions, thus making person-based 

231 
 
forms of information inaccessible to them. It is not only general anxiety that can 
cause this heightened concern, but a wide variety of neurodivergent conditions, such 
as Autism, and chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, also can trigger anxiety disorders 
within a person.  
 
Additionally, Lisa and Amy’s experiences are contingent on staff members being 
present to answer these questions. As mentioned, Barley Hall has only one staff 
member positioned in the admissions area, which serves as both the entrance and 
exit (in pre-pandemic times). As such, if a visitor becomes lost or turned around, it is 
up to them to find their way out. Granted, Barley Hall is considerably smaller than 
either Abbey House or Treasurer's House, and in the original design of the museum, 
visitors will naturally retrace their steps in order to return to the admissions area. But 
still, there is a sense that the visitor is “on their own” once they leave the admissions 
area – both a blessing and a curse, it would seem, depending on what a visitor 
wants. 
 
It should also be noted that this confusion regarding the layout presents itself across 
all types of conditions and disabilities. Dyslexia (Vidyasagar and Pammer 2010) is 
known to affect a person’s spatial awareness, while ADHD (NHS 2021b) makes it 
difficult for someone to listen to a list of directions. Many mental illnesses, including 
anxiety (Cassidy et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2008; Sinoff and Werner 2003) and 
depression (McFarland and Vasterling 2018; Sapolsky 2001), can cause varying 
levels of memory loss, but especially short-term memory loss. Additionally, many 
people (myself included) have an auditory processing disorder (NHS 2021c), which 
means that they cannot fully process directions or instructions that are only given 
verbally. Memory decline (Small 2002) is also a natural part of growing older. All of 
these conditions can lead to difficulty remembering a series of directions. Not only 
that, it is perhaps the sign of a good visit that visitors become lost in their experience 
and forget mundane details such as the directions they were given when they first 
entered the building. It is therefore unfair of our unnamed reception host mentioned 
at the start of this section to blame visitors for getting turned around. 

232 
 
8.2. Lighting. 
 
"Oh wow, that's... quite a difference," Alfie says as we walk into the Great 
Chamber in Barley Hall. Alfie, who has dyslexia and monocular vision, is 
particularly sensitive to lighting levels in rooms. It has a massive impact on 
how well he can read, given that he has limited vision to begin with as well as a 
learning difficulty. Throughout our visit, we’ve been discussing the various text 
panels and how well he can read them. It’s almost become a game for us by 
now, having me guess if a panel is easy or difficult for him to read as well as 
discussing what minor differences might be causing the discrepancy. 
 
However, in this particular case, I have no doubt which panel is easier for Alfie 
to read and why.  
 
Figure 23. Two wall-mounted text panels hang side by side at Barley Hall, but with vastly different lighting levels 
on them. 

233 
 
 
Two large text panels hang side by side in the Great Chamber, with similar 
layouts but identical materials, font styles and size, and where decorations were 
placed. Despite the similarities, the lighting levels are vastly different, and 
therefore Alfie's ability to read them is vastly different as well. His dyslexia 
and low vision make it difficult to read even the well-lit panel. As he put it, "I 
can stand here reading it, but I'll enjoy things and the place less." 
 
The room in general is rather dark, lending a spooky atmosphere to an exhibit 
that has been set up to look like a medieval alchemist's lab. Amongst the 
objects themselves, there aren't many smaller text panels aside from small signs 
pleading to "not interfere with the experiments" – essentially, a themed "do not 
touch" sign that is remarkably rare at Barley Hall. However, two walls are lined 
with large text panels explaining the wider context of magic and science in the 
medieval era. If a visitor wants any amount of explanation about the strange 
apparatuses that are piled on the table, they must read these larger text panels.  
 
And that is precisely the problem that Alfie has – due to the low light in the 
room, he can't read the panels easily, and doesn't want to bother even trying7. 
 
 
 
Participants and staff members alike consistently comment on lighting conditions at 
all three sites. However, opinions are starkly divided: for some people, they enjoy the 
lowered lights, as they add to the overall atmosphere and experience. At Treasurer's 
House, for example, many people, both visitors and staff members alike, comment 
that they enjoy the lowered lights of the Blue Drawing Room as part of the temporary 
Christmas decorations. Parts of the room display are seen below in Figure 24 and 
Figure 25, showing the low lighting level. This is an intentional decision on the part of 
                                            
7 As mentioned in Chapter 6, I sent each vignette to the appropriate participant in order to ensure I 
captured their thought process and feelings accurately. Each has been included in this thesis with 
their approval. 

234 
 
the curatorial staff, as they are “setting a scene” to mimic walking into a room 
immediately after the end of a party. Small touches, such as empty champagne 
glasses and bottles (see Figure 24) on the floor, add to this atmosphere, and it is a 
very popular decision amongst my participants who have experienced it.

of a party. 

235 
 
 
Figure 25. A Christmas tree set up in the Blue Drawing Room in the Treasurer's House. The lighting in the room 
has been lowered to emphasise the fairy lights on the tree. 
In this case, the lowered lighting adds to the overall ambiance of the room, allowing 
people to slip into the scene that the curators have created and therefore more easily 
experience this historical, if fictional, moment. As Jessica (Treasurer's House; 
dyslexia, Irlen syndrome) points out, “people do go to these kinds of places because 
they want to kind of step through history and stuff like that” (Appendix C 7.3). 
 
Additionally, some participants feel more comfortable in these low light areas. Amy 
(Treasurer's House; anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) and Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety) 
both comment that they generally prefer darker environments, as they “find it more 
calm and neutral” (Amy – Appendix C 4.3) and it makes them feel less “wobbly” (Lisa 

236 
 
– Appendix C 9.3). They specifically cite harsh, bright lighting as being disorientating 
and distracting to them, so these dimmer areas provide relief from the artificial lights 
of other, brighter areas. 
 
However, many people find the lighting a hindrance to their experience. As Alfie 
(Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision) simply describes, “it's very hard to read 
anything” (Appendix C 2.2). However, the lights are a hindrance to more than 
reading: some details of items on display are lost in the dim lights. When visiting the 
Queen’s Room at Treasurer's House, a room guide pulls out a small torch to show 
James (Treasurer's House; fibromyalgia) and me the intricacy of the inlaid cabinets 
in the room, shown in Figure 26. There is an interesting dichotomy here: on one 
hand, Treasurer's House does not want to raise light levels in order to conserve the 
collection, yet they provide small LED torches in each room to better illuminate the 
collection. Providing torches shows that they know the light is too low for some 
details to be seen, yet they insist they cannot raise the lights due to conservation 
concerns.  
 
Figure 26. Close up of inlaid cabinet at the Treasurer's House, with a room guide shining a torch on the detail. 
 

237 
 
It is clear that the lighting has a significant, negative impact on the experience of 
most participants. This negative impact is particularly true for participants with 
disabilities that affect their reading ability, such as dyslexia or low-level vision. As 
Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS), Kasi (Abbey House; ADHD, dyslexia, 
dyspraxia, EDS), and I discuss in a later interview, a dyslexic brain already has to 
work harder to read text than a neurotypical brain, but the addition of low lighting 
makes the task even more difficult and laborious (Appendix C 8.4). This hindrance 
seemed particularly related to reading, as Alfie (Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular 
vision) pointed out: “I can see what things are, I can't tell where they are. It doesn't 
matter so much, the details” (Appendix C 2.2). So long as details were unimportant 
and reading was not required, the low lighting was fine to most participants. 
However, it is highly doubtful that most heritage practitioners would agree that details 
or text are an unimportant aspect of the general museum experience.  
 
Beyond an inconvenience, the lighting actually presents a physical danger to some 
participants. For Amanda (Barley Hall; heart failure, psoriatic arthritis), who earlier in 
our visit admits that she is slightly unsteady on her feet, having low light levels 
means that she could far more easily trip on something. “There were some places 
where I couldn't quite see and also you know, I like to see into a room – I have 
difficulty stepping into a room, so I do quite like to see what I'm stepping into” 
(Appendix C 3.3), she says. Additionally, Barley Hall has uneven floor surfaces in 
some parts, as the museum is a re-creation of a medieval townhouse and therefore 
includes re-creations of the flooring. There are also tall thresholds in the doorways of 
several of the rooms, shown in Figure 27, creating further trip hazards. The 
thresholds are historically accurate, as they stretch along the length of the building 
and hold the building itself together, making them structurally essential. These 
thresholds make an interesting point for interpretation, but they also make the 
building inaccessible to many people with mobility difficulties. When the uneven 
surfaces and thresholds are combined with extremely low light levels, certain visitors, 
like Amanda, merely peer into a room rather than entering it and risking a fall. 
 

238 
 
 
Figure 27. Tall thresholds in the doorways between rooms at Barley Hall prevent level access and also create a 
trip hazard. 
 
It is not merely immediate physical dangers that are concerns for visitors; in some 
cases, low lighting lead to longer lasting side effects. Ellie (Treasurer's House; 
anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, depression, fibromyalgia) explains that certain 
types of lighting as well as the varying light levels could trigger one of her chronic 
vestibular migraines. She comments (Appendix C 4.1): 
Because it's a migraine trigger, it's something that I might not necessarily realise at 
the time, because it's kind of like an ambient issue. If it was getting to a point where I 
was like, I can't sit up anymore, I know that I could go and sit in the café or 
something, but the lighting is a bit harder to escape.  
Our visit thankfully did not trigger a full migraine, but the potential for a migraine had 
been there, and it would have a significant impact on her activities outside of our 
museum visit.  

239 
 
 
Unfortunately, for one participant, physical side effects did accompany our visit. 
Jessica (Treasurer's House; dyslexia, Irlen syndrome) mentions a particular display 
in one of the rooms (Appendix C 7.3):  
The room when they had the ship in the middle of it [the Court Room], that was really 
dark. I just didn't really bother reading anything in there because it was just giving me 
too much of a headache.  
Her headache comes from the combination of her disabilities: her dyslexia makes it 
difficult to read to begin with, so the low lighting strains her eyes and brain even 
more, while her Irlen syndrome causes her brain to interpret the light signals 
differently. With all these factors combine, Jessica leaves the museum tired, in pain, 
and feeling she has not had a meaningful experience, hardly the outcome museums 
hope to create (Appendix C 7.4). 
 
Interestingly, many participants express a concern for the well-being of others in 
regards to the lighting as well. Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety) earlier mentions that she 
likes the lower lighting of the Victorian street, but she also admits “for anyone with 
any visual impairment, that would be quite dark” (Appendix C 9.3). Likewise, Jessica 
(Treasurer's House; dyslexia, Irlen syndrome) encourages museums to increase 
their lighting levels, saying (Appendix C 7.3): 
I imagine that people would rather be able to see than not see at all, so even the 
addition of just some lighting would be beneficial for me [and also] a lot of people... 
There's quite a lot of older people in there and I can't imagine that they have perfect 
20/20 vision.  
Both Lisa and Jessica acknowledge that the museum experience is not merely 
centred around them and their needs, but also the needs of other visitors to the 
museum. Lisa may find the lower lighting comforting, but she is aware that her 
preference is at odds with the accessibility needs of other visitors. On the other 
hand, Jessica prefers brighter lights, citing her disability, but also acknowledges that 
visitors with other disabilities would find brighter lighting levels beneficial as well. 
 
Harkening back to Ellie, Jessica, and Amanda’s comments above, there is a 
suspicious trend here that favours the wellbeing of the material assemblage over the 
wellbeing of the visitors. As previously described, Amanda and Ellie both are 

240 
 
concerned over the potential for injury during their visits, while Jessica in fact leaves 
the museum with a headache. However, when confronted with a request for brighter 
lights, organisations often cite conservation concerns as a reason to keep lights low 
or a desire to provide an “authentic” experience. Indeed, when room guides at 
Treasurer's House are asked about the lighting, they invariably provide one or both 
of these responses (Appendix D 4.2; 5.2; 7.2). If this is the case, the low lighting 
necessarily prioritises the collection and ambiance over the health and safety of the 
visitors, let alone their enjoyment. This prioritisation calls into question the entire 
point of these museums – do they exist to preserve a collection, or do they exist to 
engage the public with the past? National Trust claims to be “for everyone” (National 
Trust 2021c), but multiple participants leave Treasurer’s House feeling unfulfilled 
(Appendix C 5.3; 7.3). YAT wants to “build better lives through heritage” (York 
Archaeological Trust 2021) but how can they when visitors to their attractions cannot 
engage with the heritage interpretation they present? LMG’s aim to use their 
collection “as inspiration for education, entertaining, and inspiring the people of 
Leeds and beyond” (Leeds Museums and Galleries 2021b) rings hollow when they 
create environments that lead to visitors tripping and falling during their visit. 
 
In addition to the conservation issue, the National Trust is also committed to lowering 
energy consumption at their sites (National Trust 2021d). The Trust is mindful that 
many of their properties, including Treasurer's House, are old buildings and therefore 
require large amounts of energy to operate, so they are committed to finding low-
energy solutions. Ellen told me that the Treasurer's House was planning on 
introducing brighter, lower energy LED bulbs in two rooms during the Spring of 2020 
(Appendix G 3.4). Once again, due to the pandemic, it is unclear on the status of 
these light bulbs. It is also unclear during my visit in July 2021 whether they have 
been installed, as the ambient light from the windows is much greater than it had 
been during my winter visits in 2019. 
 
However, it is not only the level of light that is an issue but the positioning of these 
lights as well. Abbey House in particular has issues with such positioning, as Kasi 
(Abbey House; ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, EDS) repeatedly points out during our 
visit. In one ‘shop’ on the Victorian Street, a bright spotlight is placed near the 
doorway. It allows people in the shop to see better, particularly when they are putting 

241 
 
on some of the provided dress-up clothes, but when she turns to leave the room, she 
is momentarily blinded by the spotlight thanks to its position. Additionally, there is a 
single step up to get to the door that she subsequently trips over, proving that the 
spotlight is not only a hindrance but a real danger. Although Kasi freely admits to 
being clumsy from time to time and her dyspraxia leads to difficulty with coordination, 
it is not her clumsiness that leads her to looking into the spotlight but rather the 
positioning of the light (Appendix D 1.2).  
 
This spotlight is not the only light that is poorly positioned. Teagan (Abbey House; 
dyslexia, EDS) points out the lights in the Danger Zone temporary exhibition at 
Abbey House are situated in such a way that they create their own uneven shadows, 
shown below in Figure 28, (Appendix C 8.2). The harshness of the light also causes 
the sign itself to reflect some of the light, making it even more difficult to read. Much 
like with Alfie in the vignette above, the combination of lighting, materials, and 
placement make the sign so difficult for Kasi to read that she simply ignores it and 
moves on through the exhibition. It should also be noted that, although the Danger 
Zone exhibition is temporary, each temporary exhibition in this area utilizes the same 
basic format. In 2021, the temporary exhibition is “Sounds of Our City” and uses the 
same cases, same stands, and same style of interpretation panels, as shown in 
Figure 29 below. The consistency of the design means the lighting problem is 
present in both temporary exhibitions. Addressing this problem would then ensure 
the accessibility of future exhibitions as well, assuming they continue using the same 
layout.

8.3. Communal Reading. 
 
I’ve known Jessica for a few years now. We’ve worked on multiple projects 
together, spent an entire year in classes together, and yet during that time, I had 
no idea she had a hidden disability. More interestingly, neither did she. About a 
year before my research, Jessica was diagnosed with dyslexia and Irlen 
syndrome. For further information on dyslexia and Irlen syndrome, see Chapter 
6, but put simply, dyslexia is a neurodivergent learning disorder that generally 
makes it difficult to read while Irlen affects how the brain interprets light 
signals. These conditions, in turn, have an incredible impact on Jessica's 

244 
 
reading ability and therefore her engagement levels when she visits museums 
and heritage sites. 
 
Since her diagnosis, Jessica has started using several tools that help her brain 
better interpret the signals it receives. In particular, she has a colour overlay, 
shown in Figure 30, which tints the text and background of whatever she places 
the overlay on. It's small, like an elongated A5 sheet, but that means it's subtle 
enough for her to feel comfortable using it. Comfort, as it turned out, was a 
huge aspect of whether or not she used her overlay, and therefore how easily 
she could read interpretation boards. 
 
Figure 30. Jessica using her coloured overlay on a personal interpretation board at Treasurer’s House. 
Jessica and I visited Treasurer's House together, a site that has introduced what 
I have dubbed "personal interpretation boards." These boards are hand held, 

245 
 
movable, and have multiple copies so that several people can use them at the 
same time without crowding around one text panel. It is this personalisation 
that was crucial to Jessica's enjoyment. As we went around Treasurer's House, 
she picked up several of the personal interpretation boards and placed her 
overlay on them. As she describes it, “cI could put my overlay on it and not be 
embarrassed that people are trying to read it with me or anything like that. It 
was like my own little kind of panel for [the] five minutes I was having it. So 
that was quite nice actually. And it means that not everyone is kind of standing 
around one panel, people like to pick it up and then take it around the room 
with them.”8 
 
 
 
Like Jessica, many of my participants dislike forced “communal reading” displays. In 
many traditional museums, a single large text panel is present, encouraging people 
to gather around and read from one communal board – hence, communal reading. 
Indeed, both Barley Hall and Abbey House utilise this method to varying levels. Most 
displays in Abbey House are of this single, large text panel template. Other displays 
have smaller text panels, but again, they are singular, stationary, and meant to be 
shared by multiple people at the same time.  
 
Figure 31 shows one such panel from the temporary exhibition “Danger Zone” at 
Abbey House from 2019. These text panels have been created in line with the 
traditional wall panel – that is, each panel is anchored in one spot, immoveable, and 
thus forces multiple people to share the same panel – but it is much smaller than a 
traditional wall panel. The panel is about the size of an A3 sheet of paper, which 
makes it about twice the size of a regular piece of paper, but it is also mounted 
behind a pane of glass with walls on two sides, severely limiting the number of 
people who could view it at the same time. Kasi (Abbey House; ADHD, dyslexia, 
dyspraxia, EDS) also points out that, by putting it behind glass, she cannot touch the

board (Appendix C 8.2). The physicality of reading is particularly important to people 
with dyslexia, as their brains make text move around. Both Jessica (Treasurer's 
House; dyslexia, Irlen syndrome) and Alfie (Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision) 
mention that either touching the text or having some kind of line guide, such as 
Jessica’s overlay, is critical to keeping their place as they read through a paragraph 
(Appendix C 7.1; 2.1). In placing the text panel behind glass, Abbey House prevents 
Kasi from touching the board, causing her to struggle as she tries to read the board 
and not skip lines. In the end, she gives up and spends little time in the exhibition as 
a whole.

on it. 
 

247 
 
Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety) also mentions how she dislikes these communal 
reading panels. She comments that museums should have “more handout sheets to 
just pick up and read. If it's just on the wall or something, I tend to just scan it. 
Whereas with just a bit more time, I can hold it in my hand where I'm not sharing it 
with someone else. I would spend a little bit longer, not feel pushed to keep going” 
(Appendix C 9.3). This sentiment is echoed by Amy (Treasurer's House; anxiety, 
hypermobility, OCD): “I like that I can pick it up and take it around with me, so I don't 
feel like I'd have to stand in front of it or take it away from everybody else” (Appendix 
C 4.3). Their comments highlight an interesting aspect of a museum visit – the social 
pressure involved in the simple act of reading. If someone spends too long reading a 
stationary text panel, they prevent others from taking their place and thereby reading 
that same text panel. Dwell time in exhibitions has been widely studied (e.g., Chen et 
al. 2019; Na Ayudhya and Vavoula 2017; Schito and Testi 2017), but these studies 
focus more on how to increase dwell time or what causes people to shorten their 
dwell time. There is an inherent ableist assumption in all these studies, that if people 
linger at a particular piece of text, it is because they are interested in what the text is 
telling them. There is no mention of different reading speeds or the impact of 
learning difficulties or neurodiversity on dwell time. This only makes Amy and Lisa’s 
point even more salient – by holding a personalised interpretation board, not only 
would their dwell time increase, but their overall enjoyment would increase as well, 
as well as lowering their anxiety that people are judging them for taking so long at a 
particular text panel.  
 
At Barley Hall, the interpretation panels are more varied, with both large wall-
mounted text panels alongside smaller, handheld panels that could be picked up by 
visitors. In the temporary exhibition Magic and Mystery, both sizes are designed into 
the exhibition. The wall-mounted panels discuss the larger narratives of magic, 
science, and how the two overlap in the Medieval mind, as well as highlighting 
specific themes and people such as medieval prophets or Albertus Magnus, like 
those shown in Figure 32. The smaller text panels are linked to specific items that 
they are placed near, such as a replica astrolabe or a bowl full of St John’s Wort. 
These panels are either loose and can be handled by anyone, or are attached to 
stands that can still be picked up. Figure 33 shows a handheld panel about a witch 
bottle, an artefact that is on display in a case, with a copy of this panel in a holder on 

248 
 
the side of the case stand. As shown in the images, the design and theming for both 
the large panel and the small panel is consistent, tying them all together so that the 
size differences are not a distraction from the exhibit as a whole.

This mix of panel sizes is noted by several participants who visited Barley Hall. While 
the larger text panels are appreciated, it is the smaller panels that are particularly 
helpful. Alfie (Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision) has difficulty reading the larger 
wall mounted text panels due to a variety of reasons (Appendix D 2.2). Between the 
low lighting, the quantity of text, and the stylistic choices of the board (font, spacing, 
and placing text over images), every single wall panel is difficult for him to read. But 
the smaller panels are a different story. By being able to pick up these smaller 
personal interpretation boards, Alfie is able to bring it closer to his face or take it to a 
brighter place in the room to read it more easily. The smaller panels still present 
some difficulty in reading them, but simply being able to move to better lighting 

250 
 
eliminates one of the barriers for Alfie and allowed him to read the signs with less 
difficulty.  
 
Amanda (Barley Hall; heart failure, psoriatic arthritis) would have preferred different 
themes on the smaller panels, but appreciates them nonetheless. Her suggestion to 
Barley Hall is thus (Appendix C 3.3): 
“[Have those] information things as you’re entering [a room]. There were one or two 
of those tablet type things, so if you hadn't purchased the book, it would be quite 
helpful. Somebody could pick [a panel] up as they went in the room.  
Her arthritis makes it difficult for her to carry around a guide book, and information on 
the building itself is only available through that guide book. This in turn means that 
people like Amanda, who do not purchase the guidebook, miss out on information 
that they want, something that Amanda herself mentions a few times. But, as she 
also mentions, having small, hand held panels with information on the room and 
building itself would have greatly increased her enjoyment of Barley Hall.  
 
At Treasurer's House, they have consciously made the decision to use only smaller 
boards – and multiple copies of each board as well. In each room, a stand holds 
three different sets of boards, each following a specific theme: Grand Designs, Frank 
Green, and Treasurer’s Treasures. Figure 34 and Figure 35 show a sample stand 
and boards from one of the rooms. These themes are consistent throughout the 
house, so that visitors can follow as many of these themes as they like. As Jessica’s 
vignette above shows, this decision to have multiple copies of smaller interpretation 
boards leads to a more meaningful, enjoyable experience. It is not only Jessica 
whose visit is enhanced: most participants in this research comment on how much 
they like or want these kinds of personal interpretation boards (Appendix C 2.3; 3.3; 
4.3; 5.3; 6.3; 7.3; 9.3). 
 

251

thematic board, as well as a laminated packet of information regarding the objects in the room. 

252 
 
 
Figure 35. Three personal interpretation boards, each highlighting the three different themes that are followed 
through Treasurer’s House. 
Although it is unlikely these personal interpretation boards were originally created 
with accessibility in mind, they have proven to be a valuable accessibility asset. For 
Lisa and Amy, having this personal board to hold means that their anxiety does not 
make them feel pressured to move on before they had read everything. For Alfie, he 
can move the board to a different place in the room in order to read it, a crucial point 
given that he has quite severe visual difficulties. Amanda, although her disability is 
more physical, also makes an important point: given her arthritis, she may not be 
able to carry a guidebook around through the whole museum. But being able to pick 
up a smaller, lighter board that is relevant to only one room, then leave it behind 
when she is done with it, would give her the opportunity to learn the information she 
may have otherwise had to bypass in favour of physical comfort.  
 
On the topic of physical comfort, Ellie (Treasurer's House; anxiety, chronic vestibular 
migraines, depression, fibromyalgia) does mention that the panels at Treasurer's 
House were slightly unwieldy: “I think just size wise they were just that slightly 
awkward size that were slightly bigger than a A4 which I think it's just because you 

253 
 
know, you’re used to holding something that's A4, it just felt a little bit awkward” 
(Appendix C 5.3). This complaint is echoed by other participants to Treasurer's 
House: Jessica (Treasurer's House; dyslexia, Irlen syndrome) mentions that “it was 
quite hard to kind of navigate my overlay and the heavy panels at the same time” 
(Appendix C 7.3) and James (Treasurer's House; fibromyalgia) also comments that 
the boards were a bit on the heavy side (Appendix C 6.2). There is clearly room for 
improvement, but as Ellie says, “in terms of the design and the intent behind [the 
personal interpretation boards], I really like them” (Appendix C 5.3). 
 
During the COVID-19, these personal interpretation boards and their cousins have 
been some of the first things taken away from my case study sites. Treasurer's 
House, once they finally re-opened, has removed them entirely. Partly this is due to 
them being a touch point, something that museums are working to minimise, but it is 
also partly due to the new tour-led experience at the House. There is no free-flow 
aspect to a visit now, and all the content is dictated by the tour guide who led the 
group around the building. Similarly, Abbey House has removed their smaller, hand-
held interpretation texts due to the pandemic.  
 
Barley Hall is a slight anomaly compared to the other sites: it did not remove any of 
the smaller, hand-held panels. Instead, they have added signs asking people to not 
touch objects (but not the panels), placed hand sanitiser stations in every room, and 
also introduced a cleaning crew that moves from site to site and cleans touch points 
on a regular basis throughout the day. The cleaning crew are specifically instructed 
to clean the hand-held panels as well, implying that they expected people to still hold 
them.  
8.4. Discussion. 
Throughout this chapter, I have highlighted the barriers that my participants faced at 
each case study site, as well as the passive accessibility measures that my 
participants suggested. As a reminder, passive accessibility measures are 
embedded into the design of an exhibition and require no gatekeeping, allowing all 
visitors to freely use them. As a framework to highlight the efficacy of these passive 
accessibility measures, I have adapted (McKercher and Darcy’s (2018) hierarchy of 

254 
 
barriers, changing it into tiers of accessibility. I discussed their research in Chapter 3, 
and Figure 36 is their visualisation of these barriers: 
 
 
Figure 36. Hierarchy of Barriers figure, taken from McKercher and Darcy (2018, 60). 
 
In turn, I have created the following table to understand accessibility measures, 
shown in Figure 37. 
 
 

255 
 
 
Figure 37. Hierarchy of accessibility measures. 
Whereas McKercher and Darcy illustrate barriers to travel as experienced by 
disabled people, I illustrate how passive, embedded accessibility measures can 
benefit larger groups of people. Each tier represents how “universal” each 
accessibility measure can be, with the largest pool of potential users in Tier 1 and 
becoming progressively more specialised as the tiers rise. For example, all people 
can use automatic doors and find them particularly helpful, not only wheelchair users 
or people with arthritis, placing it in Tier 1. Likewise, people with many different 
disabilities and impairments benefit from using large print guides, meaning they are 
Tier 2. Measures such as Braille signage or BSL tours can only be utilised by people 
with specific disabilities, hence Tier 3. Tier 4 are tools specific to each person, such 
as Jessica’s coloured overlay or Ellie’s walking stick. Passive accessibility measures 
are embedded into the design process so as to be used by a wide range of people, 
placing them in Tier 2, if not Tier 1. Passive accessibility benefits far more people, 
tearing down disabling barriers and creating a more inclusive experience for all 
visitors.  
 

256 
 
In discussing each of the barriers I have presented in this chapter, participants did 
not merely point out how challenging these barriers are, but also often offer solutions 
or suggestions. Interestingly, many, if not all, of the suggestions put forward were 
passive accessibility measures, further emphasising the importance of passive 
accessibility. Participants do not want accessibility as an “add-on” measure, they 
want it embedded into the design of the experience. Perhaps their experience of 
having a hidden disability means they value these passive approaches all the more.  
 
After the initial phase of data collection, I met with management staff at both Abbey 
House and Barley Hall to discuss my research findings and pass on participant 
suggestions. As mentioned in Chapter 6, I have been unable to reach anyone at 
Treasurer's House after the pandemic, and so was unable to present these findings 
to them. Below I discuss the proposed solutions to these challenging areas, as well 
as feedback from the sites’ management where possible. 
 
At first glance, it may seem that the layout of a building, especially a listed building, 
is something that cannot be altered. Whilst this is true, it would be a mistake to 
dismiss this problem as unsolvable. The very first thing Teagan (Abbey House; 
dyslexia, EDS) did when planning her visit was to see if they had a map of the site 
available (Appendix D 8.1). Other participants as well express a desire for some kind 
of map or guidance system at the sites. The physical layout of these sites cannot be 
changed, but providing maps to show the layout of the building is perceived as not 
only a suitable alternative, but is in fact a commonly desired item. Whether to help 
navigate a building, to ensure a visitor explores the entire site, or to target specific 
exhibits within the museum, participants want a map at the sites they visit. Indeed, 
there is already a recommendation from Kids in Museums (2018, 2) to provide maps 
to visitors.  
 
In 2019, when I brought the confusing layout issue up to Ellen (Treasurer's House), 
she nodded understandingly. In order to alleviate this common complaint, 
Treasurer's House planned to release a new leaflet in spring of 2020, one that 
included a map of the site (Appendix G 3.4). However, as previously mentioned, the 
pandemic has changed a great number of plans, and no such leaflet has been 
produced. Further, post-pandemic, I was unable to ask anyone at Treasurer's House 

257 
 
about how their plans have changed and if these leaflets have been completely 
cancelled or merely postponed. Given that access to Treasurer's House is now 
through guided tours, it may seem there is less of a need for these maps. However, 
as my participants have explained, maps are a critical planning tool for people with 
hidden disabilities. Even if the free-flow experience never returns, I wonder if maps 
will be somehow incorporated into the experience.  
 
Interestingly, due to the pandemic, Barley Hall seems to have fixed their layout 
challenge. As discussed in Chapter 7, they adapted their site to a one-way route, 
moving from a combined entrance/exit area to a separate entrance and exit. Visitors 
were also given hand-held maps to show them the way through the site, seen in 
Figure 38. In speaking with Maggie (Barley Hall), there was initial discussion of 
changing back to the single entrance/exit once pandemic restrictions were lifted. 
However, after listening to feedback from visitors, staff members, and my own 
research, they decided to keep the pandemic-induced layout, although they would be 
less stringent on the one-way system. Likewise, they would keep the hand-held 
maps, also due to this feedback (Appendix G 2.3).  
 
Figure 38. Handheld maps that are given to visitors at Barley Hall. 

258 
 
 
At Abbey House, a one-way system was introduced in the Victorian Street due to 
COVID-19. The signage in the street was extremely helpful in orienting visitors 
through the street, allowing them to examine each of the small alleyways. In our 
meeting together, I spoke to Mary (Abbey House) about the usefulness of the “one 
way” signs in the street and she said that they had been working on developing a 
map for the site for some time now (Appendix G 1.3). After discussing this research, 
she suggests she has made the map a higher priority to be completed and 
introduced as soon as possible. 
 
The lighting is a more difficult challenge to address, and thus far, no site has a 
solution that balances aesthetics, conservation, and readability. Although it is 
tempting to simply say “make the lighting brighter,” the full picture is much more 
nuanced. As seen in section 8.2 above, not everyone likes having bright lights or 
indeed could even tolerate them. Some people also really enjoy the ambiance of a 
building that is closer to the historical lighting levels of the period it represents. 
Indeed, Barley Hall in particular is truly beautiful in the low light, and very much 
becomes a phenomenological experience in those moments, with the sights, sounds, 
and smells of a Medieval townhouse coming alive with the absence of obvious 
modern conveniences. Likewise, the staged moment in the Christmas decorations at 
Treasurer's House is hugely popular and, again, brings the experience alive in ways 
few other means of interpretation can. Treasurer's House feels lived in again, rather 
than a house frozen in time. Rather than visitors, people feel like they are invited 
guests trailing after a party. Abbey House too previously utilised a lighting cycle on 
their Victorian Street, simulating a day and night cycle. They had removed this 
particular aspect because visitors had complained that it was too difficult to read 
when the lights were low (Appendix G 1.1), but that in and of itself is precisely the 
reason for these nuanced approaches.  
 
In areas where reading is an integral part of the experience, the lighting must be on 
the brighter side. According to Health and Safety Executive guidelines, the minimum 
level for reading is 100 lux (Health and Safety Executive 1997, 28). In a perfect 
world, text panels would be in well-lit areas, where visitors did not strain their eyes to 
read. Other areas could still have lower lights, creating a more atmospheric scene, 

259 
 
but those areas would not have text-based interpretation. Indeed, the presumption 
that interpretation must be text-based is a false one. Audio-visual presentations, 
videos, sound recordings, live interpreters, and even objects to manipulate are 
equally valid means of providing interpretation. Jessica (Treasurer's House; dyslexia, 
Irlen syndrome) even suggests that sites have a downloadable document on their 
website that visitors can load on their phone, allowing people to use their own 
devices (and personal accessibility tools, like a screen reader) even in darker rooms 
(Appendix C 7.3), while Alfie (Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision) suggests an 
app with audio content (Appendix C 2.3). Both unintentionally support Moscardo’s 
(2015, 296) assertion that “mobile apps offer tourists the ability to have greater 
control over their experience.” While Moscardo likely did not write that with 
accessibility in mind, nevertheless these suggestions highlight the potential 
flexibility that digital tools offer.  
 
Another way to counteract challenging light levels is through the personal 
interpretation boards described in section 8.3 above. These moveable boards mean 
that visitors who need more light can take them to another area that is brighter, 
potentially by a window or a lamp, without needing the whole room to be brighter. 
The aesthetic appeal of a room can be maintained whilst also allowing for reading 
lights. 
 
Whilst only two sites have larger communal reading panels, each site has some 
version of a personal interpretation board. Invariably, the smaller, personal boards 
are popular amongst my participants for a variety of reasons. Some participants like 
how it allows them to spend more time with a particular piece of writing. Some 
participants like that they can move around with the boards. Some even like that it 
feels more personal and personalised, making their visit more memorable and 
meaningful. Whatever the reason, they are a passive accessibility measure that 
participants feel other sites should utilise more.  
 
When I presented my research findings to Maggie (Barley Hall), she was very 
enthusiastic about trying to incorporate the personal interpretation boards into the 
exhibition. She told me that Barley Hall used to have similar panels in previous 

260 
 
exhibitions, but they had been removed during an exhibition change (Appendix G 
2.3). At the time of this writing, she has already contacted the Head of Exhibitions 
and they are working on making personal interpretation boards for not just Barley 
Hall, but potentially also their other sites and the travelling exhibitions that The 
JORVIK Group lends out. 
 
During my follow-up interview with Mary (Abbey House), she also expressed 
enthusiasm for the personal interpretation boards. She noted that they were planning 
on bringing back their smaller interpretation sheets once it was safe to do so and will 
be encouraging the curatorial staff to utilise these smaller style text panels in the 
future (Appendix G 1.3). 
 
Unfortunately, I was unable to contact the management staff at Treasurer's House 
after the pandemic, but I wonder what their plans are going forward. There was great 
excitement in Winter of 2019 about the introduction of iPads to each room, 
mentioned in Chapter 6, so that room guides could show an archive of photos, 
articles, and other items that were not on display. However, with the new format, it 
seems like those iPads have been pulled, if they ever existed at all, along with the 
personal interpretation boards. Given the positive feedback on these boards, it is a 
disappointing omission and it will be interesting to see the impact of tour-only 
experiences going forward. 
8.5. Summary. 
My three case study sites have a mix of active and passive accessibility measures, a 
mix that has changed over the course of this research. Through site visits and 
interviews with my participants, as well as observations at these sites, it became 
clear that passive accessibility tools were the preferred method of my participants 
when it came to adapting a non-accessible area of their visit. The layout of a building 
could not be changed, but a map provided to all visitors was helpful not only as a 
navigation aid, but also as a planning tool. There may be no such thing as the 
“perfect” lighting level, but acknowledging the main use of a room, whether 
atmospheric or for reading, and lighting it accordingly was crucial for participants to 
actually engage with a room. Communal reading was disliked by a wide range of 

261 
 
participants for an equally wide range of reasons, and the introduction of personal 
interpretation boards offered them a much better alternative to larger, singular 
interpretation panels. These passive accessibility measures, built-in to the design of 
the site, were far more effective and used by far more people than active 
accessibility measures (e.g., touch tours kept behind the desk), proving once again 
that embedding accessibility into the design process is the most inclusive way of 
designing a heritage experience.  
 
 

262 
 
Chapter 9 – Lack of 
Communication. 
 
Some days, Barley Hall can feel empty. Only two front of house members and 
a duty manager are needed to run the site, and they rarely have any volunteers, 
aside from specific days when the “Barley Hall servants” are in residence. 
 
On one of the days I’m there observing, it seems to be an unusually full day 
staff-wise. I’m standing at the admissions desk with Gwen, talking to her about 
the changes that have happened since the pandemic. As we’re talking, the site 
manager Dean comes down from the office upstairs, pausing to chat with us at 
the desk. As a beekeeper in his spare time, he’s working on a new 
interpretation panel to go with the “Buzz about York” initiative, a campaign to 
create bee-friendly areas and raise awareness about bees in the city. He needed 
to stretch his legs and step away from his computer, so he came downstairs to 
see how Gwen was doing and if I was getting enough data. The conversation 
only lasts a minute or two, and it never delves very deep, but there is a warmth 
to it that indicates a level of comfort between them. 
 
A little while later, another manager comes down. This time it’s Kieran, who is 
the duty manager for the day. He’s doing the hourly walk-around, where the 
duty manager checks on staff members, walks through the site to make sure 
visitors are fine and nothing is out of order in the exhibits, and also checks the 
toilets to make sure they’re clean and stocked. Today, Kieran is also carrying a 
bucket of sanitizing wipes to clean high traffic areas and touch points as well, 
such as handrails and signs. Again, he stops and chats with us for a few 
minutes, just small talk about how the day is going, if there are any visitors in 
at the moment, and how the rest of the day is looking. He might have stayed 

263 
 
and talked a little longer, but then a visitor enters the admissions area, so he 
leaves to let Gwen greet and admit them.  
 
“Good afternoon,” she smiles as the visitors step up to the admissions desk. 
“Do you have a booking with us?” 
 
As she checks in the visitors, who have indeed pre-booked their tickets, she 
casually chats with them about how lovely the weather is, if a bit too hot when 
you’re in the sun. She explains the changes that have taken place at Barley Hall 
because of COVID-19, and gestures to a basket of maps on the desk, saying 
they are free to take one if they’d like. The visitors do take one, asking how 
long they have to visit the museum. “Take as long as you like!” Gwen replies. 
“Most people spend about an hour, but we don’t close for another few hours.” 
 
About half an hour later, I’m wrapping up my observations for the day. Barley 
Hall is closing soon, and while there’s still a few visitors making their way 
through, the final time slot has already been admitted. The person who walks 
through the door, however, is not a visitor: it’s one of the cleaning crew, Jared, 
making his rounds. The cleaning crew is tasked with visiting each of the sites 
and spot cleaning the high traffic touch points, filling up the hand sanitizer 
stations, and generally making sure that everything COVID-19-related is up to 
standards. As well as being part of the cleaning crew, Jared also works at the 
JORVIK Viking Centre as one of the costumed interpreters – he dresses up as a 
Viking and talks to visitors.  
 
He also talks to his co-workers. Though he’s only here to do some cleaning, he 
stops in and talks with both myself and Gwen. He hasn’t been to Barley Hall 
very often, as he’s only recently joined the cleaning crew, so this is actually the 
first time he’s met Gwen. But the way they speak to each other, it’s like they’re 
old friends. There’s a comradery that flows naturally, just as it did between Jess 
and the managers. In fact, every time I visit Barley Hall, both with participants 

264 
 
and to observe, there’s an easy, familial feeling between the staff there, adding 
to the overall welcoming atmosphere of the place9. 
 
 
 
The vignette above represents a small snapshot of Gwen’s day, yet it encapsulates 
so much of the experience of a heritage site. Many types of interpersonal 
communication take place, often one flowing into another, and it is these interactions 
that I examine in this chapter. Specifically, I examine the meaningful communication 
inherent in these interactions and how communication is critical to creating inclusive, 
accessible experiences for both visitors and staff alike. 
 
Of relevance here are the concepts of “dialogue” and “dialogic moments” - instances 
within interpersonal communication where dialogue is achieved. According to Black 
(2008, 98), “dialogic moments are fleeting, typically unplanned, instances where 
partners experience being both present and open to the other’s experience.” Kim 
and Kim (2008, 53) likewise position dialogue as the means through which people 
“freely interact with one another to understand mutually the self and others, resulting 
in the production and reproduction of rules, shared values, and public reasons for 
deliberation.” Dialogue, then, is how people come to understand each other, and in 
the context of my research, how I come to understand the embodied knowledge of 
my participants.  
 
Within this chapter, I examine not only the dialogic moments that I observed, but also 
where lack of dialogue, and lack of communication in general, hinders any potential 
for dialogue, particularly regarding accessibility. In the vignette above, Gwen 
interacts with multiple people. The moments may not be significant, such as her 
interaction with Jared, but they still allow for understanding between parties. 
Likewise, her interaction with Kieran represents another, more significant moment of 
communication. In each instance, the parties are “both present and open” (as per 
Black 2008, 98) in the conversation, creating dialogic moments that lay a foundation 
                                            
9 As mentioned in Chapter 6, I sent each vignette to the appropriate participant in order to ensure I 
captured their thought process and feelings accurately. Each has been included in this thesis with 
their approval. 

265 
 
for open communication. Although none of these instances were specifically in 
regards to accessibility, a foundation for open communication is critical in order to 
allow for such conversations to take place.  
 
Below I examine communication in three distinct categories: visitor/staff interactions, 
team interactions, and hierarchical staff interactions. Visitor/staff interactions are the 
focus of much research (e.g., Pop and Borza 2015; Kim et al. 2012), and rightly so. 
This is where the visitor experience takes place, and the interaction between visitors 
and staff has a profound impact upon the visitor’s enduring memory of a visit (Su and 
Teng 2018; Navarro et al. 2014; Mey and Mohamed 2010). Visitors can also provide 
critical feedback on accessibility (Lynch and Proverbs 2020; Gilmore and Rentschler 
2002). However, front of house staff rarely are in positions of power to act upon the 
feedback they receive, instead relying on managers to further any suggestions front 
of house staff may give. Therefore, I also examine staff interactions to understand 
hindrances to implementing accessibility suggestions, dividing them between team 
and hierarchical staff interactions. 
 
Team interactions refer to different staff groups cooperating with one another. In the 
vignette above, several staff teams communicate with one another. Gwen belongs to 
the Barley Hall front of house staff team, yet she interacts with the management 
team (Dean and Kieran) and the cleaning team (Jared). At Abbey House, there are 
similar teams: during my observations, I saw front of house, management, cleaning, 
and technical teams (Appendix G 1.1). At Treasurer's House, I observed admissions, 
café, volunteer, and management teams (Appendix G 3.1), although I understood 
the site also had conservation, cleaning, and gardening teams.  
 
Likewise, I consider hierarchical staff interactions: in the vignette above, I classify the 
interaction between Gwen and Kieran as hierarchical. There is a power dynamic 
present in the conversation, as Kieran is undertaking one of his duties, performing 
his hourly check of the site. He is also attempting to elicit information from Gwen 
regarding the site – namely, if there are any visitors in at the moment or any 
problems she is aware of. The two are not interacting as members of different teams, 
but rather as a manager with their subordinate. 
 

266 
 
In examining the three types of interaction (visitor/staff, team, and hierarchical staff), 
I argue that communication, especially dialogue, is essential in creating an inclusive 
environment and dismantling barriers to accessibility. However, sometimes the 
barrier itself is a lack of communication. As in Chapter 8, I explore these interactions 
first using vignettes, exemplifying either communication or a lack thereof. 
Additionally, I use quotes from my participants as well as observations made during 
ethnographic study of my sites and interviews with staff to further understand how 
these types of interpersonal communications can impact the accessibility of a site. 
Due to my limited ethnographic observations (affected by COVID-19, see Chapter 6), 
I supplement my data with relevant academic research examining similar types of 
interactions. Finally, I discuss the implications of these interactions, arguing that 
dialogue between people is crucial in all three relationships (visitor/staff, team, 
hierarchical) in order to fully understand and accommodate the needs of visitors with 
hidden disabilities.  
9.1. Visitor/Staff Interaction. 
 
It’s the end of November, and I’m walking through Treasurer’s House with 
Ellie (anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, depression, fibromyalgia). It’s cold 
and damp outside, making it rather chilly inside this old Edwardian mansion. 
We’re bundled up in coats and scarves, and knowing that these conditions can 
cause a flare-up of her fibromyalgia, Ellie has brought her walking cane. It’s a 
collapsible cane, so she can carry it with her at all times, but she decided before 
we went into the House to unfold it and use it, just in case. There is a lot of 
walking and standing inside Treasurer’s House. 
 
But no one notices her cane (shown in Figure 39). True, it’s a dark colour and 
blends in with her coat, but her coat doesn’t reach the floor, while her cane 
does. She doesn’t lean on it heavily as she stands, nor does she walk with a 
noticeable limp. Yet still, the cane is there. As we go around, I notice that my 
own legs are getting achy, mostly thanks to the weather, and every now and 
then, Ellie shifts on her feet a bit as she’s standing. However, no one offers her 

267 
 
a chair or tells her where she can sit in each of the rooms. Seating can be a 
confusing matter in a National Trust property, as there’s often several chairs 
that are “out of bounds” because they’re part of the collection. In past years, 
they may have had a sign on them that said “do not touch” but National Trust is 
trying to move away from both signage and negative instructions. Still, that 
leaves us with rooms and rooms of chairs and nowhere to sit, nor anyone who 
offers us a seat.

Until we reach the basement, at least. It’s a modern room, with patterned 
wooden floors and a screen with two sets of headphones attached. In the middle 
stands a large table with a 3D tactile model of the Roman fort that stood on the 
very spot now occupied by York Minster – and Treasurer’s House. There are 
no room guides in here, but there is something far more important: chairs. The 
furniture is bare but abundant, with not only wooden chairs but also benches 

268 
 
and stools for people to sit on. Ellie immediately sinks down into a stool 
(shown in Figure 40), and lets out a small sigh of relief before she turns her 
attention to a video about the Romans in York. At last, she can rest her aching 
joints and give her full attention to Treasurer’s House10.

captured their thought process and feelings accurately. Each has been included in this thesis with 
their approval.

In the vignette above, Ellie experiences a decided lack of communication from staff 
members regarding her disability and therefore her access needs. Indeed, only once 
we enter an unstaffed room, devoid of any opportunity to speak to staff members, is 
she able to finally address her accessibility needs herself. As I discuss in Chapter 7, 
the lack of chairs – or at least, the confusion over which chairs can be sat in and 
which are off-limits – at Treasurer’s House is a source of great frustration to my 
participants. However, I would argue that the true barrier is not the lack of chairs, but 
rather the lack of communication between visitors and staff members regarding 
them. This lack of communication between visitors with hidden disabilities and staff 
members regarding accessibility is a common theme across all my case study sites. 
 
To be clear, interactions between visitors and front of house staff members, as I 
observed both with my participants and in my ethnographic study, are 
overwhelmingly positive. No participants have any complaints about the staff 
members they interact with, and in fact, many comment on how accommodating and 
helpful staff were (Appendix C 1.3; 2.3; 3.3; 4.3; 5.3; 6.3; 7.3; 8.3; 9.3). On the 
surface, there is great satisfaction from my participants when it comes to visitor/staff 
interaction. However, the truth is more nuanced than this, especially when 
considering communication through the lens of dialogue.  
 
As part of the post-visit interview, I ask participants if they thought they would have 
been treated differently if their disability was visible. Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety) 
immediately agrees (Appendix C 9.3):  
I think if you come in, if you have a physical disability, I think people are much more 
comfortable with offering you help, or asking if you need any help. They would, you 
know, ‘just let me get that door for you.’ … I think they would be much more open to 
asking you if you need help – which can be bad as well because it can presume that 
just because you’re in a wheelchair, you need help and you’re not independent. So I 
suppose it goes both ways. But they wouldn’t look at me, especially because they 
know me, they wouldn’t look at me and say ‘do you need any help today?’ And if they 
did, I’d probably say no, even if I was really anxious. 
Lisa’s observations are interesting because there is a tension between her wanting 
to have someone ask if she needs help, and yet not necessarily wanting to accept 
that help. This tension is a common theme for people with anxiety, such as Lisa 

270 
 
(Damer et al. 2010). Recall in Chapter 8, Amy (Treasurer's House; anxiety, 
hypermobility, OCD) says “I hate asking for things. I don’t want to bother anyone” 
(Appendix C 4.2).  Likewise, Lisa does not want to bother anyone, but there is a 
sense that the simple gesture of offering help would have been appreciated. 
 
Lisa’s comment is echoed in something else Amy shared in a later interview. When 
asked if she felt she had been treated differently from other visitors, Amy says 
(Appendix C 4.3):  
No, I don’t think so. I’m just going to add that I almost would have liked to. Again, 
mainly referring to the fact that I went to sit down and that guy [the room guide] 
stayed on the other side of the room. Like I almost wish that they would have gone 
‘oh, do you want to sit?’ But of course, they wouldn’t have known to do that.  
As a young, healthy-looking woman, there is no outward sign that Amy wants or 
needs any additional help. Yet, as she points out, when she does move to sit whilst 
talking to a room guide, it takes him several moments to follow her to keep the 
conversation going, and he also never confirms she could sit on the bench where 
she rests. At a site where it is difficult to know what can be touched and what cannot, 
a small comment of “yes, you can sit there” can make a significant difference.  
 
James (Treasurer's House; fibromyalgia) feels the same. When asked if he felt he 
would have been treated differently had his disability been visible, he says (Appendix 
C 6.4): 
Probably, yes… You would feel, or you’d hope at least, that they’d be like, if you 
need to sit, take one, that type of thing… Because of the hidden disability, they think 
obviously, immediately there’s nothing wrong with you until you say ‘there’s 
something wrong with me, and do you mind if I take this seat?’ But I feel that if we did 
have a physical thing, walking around with a stick, they would say ‘well do feel free to 
take a seat.’  
Again, there is a sense that although they are treated comparably to nondisabled 
visitors, they want that extra measure of consideration that visibly disabled visitors 
might receive.  
 
Aaron (Treasurer's House; autism, bipolar disorder, OCD) disagrees with this 
opinion, saying that if the room guides were aware of his disabilities, he expects 

271 
 
them to “[have a] look in their eyes, hair standing up on their arms, people kinda 
taking steps back” (Appendix C 1.3). Whether this expectation comes from personal 
experience was unclear, but it is yet another example of why people may not wish to 
disclose their disability (Menendez 2018; Cox 2013). Aaron’s worry that people will 
treat him negatively based on his disability reflects the need for more open 
communication regarding accessibility – should he choose to disclose his 
accessibility needs, he should feel confident that people will discuss those needs 
with him and accommodate them as best as they can, not that they will immediately 
shut down the interaction and make him feel unwelcome. 
 
The overwhelmingly positive opinion of my participants regarding the staff members 
indicates to me that any hesitation to ask for help came from an aspect of their 
disability rather than any staff member being unwelcoming. Indeed, when I ask 
Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS) and Kasi (Abbey House; ADHD, dyslexia, 
dyspraxia, EDS) about this contradiction between finding the staff friendly and 
approachable but not actually wanting to approach them, Teagan says (Appendix C 
8.3): 
I think that's more Kasi's personality. She will literally start asking questions of 
whoever's standing there, just whoever is literally right next to her and her curiosity. 
[Her curiosity is] not as strong enough to actually go up and ask someone once she's 
left the particular area.  
In this case, Kasi’s ADHD means that she will turn to the nearest person to answer a 
question rather than spend additional time and attention in seeking out a staff 
member. It also echoes Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety) and Amy’s (Treasurer's House; 
anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) comments about not wanting to bother anyone, a 
comment they make likely due to their anxiety. 
 
However, as Amy, James (Treasurer's House; fibromyalgia), and Lisa have all 
pointed out, there is no outward sign for staff members to see that they needed help 
and therefore to initiate a conversation. Likewise, Amanda (Barley Hall; heart failure, 
psoriatic arthritis) notes that staff treated her the same as other visitors “probably 
because they didn’t necessarily know I had a disability. I don’t have a cane or 
anything” (Appendix C 3.3). On one hand, it is a good thing that they are treated the 
same as nondisabled visitors, especially given Aaron’s comment. But as many have 

272 
 
mentioned, they would have liked to have been treated differently. There is still a 
sense from my participants that staff could have done more.  
 
There is an interesting tension within all these comments – the desire to have their 
disability accommodated for, but without disclosing their disability. I discuss this 
quandary further below in section 9.4, but this is another example of the importance 
of Passive Accessibility, which I examine in Chapter 8. If, for example, all staff 
members mention where visitors can sit, then that particular accessibility need is 
accommodated for and no disabled visitors need to single themselves out. In fact, 
this is what happens at Barley Hall (Appendix D 2.2; G 2.1): the admissions person 
tells visitors that they are free to use the furniture as intended. In other words, they 
can sit anywhere they like. In this way, proper communication regarding accessibility 
is a passive accessibility measure, as it is built into the design of the exhibition 
through staff training. 
 
Returning to my participants’ belief that staff members could do more regarding the 
accessibility of their sites, the staff members and volunteers I interviewed agree. 
During my observations, I specifically ask them about the accessibility of the site. 
Almost everyone comments that there was only so much they could physically do 
with the site, as I discuss in Chapter 4, so they do what they can to compensate. At 
Barley Hall, Gwen speaks proudly about how, if a wheelchair user comes to Barley 
Hall, they offer free admission because a wheelchair user could only access the 
lower level, and even then, requires a portable ramp to be placed throughout the 
space to accommodate them (Appendix G 2.1). At Abbey House, Ella tells me about 
a time they had a visitor in an ECV11. The visitor could use the stairs, so using the lift 
was the only option to travel to the upper level. Unfortunately, the ECV turned out to 
be mere centimetres too large for the lift doors to close, even once they had 
removed the handles from inside the lift. As Ella recounts the incident to me, the 
disappointment in her voice is clear, despite doing everything possible to 
accommodate that visitor (Appendix G 1.1). Similar stories about helping (visibly) 
disabled visitors are shared over and over during my observations at all three sites, 
highlighting their commitment to accessibility and the experience of disabled visitors.

273 
 
 
However, when I mention that I am particularly interested in visitors with hidden 
disabilities, many staff members express their own frustration over not knowing how 
to help. Carly, a volunteer at Treasurer’s House, explains to me that although they 
are planning on introducing the sunflower lanyard scheme (discussed further below 
in section 4), staff at the property simply have no idea what else they could do 
(Appendix G 3.5). There is no doubt that for the staff members I interviewed, they str 
passionate about making their site as accessible as possible (Appendix G 1.2; 2.2; 
3.2), but the lack of available research regarding accessibility for people with hidden 
disabilities proved a significant hindrance. 
 
Both participants and staff alike express a desire to engage in open communication 
regarding accessibility, particularly for people with hidden disabilities. Participants 
like Amy (Treasurer's House; anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) and Lisa (Abbey House; 
anxiety) would like to be asked if they need help, even if they would not necessarily 
accept that help (Appendix C 4.3; 9.3). Staff members like Ella and Gwen 
acknowledge the limitations of their site and therefore want alternative means of 
increasing the accessibility of the site (Appendix G 1.1; 2.1), but they simply do not 
know where to start. It is the lack of dialogue (and information in general) that proves 
to be the true barrier here, something I explore further below in section 9.4. 
9.2. Team Interactions. 
 
I’ve spent a few days now at Treasurer’s House, enough time that I recognize 
the admissions staff when I arrive and they recognize me. I’m still learning 
names, but they all know mine by now. They know that I’m here for my 
research, and they’re very eager to tell me about accessibility-related things 
that I missed. On my second day there, both admissions staff members were 
very excited to tell me about the seeing eye service dog that visited less than an 
hour after I had left.  
 
Soon enough, I settle into my usual position at the side of the desk, watching 
them interact with visitors and chat with each other. As time goes on, I notice 

274 
 
that I haven’t seen anyone from “upstairs” come down – the management staff 
who run various teams within the property. When I ask about this, Lee, one of 
the admissions staff, tells me, “Oh, they’re on call. If we have any problems, 
we can call whoever’s on duty on the radio and they’ll come and sort it out.” 
 
While I haven’t seen any of the management staff, I have seen a lot of 
volunteers coming in and out of the little break room next to the admissions 
area. Like most National Trust properties, they have a large number of 
volunteers that operate as room guides, explaining to visitors about the history 
of the house and the special items within each room. It was often these 
volunteer room guides that my participants commented upon, saying how 
welcoming and friendly they were. There’s an awful lot of them, up to 17 on 
any given day. 
 
I comment to Lee that it must take a lot of memory work to remember all the 
volunteers. “They usually volunteer on a certain day each week,” she explains. 
“So if they come in on a different day, I don’t recognize them.”12 
 
 
 
The concept of staff teams is not new, but I find the interaction – or rather, absence 
of interaction – between these teams fascinating during my ethnographic 
observations. In the vignette above, there is little to no interaction between the 
admissions team, the volunteer team, and the manager team. Even within teams at 
Treasurer's House, there is a further fracturing of groups: the volunteer team, easily 
the largest group within Treasurer's House, is divided from staff and further divided 
by which day a volunteer works at Treasurer's House, and is then even further 
divided into morning and afternoon shifts. Dr Heather Smith, Equity Officer for the 
National Trust and one of their officers on the national level (yet another team), 
                                            
12 As mentioned in Chapter 6, I sent each vignette to the appropriate participant in order to ensure I 
captured their thought process and feelings accurately. Each has been included in this thesis with 
their approval. 

275 
 
confirmed that this grouping of staff is usual practice for the Trust. The sheer number 
of teams within one property is almost overwhelming, and it is little wonder that Lee 
could not recognise each and every volunteer.  
 
In truth, I see little interaction between the teams at Treasurer's House. During all of 
my time observing at the House, I only observe the managers descend the stairs 
once – when one of the National Trust official photographers visits Treasurer's 
House to take some publicity photos (Appendix G 3.1). Granted, as Lee explains in 
the vignette above, duty managers are only summoned downstairs when there is an 
emergency, so not seeing duty managers could simply mean that they are not 
needed on the days I visit. Likewise, I never spend time observing the café, so I 
cannot firmly state there is no interaction between them and other teams within 
Treasurer's House. However, given that the café is located in the basement – and on 
the opposite side of the basement from the stairs as well – it is highly doubtful that 
any of the teams would go out of their way to interact with the staff there.  
 
The volunteers seem even more isolated, both from the paid staff and from each 
other. There is only ever one guide per room, and the only method of communication 
they have on them is a personal alarm that hangs around their neck that they can 
press in case of an emergency. They are reliant on the volunteer team leader to 
move from room to room and ensure that everything is running smoothly. To be fair 
to the volunteer team leaders, they do this regularly and to a timetable, so that the 
volunteers know when to expect their team leader and when they can take a break. 
However, given the scale of the property and how spread out the volunteers are, the 
lack of means to communicate between people and teams is slightly worrying. 
 
The lack of interaction and communication between groups not only makes for a 
more isolating experience, but also makes it more difficult to identify and fix barriers 
to accessibility. During my visit with Amy (Treasurer’s House; anxiety, hypermobility, 
OCD), she notes that the door to the toilets was very heavy and she worries about 
visitors not being able to move it (Appendix C 4.3). I subsequently mention the heavy 
door to front of house staff members, but they are completely unaware of the issue 
(Appendix G 3.1), presumably because they have a staff toilet to use and therefore 
do not use the public toilets. However, when I mention the heavy door to volunteers 

276 
 
at the property, they nod understandingly and comment that they agree it is too 
heavy, but also that they are unsure who to talk to about this particular issue 
(Appendix G 3.1). If there is more communication between teams, it is possible that 
not only would more people be aware of the heavy door, but that someone would 
know who to pass this feedback to and thereby fix the problem. 
 
Communication between teams at Abbey House is more embedded within their 
everyday practice, perhaps because their staff teams are not as numerous. They 
have a front of house team, cleaning team, manager team, café team, and technical 
team. The front of house team can be divided further into an admissions team and a 
floor team, based on where the staff member is positioned. During my visits and 
observations, I never see admissions staff and floor staff switch places, although 
when I ask about the division of labour, staff member Danni explains to me that they 
all belong to the same pool of staff members, and everyone chooses which position 
they would like to stay at during the day (Appendix G 1.1). She also explains that 
people are welcome to swap positions throughout the day, but most people prefer 
either admissions or the museum floor (Appendix G 1.1).  
 
When I visit with Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, EDS) and Kasi (Abbey House; 
ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, EDS), we have a pushchair with us and therefore need 
to use the small platform lift to avoid the two steps between the admissions area and 
the Victorian Street. As we leave the admissions desk, the staff member there radios 
to another staff member that someone is coming through to use the platform lift. By 
the time we made it to the platform lift, this second staff member is standing there, 
waiting to welcome us and help us to use the platform lift. Both Teagan and Kasi 
comment on how smooth the interaction is, that it is a small gesture but one that is 
significant to their experience (Appendix D 8.2).  
 
Although the interactions I see at Abbey House are limited, the wider atmosphere of 
the museum “family” is evident in many comments made by both staff and 
participants alike. Stephen, a staff member at Abbey House, tells me the staff “is like 
a big family, no matter [what position] you work. Everyone talks to everyone, shares 
their experiences with everyone” (Appendix G 1.1). Ella echoes this sentiment in her 
comment that Abbey House is her “home away from home” (Appendix G 1.1). Some 

277 
 
of this fondness can be attributed to the forced separation that came from the first 
national lockdown, but Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety) makes a similar comment during 
our interview in November 2019, well before the onset of the pandemic. Her partner 
works for Abbey House and Lisa comments that “this is one of the friendlier 
museums, I think probably because it's smaller” (Appendix C 9.3). Although both 
Treasurer's House and Barley Hall are described as “friendly” by the participants and 
staff members I interview, only Abbey House is described as a “family” or a “home 
away from home,” implying a great amount of interaction between staff members.  
 
Barley Hall is not described in quite so glowing terms, but it has a similar level of 
team interaction. Like Abbey House, Barley Hall has a front of house team, a 
cleaning team, a manager team, and a technical team, although unlike Abbey 
House, I do not see any members of the technical team during my visits with 
participants or my observations. Again, I have limited opportunity to observe 
interactions between staff, but even with these limited opportunities, I do see 
managers interacting with front of house staff on multiple occasions. Given the 
nature of these interactions, I discuss them further in section 8.3 below. 
 
A unique aspect of Barley Hall, however, is that staff members do more than interact 
with other teams; some staff members move between teams. At least two members 
of the front of house staff are also part of the management team, serving as duty 
managers from time to time. Additionally, one front of house staff from Barley Hall is 
also a member of the cleaning crew. The permeability of these teams necessarily 
means that there is communication between them, as staff members interact with 
each other under a variety of circumstances and in a variety of roles. 
 
Although I have limited opportunity to observe team interactions (or the absence of 
them) at my case study sites, my initial findings are in line with other research that 
has taken place. Robinson (2019), for example, found that a high degree of 
interdepartmental communication was key to successfully embedding human-rights 
related issues within museums. In order for significant, long-term relationships with 
external communities to be maintained, Robinson maintains that it cannot be only 
curators who are engaging with partner communities, it must also include “designers, 
programmers, and younger professional staff” (2019, 30). Applying this to my case 

278 
 
study sites, particularly as accessibility is a human rights issue, all teams, not only 
the management team, must be involved in uncovering barriers to accessibility 
through communicating with each other and with visitors. Gilmore and Rentschler  
(2002, 6) explicitly state this, saying “interdepartmental cooperation is a prerequisite 
for a museum to deliver excellent service in terms of education, accessibility, and 
communication.” As I see very little interdepartmental cooperation at my case study 
sites, particularly at Treasurer’s House, I am not surprised by the abundance of 
barriers to my participants.  
9.3. Hierarchical Staff Interactions. 
 
“I just don’t understand why we can’t do it!” Jamie hisses.  
 
I’m standing at the admissions desk at Treasurer’s House, and the Christmas 
season is in full swing. The House is decorated for the season, the special 
Christmas scones are available in the café, and families are arriving to meet 
with Father Christmas. In fact, it’s this meet and greet with Father Christmas 
that is causing such a stir at the desk. 
 
Understandably, there is a limited number of children allowed in each session 
with Father Christmas. This is in the days before COVID-19, so the limit is due 
to the size of the space where they meet him rather than a health concern 
regarding social distancing. Still, the limited numbers mean that tickets must be 
pre-booked for each time slot. That’s not the problem. 
 
The problem is that not all the slots are fully booked, yet the admissions desk 
can’t sell more tickets to people who walk in asking for a ticket. On top of that, 
the booking system doesn’t allow people to book tickets online for the same 
day, meaning these slots will remain unsold.  
 
I’ve seen countless families now have to leave, trying to put on a brave face to 
hide the disappointment. It tugs at my heartstrings, and it’s clearly having an 

279 
 
effect on the admissions staff too. They’re still kind and understanding to the 
families they must turn away, but in between visitors, when there’s a lull in the 
admissions area and no visitors are within earshot, the frustration comes out. 
“It’s not like we’d be overbooking a session. And half the time, these people 
aren’t even showing up for their session!” 
 
While that may be a slight exaggeration, it is true that on multiple occasions, 
people who pre-booked a session with Father Christmas did not turn up – and 
for those same sessions, the admissions staff had to turn a family away.  
I ask why this is, and Jamie just shrugs. “We’ve asked and they say they can’t 
do anything about it.”13 
 
The vignette above demonstrates a lack of communication between front of house 
staff and management staff, what I call hierarchical interactions. The lack of 
reciprocal communication – that is, from front of house staff to management staff – 
not only engenders a sense of disempowerment amongst staff, but also prevents 
suggestions, particularly regarding accessibility, from ever being raised. In order to 
fully understand how important balanced hierarchical communication is, I here 
include a second vignette. 
 
Over at Barley Hall, a different system has arisen. Before the pandemic, there 
was no limit to the number of visitors allowed inside at a time, so pre-booking 
tickets was rare and often as part of a multi-site ticket. After the pandemic, 
however, numbers had to be monitored to allow social distancing, meaning all 
tickets had to be pre-booked. 
 
This meant that only 8 visitors were allowed to enter the building every half an 
hour, and at first, there was no ability to sell tickets on the door, just like the 
Father Christmas sessions at Treasurer’s House. As time went on, it became 
                                            
13 As mentioned in Chapter 6, I sent each vignette to the appropriate participant in order to ensure I 
captured their thought process and feelings accurately. Each has been included in this thesis with 
their approval. 

280 
 
clear that this was perhaps overly cautious, and, like the Father Christmas 
sessions, meant that people had to be turned away at the door. The procedures 
then changed: front of house staff were given the ability to sell tickets to walk-
ins, with the understanding that there was space available for a particular time 
slot. If an admissions time slot was sold out, then they still had to turn people 
away or encourage them to book on to a different time slot, depending on the 
availability for the day. Likewise, if pre-booked visitors didn’t show up for 
their allotted time, staff were allowed to admit walk-ins at their discretion.  
Indeed, as I conduct my observations at Barley Hall, the admissions staff 
member, Gwen, is able to admit three groups of walk-ins during the hour that 
I’m with her. 
 
“It’s nice,” Gwen tells me as we discuss the adaptation of the procedure. “They 
trust us to get on with our job.”14 
 
In comparing the two vignettes, the contrast is stark. At Treasurer's House, there had 
already been a dismissive attitude from the front of house staff that they could only 
receive information from management rather than also provide information back to 
them (Appendix G 3.2). At Barley Hall, however, communications appear to flow both 
ways, allowing a better experience for both the visitors who have not pre-booked and 
the staff who interact with them. 
 
The differences at the sites go further than the flexibility of tickets. At Barley Hall, I 
ask about the relationship between the front of house staff and managers. Gwen 
enthusiastically responds that there is a good relationship there, that they “trust our 
responsibility and work ethic, we’re not micromanaged” (Appendix G 2.1). She offers 
examples of front of house staff members taking on various projects, such as 
ensuring all the labels in the shop are standardised, of their own initiative and being 
supported by their managers.  
 
                                            
14 As mentioned in Chapter 6, I sent each vignette to the appropriate participant in order to ensure I 
captured their thought process and feelings accurately. Each has been included in this thesis with 
their approval. 

281 
 
Furthering this theme of trust, I witness several instances where the duty manager at 
Barley Hall begins their hourly walk around by stopping at the admissions desk and 
asking the front of house staff member for an update on the site (Appendix G 2.1). 
As Gwen points out, this is not perceived as an attempt at micromanaging or 
ensuring that the staff member is attending to their duties. Rather, it is understood as 
the manager trusting the front of house staff to tell them if there is anything that they 
should be aware of. For example, during one of their check-ins, George (front of 
house) explains to Kieran (management) that there is a couple in Barley Hall that are 
particularly interested in the architecture of the building, suggesting that Kieran could 
point out some of the original Medieval timbers to them if he encounters them. 
George’s observation is not critical to the experience of the site for the visiting 
couple, but it does highlight the level of feedback that managers are open to at 
Barley Hall. Even a small suggestion that impacts only two visitors is taken seriously 
and, presumably, acted upon.  
 
Gwen also says that managers are very open to suggestions regarding accessibility 
– provided there is capacity (Appendix G 2.1). She specifically refers to enabling 
subtitles on the introduction video that plays at the start of every time slot. A front of 
house staff member suggested that they should be turned on, acknowledging how it 
increased accessibility of the video, and the managers acted upon this suggestion. 
Information flows between staff hierarchies at Barley Hall, and this in turn increases 
the accessibility of the site. 
 
Due to my limited observations at Abbey House, I am unable to observe hierarchical 
interactions between the management and front of house staff. Even when I visit with 
participants, front of house staff and managers have similar dress codes (at Barley 
Hall, the uniform for front of house staff and managers differs, allowing for easy 
identification) and I am therefore unable to discern between the two roles. It is 
possible that I witnessed interactions, but I was unable to understand how they might 
speak to internal staff hierarchies. However, the similar dress codes do present an 
interesting insight into how hierarchy is perceived at Abbey House: there is little 
formality to the hierarchical staff structure in general. Mary may be a senior 
management staff member at Abbey House Museum, and therefore has more power 
and influence, but she does not hold herself apart from the front of house team. 

282 
 
Indeed, this view of a more egalitarian staff structure is in keeping with my 
ethnographic observations at the site. I mention in section 9.2 above that front of 
house staff members feel like their co-workers are more like family, and this feeling 
extends beyond their immediate peers. Again, I do not witness any overt hierarchical 
interactions during my ethnographic observations, but my interviews with front of 
house staff and management are illuminating in this regard. 
 
With Gwen’s example of the Barley Hall subtitles in mind, I include a question about 
implementation of front of house suggestions in my interviews at Abbey House. Tim 
very proudly tells me about their suggestion for a “relaxed” Father Christmas 
encounter, something that has been enthusiastically accepted and implemented by 
the management (Appendix G 2.1). In the more typical Father Christmas sessions at 
Abbey House, children are lined up and brought into the grotto one by one to interact 
with Father Christmas and receive their gift from him. During the relaxed sessions, 
children are all brought into the grotto area together and are allowed to explore the 
area at their own pace and to approach Father Christmas in their own time, if they 
approach him at all. By avoiding enforced social interactions, autistic children and 
children with other social difficulties are more at ease in an otherwise alien and 
potentially scary environment. Again, this suggestion comes from the front of house 
staff, who see first-hand the discomfort of children with social difficulties, rather than 
the management. The dialogue between staff members and management has 
resulted in increasing the accessibility of the site. 
 
I similarly ask Mary (Abbey House) if any accessibility suggestions from front of 
house staff have been implemented. She mentions the relaxed Father Christmas 
sessions, but focuses on another aspect: hand driers. During these relaxed 
sessions, which are primarily aimed at children with sensory difficulties, they turn off 
the hand driers in the toilets which are very loud and quite overwhelming for anyone 
with sensory difficulties (Appendix G 1.4). This too is a suggestion from front of 
house staff, who observed distressed children leaving the toilets because of the 
hand driers. Mary also tells me that for all events aimed at visitors with accessibility 
needs, not only relaxed Father Christmas sessions, they turn the hand driers off 
(Appendix G 1.4). Once again, the hierarchical communication between teams has 
ostensibly increased accessibility at Abbey House.  

283 
 
 
At Treasurer's House, there is a marked difference in the hierarchical interactions. In 
place of witnessing the interactions myself, I ask staff members how comfortable 
they were with their managers. All staff members say they have a positive 
relationship, and they feel they could go to their managers with any problem they 
encounter (Appendix G 3.1). However, as seen in the vignette, the positive 
relationship is not the full story. 
 
During the course of my observations, I comment how dark the admissions area 
becomes during the afternoon, something I discuss in Chapter 8. As it turns out, staff 
members had asked for a desk lamp so that they could see better as they worked in 
a room with little natural light (Appendix G 3.1). However, it took several months for 
the management staff to supply them with a lamp, despite front of house staff 
members continually asking for any updates on the progress of their lamp, a sore 
point amongst the staff I speak to about this incident.  
 
In a later interview with Issy, a front of house staff member, she explains a particular 
cycle she has witnessed at Treasurer's House repeatedly over the years that may 
help to explain the frustration (Appendix G 3.4). She says that whenever new 
elements are introduced to Treasurer's House, there is great excitement at first, with 
lots of discussion within a team about how this could be used to enhance a visitor’s 
experience. Then comes a settling in phase, where people explore how to use the 
new element and incorporate it into their usual workflow. With this settling-in phase, 
new problems and issues arise, issues that the people who actually use the new 
element could not fix. This in turn leads to frustration and annoyance, and by the end 
of the winter season, most people have stopped using the new element. The most 
apparent problem in this cycle is the lack of a feedback mechanism, something that 
is obvious across many aspects of Treasurer's House. In Issy’s cycle, there is no 
way for front of house staff to feedback the issues and problems that have arisen 
through the practical use of the new element. Likewise, across the wider experience 
of Treasurer's House, there is little opportunity for front of house staff to provide 
feedback to their managers.  
 

284 
 
I ask Ellen (Treasurer's House) about any feedback mechanisms they employ. She 
says that staff are always welcome to speak to the duty manager, and she hopes 
that they felt comfortable enough to do so. As mentioned earlier in this section, front 
of house staff members confirm they felt comfortable taking problems to the 
managers, but few of them actually do so. This mirrors what my participants say 
about staff members in section 9.1 above – they feel comfortable approaching staff, 
but they do not necessarily do so. Ellen also explain that at the end of each season, 
staff and volunteers are given a survey to fill out anonymously, reflecting upon their 
experiences throughout the year. The responses from this survey feed into training 
and changes for the next year. However, it should be noted that front of house staff 
operate on temporary contracts that last for one season, and therefore must re-apply 
for another temporary contract the following year. This turnover rate is another 
barrier to communication, particularly regarding accessibility, as staff are unable to 
continue pushing for any suggestions they have put forward. 
 
Ironically, the volunteers at Treasurer’s House occupy a more permanent position, 
as they are not bound to contracts. However, they are likewise dubious that their 
accessibility suggestions would be put into action. As part of my interviews at 
Treasurer’s House, I ask each volunteer one thing they would change regarding the 
accessibility of the property. The results are always enlightening, and I soon begin 
asking staff members the same question. One volunteer, Caitlin, wants the building 
to be warmer and lighter (Appendix G 3.1), echoing what my participants said in 
Chapter 8. She even emphasises that there must be some balance between 
conservation and visitor (and staff) comfort (Appendix G 3.1). Another volunteer, 
Michael, wants the old toilets in the foyer, which are currently not used, to be turned 
into accessible toilets (Appendix G 3.1). As he points out, the only accessible toilet in 
the building is down a flight of stairs, across a narrow room, and then up another 
step. Additionally, as I mention above in section 9.2, the door to the toilets is 
incredibly heavy and difficult to open. Other suggestions include changing the taps in 
the toilets to a lever style, which makes them easier to turn, and reviewing their 
printed material to ensure it was accessible for people with colour vision deficiency15. 
                                            
15 Formerly referred to as “colour-blindness,” colour vision deficiency is now that preferred term in the 
UK (NHS 2021). 

285 
 
At the time, I was unaware of the annual survey, but three volunteers, each of whom 
had been volunteering at the site for at least three years, expressed little hope that 
things would change, signalling a lack of faith in the survey results leading to 
anything (Appendix G 3.1). Although I was not able to view any of these surveys, the 
sense I received from volunteers is that even if they make suggestions in this survey, 
it is highly unlikely that the management would pursue any of these suggestions. 
 
As Gilmore and Rentschler (2002, 6) write in their paper examining the role of 
museum management, “the views of all staff need to be encouraged and be 
accessible to senior management, and senior management should be seen to take 
these views into account and respond to them.” It is clear from my ethnographic 
observations and interviews that the management at Abbey House and Barley Hall 
are living up to the standards of Gilmore and Rentschler, whilst the management at 
Treasurer’s House falls short. Through these hierarchical interactions, new 
accessibility measures have been introduced at Abbey House and Barley Hall, 
creating a more inclusive experience for disabled visitors. By contrast, Treasurer’s 
House, which lacks any significant hierarchical communication, prevents such 
changes from taking place. 
9.4. Discussion. 
Thus far in this chapter, I have shown a variety of interactions at my case study sites. 
Within each type (visitor/staff member, team, and hierarchical staff), communication 
– or more specifically, the lack thereof – is crucial to the accessibility of the site for 
disabled visitors. Barley Hall seems to understand the importance of communication 
between visitors and staff members, as they include an interesting line on their 
website: “Barley Hall staff are trained to uphold our safety procedures, and will be 
happy to answer any questions or note any suggestions you have” (The JORVIK 
Group 2021b). They openly welcome feedback from visitors, but who should initiate 
this conversation, and how?  
 
In examining visitor/staff interactions, there is a feeling from both sides that they 
want some kind of communication, but neither side feels empowered to start the 
conversation. Participants are hesitant to identify their accessibility needs, whilst staff 

286 
 
members do not know when to offer help, nor what kind of help they could offer. To 
an extent, this is another reason why passive accessibility is key in creating inclusive 
environments, as then no one needs to ask or offer, the accessibility measure is part 
of the overall design of the experience. However, passive accessibility is not always 
possible, and even then, many heritage organisations are unsure how to include 
these passive accessibility measures in their offer. I discuss how this hesitancy 
stems from gaps in disability awareness in Chapter 10, demonstrating a kind of 
paralysis for many organisations when enacting accessibility changes. For now, I will 
focus on the method (or lack thereof) of communication between groups in order to 
argue that communication in all interactions is needed to understand the needs of 
visitors with hidden disabilities. 
 
For communication in visitor/staff interactions, most research emphasises the need 
for staff training around disability awareness (e.g., Schitko and Simpson 2012; Bizjak 
et al. 2011; Daruwalla and Darcy 2005). However, I do not believe it is a lack of 
disability training that leads to a lack of communication between visitors and staff. 
Indeed, staff at all three sites receive disability training, as described in Chapter 6, 
and I witness during my observations and site visits staff members interacting with 
visibly disabled people, as well as hearing stories from staff members about 
memorable interactions in the past. The effectiveness of the training is clear to me, 
as staff members are confident in these interactions, offering help or subtly 
responding to a disabled visitor as necessary. Rather than a lack of training, I believe 
the key lies in the lack of signal for accommodation, the lack of cues for 
conversation. Recall how Amy (Treasurer's House; anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) 
says, “I almost wish that they would have gone ‘oh, do you want to sit?’ But of 
course, they wouldn’t have known to do that” (Appendix C 4.3). 
 
In recent years, there has been initiatives to bring awareness to hidden disabilities, 
the most popular and recognisable being the sunflower lanyard scheme (Hidden 
Disabilities 2021b). People with hidden disabilities wear a green lanyard around their 
neck that has sunflowers over it, such as in Figure 41, sometimes with a tag 
attached that gives further instruction. Initially, these tags simply state that the 
wearer has an unspecified hidden disability and that they may need extra assistance. 
Now, wearers can personalise them with their specific hidden disability, such as 

287 
 
fibromyalgia or PTSD, and include symbols to represent what assistance they may 
need. These lanyards are now recognised at airports, shops, on public 
transportation, and, of course, in museums and heritage sites. During the COVID-19 
pandemic, the sunflower lanyard became a shorthand signal for someone who was 
medically exempt from wearing a face mask, and thereby gained more popularity 
and recognition.  
 
Figure 41. Teagan wearing a sunflower lanyard on a train. 
 
At the time of my participant visits, the sunflower lanyard scheme was not as widely 
recognised as it is today. Indeed, at that time, none of my participants wore a 
sunflower lanyard on our site visits, although I now understand that several 
participants (Teagan, Amy, and Ellie) do wear them. I contacted each of these 
participants, asking for their experience in wearing the lanyard and if there has been 
any change in how people interacted with them. Teagan (Abbey House; dyslexia, 
EDS) says that although she does not notice any changes in behaviour from people 
she interacts with, “I will say that the lanyard scheme is helpful when you need to ask 
for help with a hidden disability” (Appendix C 8.5) She gives the example of using a 
toilet that is often for paid guests only – she feels that people would be more likely to 
allow her access if she wears a sunflower lanyard and asks to use their toilet than if 

288 
 
she does not have one, despite the fact that her disability and therefore her need to 
use a toilet immediately, has not changed.  
 
Ellie (Treasurer's House; anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, depression, 
fibromyalgia) has a different view of the sunflower lanyard scheme. She admits that 
she only wears the lanyard when she is visiting somewhere she believes she will 
require extra help, such as train stations. Her reasoning is thus (Appendix C 5.4):  
I honestly don't know if I would wear one now because of the confusion around their 
use by people who are exempt from masks. I have complete sympathy with people 
who can't wear masks but sort of wish that there was another kind of lanyard they 
could use as I think people are much more aware of it now as just a mask exemption 
rather than also an indication of invisible disability! I'm also concerned by their co-
option by some anti-vaccine campaigners/COVID deniers who are abusing the mask 
exemptions. I really feel like the meaning of the lanyard has changed so much over 
the past two years that it's not actually that useful for people with invisible disabilities 
any more. 
 
Amy provides a similar response, writing that sometimes she makes a point of 
wearing her lanyard with her mask to remind people of the original intended use of 
the lanyard. She adds (Appendix C 4.4):  
Unfortunately, I think this is a case of a good thing being taken over by politics and it 
results in the meaning being lost. Part of me feels like I should continue to wear it 
and encourage others to do so as a form of reclaiming, but as the general public 
doesn't seem to be willing to have the conversation about what they are actually for, 
it seems it wouldn't be very useful. 
 
Ellie and Amy make a similar point: the widespread use of the lanyards during the 
pandemic as a shorthand for “medically exempt from mask-wearing” has potentially 
limited the impact of the lanyards. People, staff members included, may only 
recognise the lanyard in its mask-wearing context, and then forget that the person 
wearing a lanyard may require additional help.  
 
Unfortunately, there is little research regarding the efficacy of the sunflower lanyard 
scheme in the tourism industry. There are mentions in dental practice (Carr et al. 
2020) and nursing studies (Maru et al. 2021) suggesting the use of the sunflower 

289 
 
lanyard scheme as a signal that the wearer needs extra assistance. There is also a 
call for submissions regarding museum experiences with the sunflower lanyard 
scheme (Front of House in Museums 2020), but it remains to be seen how effective 
these lanyards are in communicating the needs of people with hidden disabilities. 
Additionally, as Ellie and Amy point out, the lanyard’s original intent has been 
transformed over the course of the pandemic and now represents something 
different to many people.  
 
These lanyards can only go so far in increasing communication between groups, 
however. When it comes to team interactions, the importance of these interactions 
lies in the ability for people to communicate with one another. Where there is no 
interaction, there is no ability to pass suggestions (or warnings) along to co-workers.  
I show how important the ability to interact is in section 9.2 above, where a staff 
member radios another staff member to let them know we are coming to use the 
platform lift. Even this small interaction means that the other staff member had time 
to position themself in the best place to help us, making Teagan feel welcomed and 
included in the museum experience – not to mention, able to even access that area. 
 
The opportunity for communication is equally as important for hierarchical 
interactions. Consider the presence of managers at each site: for Abbey House and 
Barley Hall, the duty manager is required to walk around the site regularly to ensure 
not only the site but also the staff are fine. At Treasurer's House, the managers only 
appear when there are emergencies that require their assistance. The opportunity for 
interaction between the front of house and management teams is nearly non-existent 
at Treasurer's House, while at Abbey House and Barley Hall, interaction between the 
two teams is almost a requirement of the managerial position.  
 
Although I did not speak with anyone at Treasurer's House about these 
observations, I did bring this lack of interaction to the attention of Dr Heather Smith, 
Equity Officer for National Trust. She explains that some duty managers are more 
involved in the day-to-day running of their property, and that Treasurer's House does 
not necessarily reflect the norm across National Trust. She also acknowledges that 
there should be more interaction between the teams, particularly between front of 
house staff and management. To that end, National Trust has recently begun the 

290 
 
process of re-examining the role of duty managers and potentially making the role 
more active and in line with a service model rather than being available solely for 
emergencies. I understand “service model” to mean the service industry, where a 
duty manager is primarily concerned with the everyday details of running a site. The 
service model then is what is employed by both Abbey House and Barley Hall – yes, 
duty managers also have projects and other tasks to accomplish throughout their 
day, but these tasks will always come second to ensuring their site ran smoothly and 
their staff are supported. When I speak to both Maggie (Barley Hall) and Mary 
(Abbey House), they both confirm this interpretation of the role of duty manager at 
their sites (Appendix G 1.3; 2.3).  
 
In examining the hierarchical interactions at my case study sites, I am struck by the 
differences in feedback mechanisms. At Abbey House and Barley Hall, the hourly 
walkaround provides front of house staff with multiple chances each day to feedback 
problems, no matter how small, to their managers. In turn, the front of house staff do 
not feel as if they are interrupting their managers with these issues. They are 
performing their job. Additionally, they feel trusted and empowered, leading them to 
suggest larger changes, such as more inclusive Father Christmas sessions at Abbey 
House or, as discussed in Chapter 8, keeping a new layout instead of reverting to 
the old one at Barley Hall. The different hierarchical levels are in constant 
communication with one another, feeding information back and forth to enhance the 
visitor experience. 
 
At Treasurer's House, however, there is little chance for any communication amongst 
any staff teams. There is the annual anonymous survey, and whilst this is a form of 
feedback and a way for information to flow up the chain rather than down, this is still 
a one-way direction of information. Staff and volunteers, assuming that they bring up 
any problems at all, cannot discuss these problems and potential solutions with their 
managers, nor can managers ask for clarification or more explanation of any 
problems raised by staff members. There is no meaningful discussion here, no 
opportunity for dialogue. Staff feel disempowered and distrusted, as shown in the 
vignette for section 9.3 above, and indeed, there is an air of resignation at 
Treasurer's House when the subject of positive change was brought up, particularly 
involving accessibility. Many staff and volunteers want change and have many ideas 

291 
 
to increase accessibility, but they do not expect anything to happen. As the 
anonymous volunteer, telling me about new iPads that would be introduced to each 
room as an accessibility aid, comments, “I’ll believe it when I see it” (Appendix G 
3.1). 
 
As I had limited opportunity to observe these particular communication dynamics in 
person, it is useful to look at another case study by Lynch and Proverbs (2020). 
Focusing on Knole, a Grade 1 listed building run by the National Trust, the authors 
investigate “how historic listed buildings are adapting to afford access to [disabled 
people] and how this is being achieved in the context of highly complex and 
interdependent legislative, technical, financial and social considerations” (Lynch and 
Proverbs 2020, 2). Whilst the entire study is illuminating and particularly pertinent to 
my research, of immediate interest here is their observations regarding the 
interdependency of management and volunteers in enacting accessibility measures. 
Specifically, they identify the Knole Access Team (KAT) meetings as the primary 
method of suggesting accessibility changes (10-11). As Lynch and Proverbs write 
(10-11):  
The meetings give volunteers a formal opportunity to speak to staff members, in the 
form of ‘an easy discussion’... volunteers are encouraged to research and present 
their ideas prior to consideration. This shows a strong relationship where the paid 
staff take on the responsibilities of their role through a formalised process, with the 
volunteers creating and actioning potential changes through a less formalised 
process. 
 
Although the focus of their research is on the intersectionality of conservation and 
accessibility, their observations of the KAT meetings exemplify how different types of 
interpersonal communications can lead to improvements in accessibility. The KAT is 
made up of people from different teams, including front of house staff, volunteers, 
and management. Their premises team is indirectly involved as well, as the results of 
the meetings are passed on to them. The meeting itself provides team interaction – 
the different teams come together to discuss accessibility, allowing for problem-
solving and brainstorming. There is an understood visitor/staff interaction that 
informs these meetings as well: “volunteers are encouraged to research and present 
their ideas” (Lynch and Proverbs 2020, 10), implying that the volunteers produce 

292 
 
these ideas either from their interaction with disabled visitors or from their own 
experience as a disabled person.  
 
But most interestingly is the hierarchical dialogue inherent to the KAT meetings.  
The authors describe these meetings as “an easy discussion” (10), which I take to 
mean a conversation that allows for a multi-way flow of information, for questions 
and answers and brainstorming amongst KAT members. Volunteers can rely on their 
managers to take their suggestions seriously, just as managers can rely on the 
volunteers to put forward suggestions that would create meaningful change for 
disabled visitors. The authors describe the “strong relationship” between the teams 
(11), and I believe that is a result of the dialogue embedded into these meetings. 
 
The strength of these interactions is not merely the trust and respect engendered by 
dialogue, but in the tangible changes that have taken place at Knole as a direct 
result of the KAT meetings. The authors link a variety of accessibility-related 
changes that have taken place at Knole to the KAT meetings, including a dedicated 
drop off zone for disabled visitors, leaving manual doors open during operating 
hours, and the installation of an induction hearing loop (9-10), a device that allows 
people with hearing aids to connect to a hidden microphone and hear a speaker 
better. I mention these three changes specifically as they represent small changes 
with little to no impact on the fabric of a listed building that also have a minimal cost. 
As I explained in Chapter 3, I do not believe that most accessibility measures need 
to be costly or intrusive. They need to be informed by the lived experiences of 
disabled people, and the case study of Knole that Lynch and Proverbs present 
shows the importance of the three types of interactions I have outlined in this 
chapter. The lived experience of the disabled visitor is understood through 
communication with staff members, normally the front of house staff members. 
These staff members then discuss their observations with other staff members, 
growing their knowledge together and offering suggestions to dismantle barriers. 
Finally, these observations are fed upwards to management, who have the power to 
enact these suggestions in line with other organisational considerations, such as 
budgetary constraints or conservation considerations. 

293 
 
9.5. Summary. 
In reviewing these instances of communication, it is clear that the lack of 
communication in hierarchical interactions is one of the greatest barriers to 
accessibility at my case study sites. The front of house staff are able to not only 
receive feedback from disabled visitors but they are also perfectly positioned to 
make their own observations regarding the accessibility of the site and supply that 
feedback as well. By interacting with other teams, these same staff members are 
able to compare observations and problem-solve solutions to the barriers they see. 
Finally, lower level staff members can feed these observations and suggestions to 
managers, who have the power to implement these suggestions. However, if there is 
a lack of communication in any of these interactions, especially in hierarchical staff 
interactions, the potential for improved accessibility is greatly restricted. The lack of 
communication, however, is symptomatic of a larger problem that I observed at my 
case study sites: gaps in disability awareness. In the next chapter, I explore this 
concept and how it is related to not only lack of communication but also 
active/passive accessibility. 
 
 

294 
 
Chapter 10 – Gaps in Disability 
Awareness. 
 
Standing at the admissions desk at Barley Hall, I’m talking with Gwen about 
all the changes to the site since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
interactive elements have all but vanished, something that Gwen hopes will 
prove to be temporary. The layout of the site has changed, splitting the 
admissions area from the shop and introducing a small video to welcome 
people to the site and explain the context of what they’re about to experience. 
She’s a bit sad about that too, as it means she only interacts with visitors when 
they’re entering or leaving, rather than both, as she did before the pandemic.  
 
But then we come to the subject of the maps that they now hand out to visitors, 
showing the one-way flow of the museum. “I haven’t seen a lot of people really 
use them, honestly. I think they’re a bit of a waste of time. I already have 
enough information to tell them when they arrive.” 
 
This is my opening. I had been very excited when I arrived and saw that Barley 
Hall had introduced maps, as this was something that my participants asked for 
repeatedly, no matter what site they visited.  
 
“It’s interesting you say that,” I reply. “During my research, that’s actually 
something that’s been really popular. It’s pretty easy for us to find our way 
around Barley Hall, we know the place, but some found it really confusing, so 
a map would help them orient themselves. Another one of my participants 
talked about how they used the maps to kind of plan out their time here, 
figuring out what they wanted to see most in case they didn’t have the energy 
to see the whole site.” 
 

295 
 
“Oh,” she says, looking thoughtful. “I hadn’t thought of it that way.”16 
 
 
 
In Chapter 3, I discuss Fleet’s idea of “encoded inhospitality” – unintentionally 
inaccessible coding within social media (2019). Additionally, Capitaine (2016) 
discusses the disconnect between the expectations of hotel managers and disabled 
visitors in regards to accessibility needs. I encountered similar ideas at my case 
study sites, where staff members and even the larger organisation had 
unintentionally created barriers for disabled visitors. I have framed this carelessness 
as “gaps in disability awareness” by which I mean people and organisations are 
unaware of what they do not know, often leading to disabling barriers because they 
do not have the lived experience of being disabled. Because most people do not 
have colour vision deficiency, they may not realise that colour-coded information is 
inaccessible to people who do have colour vision deficiency. There is no malice in 
their decision to use colour-coding, and yet they have created a barrier for others. As 
Gwen says in the vignette above, most places “hadn’t thought of it that way” when it 
came to accessibility measures (Appendix G 2.1). More accurately, they had not 
thought of it at all. There is no overt discrimination meant in their actions and 
attitudes, but still, their ignorance has led to a level of inaccessibility for disabled 
visitors. This unintentional ignorance seems to be the overarching theme of all the 
issues with accessibility that my participants faced, connecting active/passive 
accessibility and lack of communication as the true root cause of the inaccessible 
barriers. 
 
In this chapter, I re-examine the themes of Active vs Passive Accessibility and Lack 
of Communication through the lens of this gap in disability awareness, along with 
offering reflexive comments about how my own gaps in awareness impacted my 
research. I then examine a particular example of these gaps that was commented 
upon by my participants repeatedly: the banister at Treasurer's House. Finally, I end 
with a discussion about the implications of these gaps as well as how to combat it in 
                                            
16 As mentioned in Chapter 6, I sent each vignette to the appropriate participant in order to ensure I 
captured their thought process and feelings accurately. Each has been included in this thesis with 
their approval. 

296 
 
order to create more inclusive, accessible sites. It should be noted that, unlike Active 
and Passive Accessibility and Communication, I did not present this theme to the 
managers my case study sites, as at the time of my interviews, I was still in the 
process of conceptualising its importance and ramifications.  
10.1. Active vs Passive Accessibility.  
In Chapter 8, I discuss three specific barriers my participants encountered (layout, 
lighting, and communal reading) and also put forth their suggestions for mitigating 
these barriers in the context of active and passive accessibility. I now examine these 
barriers through the lens of gaps in disability awareness, arguing that passive 
accessibility opens up the possibility for positive effects despite these gaps.  
 
In examining the other barriers presented in Chapter 8, it is clear that gaps in 
disability awareness are at play within each of these areas. The layout of the 
buildings was not created to exclude disabled people visiting. In some instances, 
such as the thresholds at Barley Hall, they are remnants of a previous era that does 
not translate well to a more accessible-minded present. The thresholds are required 
to hold the house together structurally, a technique that is historically accurate to the 
medieval period the house is supposed to date to. However, in maintaining the 
historical accuracy (and even structural stability), they have created an inaccessible 
site for people with mobility difficulties. The same holds true for the layouts of Abbey 
House and Treasurer's House – when they were adapted as heritage sites, they 
maintained a high level of inaccessibility for people with mobility difficulties. Out of 
the three sites, only one has a lift to reach the upper floors and only one currently 
offers a map to guide visitors around the site.  
 
The same gaps in disability awareness are present in lighting levels – although there 
are arguably no gaps involved here but rather a dearth of acceptable solutions. At all 
three sites, lighting is predicated on the needs of the site, whether in regards to the 
collection or the ambiance of the experience. Even after bringing these barriers to 
the attention of the sites, there is little to imply that lighting levels are a complaint that 
would be given due consideration. Ellen (Treasurer's House) acknowledges that poor 
lighting is an ongoing battle, but implies that conservation would always trump 

297 
 
accessibility needs (Appendix G 3.4). Maggie (Barley Hall) says that she would 
speak with the technical team about what could be done, but the issue of lighting is 
not met with the same enthusiasm that the suggestions of personal interpretation 
boards or retaining maps were (Appendix G 2.3). Mary (Abbey House) agrees that 
lighting has been an issue in the past on the Victorian Street, so they have done 
away with the lighting cycle (Appendix G 1.3). However, her comment does not 
address how dark some of the shop interiors on the Victorian Street are. Although it 
is never verbalised, there is an attitude amongst the managers that they are unsure 
how to find an acceptable solution, one that satisfies accessibility, conservation, and 
energy-efficiency needs equally. 
 
Finally, communal reading, which has been the traditional means of heritage 
interpretation for decades, was never meant to be a barrier to visitors, and yet, it has 
proven to be one of the most significant barriers my participants encountered.  
Large, wall-mounted text panels are seen at most heritage sites and museums 
around the world. However, their ubiquity means that no one has questioned how 
useful they truly are, particularly in terms of accessibility. Studies have been 
conducted about the height of these panels (Bitgood 2016), the font choice and font 
size (Laddusaw and Brett 2019; Smedley 2019), and even their digitization 
(Moscardo 2015), all in an effort to make the panels as accessible as possible.  
 
I myself never questioned that communal reading itself was a barrier to many of my 
participants. My own gaps in disability awareness prevented me from entertaining 
alternative methods of disseminating interpretation. I had initially anticipated 
participants, particularly neurodivergent participants, would prefer aural means of 
interpretation, but I never considered how stressful reading in front of other people 
could be for people with a variety of disabilities. Likewise, I did not expect the 
personal interpretation boards to prove so inclusive, especially as they were not 
designed as an accessibility measure.  
 
In an interesting twist, the personal interpretation boards prove that gaps in disability 
awareness are not insurmountable, and sometimes, these gaps are resolved 
unintentionally. Treasurer's House has introduced these boards, shown in Figure 42, 
as an alternative means of interpretation to the room guides available in each room. 

298 
 
Treasurer's House is in an interesting predicament, as they were bequeathed the site 
with all its contents under the premise that nothing would change (National Trust 
2021g). No furniture removed, no large interpretation panels added, the site needed 
to be preserved exactly how Frank Green left it when he gave it to the National Trust. 
As a means of keeping their promise to Frank but also introducing alternative 
narrative themes, they have created the personal interpretation boards so that 
visitors could learn more about Frank Green himself, specific items of interest within 
the room, or the architectural evolution and influences throughout the property.

However, the boards have proven to be an excellent accessibility tool. Multiple 
participants comment on how they enjoy them and how the boards mitigate barriers 
that my participants encounter. For Jessica (Treasurer's House; dyslexia, Irlen 
syndrome), she can use her overlay without embarrassment (Appendix C 7.2). For 

299 
 
Alfie (Barley Hall; dyslexia, monocular vision), he can pick up the boards and move 
them closer to his face or to an area of the room with better lighting (Appendix C 
2.2). For Lisa (Abbey House; anxiety), she can pick up the panel and move to an 
area where she feels less anxious about reading in front of people (Appendix C 9.3). 
As far as I am aware, none of these instances had been anticipated in the design of 
the boards, but still, my participants benefit from their creation.  
 
The personal interpretation boards and maps prove the efficacy of passive 
accessibility as a means of counteracting gaps in disability awareness, even gaps 
that organisations are unaware of. Passive accessibility measures are, by their 
nature, embedded within a design and therefore are used by everyone. As such, 
they mediate a host of barriers that the original designers of the passive accessibility 
measure could never have anticipated. An automatic door is helpful for wheelchair 
users and people with pushchairs, but it is also helpful for people with arthritis or 
people with their arms full of boxes. Maps are created to help people orient 
themselves within a site, but they can also be used by a visitor to prioritise the 
exhibitions they want to see or to estimate how much energy is needed to see the 
rest of a site. Personal interpretation boards can introduce alternative narratives 
within a site, but they also can be used by people too nervous to use an accessibility 
tool in front of other people or are too nervous around other people altogether.  
10.2. Lack of Communication.  
In Chapter 9, I discuss how the lack of communication between groups creates one 
of the biggest barriers to accessibility. I now examine this lack of communication 
through the lens gaps in disability awareness, arguing that increased communication 
leads to increased accessibility by exposing these gaps.  
 
A common theme amongst both participants and staff members is the inability to 
know how or when to ask for help. Participants want staff members to ask if they 
needed any help (Appendix C 4.3; 6.4; 9.3), whilst staff members want some 
external signal that someone needed help (Appendix G 3.1). Both sides agree that 
staff seem perfectly willing to help if called upon, but participants face a great 
number of barriers in trying to communicate their needs without disclosing their 

300 
 
personal medical history and potentially opening themselves up to abuse (e.g., 
Menendez 2018; Cox 2013).  
 
One such solution is the sunflower lanyard scheme, also discussed in Chapter 9. 
However, as Ellie (Treasurer's House; anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, 
depression, fibromyalgia) says, "I really feel like the meaning of the lanyard has 
changed so much over the past two years that it's not actually that useful for people 
with invisible disabilities any more" (Appendix C 5.4). There is no longer a guarantee 
that staff will acknowledge the sunflower lanyard as anything other than an 
exemption from wearing a facemask, which alters the original purpose of the lanyard. 
True, many people are exempt from wearing a facemask because of their hidden 
disability, but, according to my participants, somehow the ubiquity of the lanyard now 
means far fewer people are going out of their way to help people wearing the 
lanyard. In a way, the increase in awareness has led to an increase in ignorance as 
well.  
 
As facemask wearing seems to be with us for the foreseeable future (Tuñón-Molina 
et al. 2021), I argue that better staff training needs to be implemented. As mentioned 
in Chapter 6, all case study sites provide their staff members with disability 
awareness training of some type. I was unable to obtain details of the disability 
training at Treasurer's House (and indeed, two staff members told me they received 
no such training), but at Abbey House and Barley Hall, this training includes 
awareness of hidden disabilities, particularly dementia and autism. However, as I 
discuss in Chapter 3, there are far more hidden disabilities than dementia and 
autism. It is encouraging that these sites have trained their staff in assisting visitors 
with dementia or autism, but more is needed. There are multiple courses that focus 
on hidden disability awareness, including one from the Sunflower Lanyard Scheme 
itself (Hidden Disabilities 2021b). I have not been able to examine these training 
materials myself, but as Bizjak et al. (2011) shows, even a small amount of exposure 
to disability issues is enough to increase positive attitudes towards disabled people. 
Likewise, Daruwalla and Darcy (2005) demonstrate that ongoing training, particularly 
in the form of refresher courses, maintains that positive attitude, and perhaps that is 
what the staff at my case study sites require: a refresher course. Acknowledging that 
the sunflower lanyard has changed in its cultural meaning, but reminding staff of the 

301 
 
original purpose of the lanyard could go a long way in empowering staff members to 
ask visitors if they need help. 
 
The lack of communication between staff teams also allows gaps in disability 
awareness to fester. At Treasurer's House, teams remain isolated from each other, 
meaning that they cannot discuss observations or encounters. Recall the heavy door 
I mention in Chapter 9 – the admissions staff are unaware of the issue, but the 
volunteer team, who are aware of the issue, do not know how to fix it or who to 
speak to about it. Contrast that with the interaction between teams at Abbey House 
and Barley Hall. Not only do staff communicate within their teams, such as the staff 
member on the admissions desk at Abbey House alerting the staff member near the 
platform lift that someone is coming their way, but they also communicate with other 
teams, such as front of house staff at Barley Hall passing information to managers 
regarding visitors in the attraction. The flow of small, seemingly insignificant details 
between the teams creates an environment for communication and discussion that 
can not only identify problems but also work towards solutions. Perhaps if the 
volunteers and admissions staff at Treasurer's House have better methods of 
communication between their teams, they would have some suggestions for the 
heavy door problem. 
 
Even more critical is the lack of communication between staff across institutional 
hierarchies. As has been mentioned multiple times, Capitaine's (2016) research 
exposes the gaps in disability awareness of hotel managers regarding the needs of 
disabled visitors. These gaps lead them to make a number of inaccurate 
assumptions regarding alterations to their hotel rooms when the reality is that many 
disabled visitors need small accommodations, such as a corner of a room key card 
cut so they know which way to insert the card into the door lock. Likewise, there is a 
significant disconnect between the expectations of the case study site managers and 
the actual needs of my participants. I discuss this disconnect in Chapter 9, but here I 
examine how this disconnect is informed by gaps in disability awareness and the 
lack of communication within hierarchies.  
 
As discussed previously, there is a significant lack of communication at Treasurer's 
House. Not only do front of house staff teams not interact often with management 

302 
 
teams, there is a decided lack of trust in those interactions producing any change. 
The incident of the front desk lamp (Appendix G 3.1) is a perfect example, 
highlighting the effect of the management's gap in awareness: the front of house 
wants a desk lamp in a room that had little to no light-sensitive materials, meaning 
there is little concern for light damage in that room. Yet it still takes management 
months to fulfil the request, potentially because they do not experience the low light 
levels themselves and therefore did not understand the necessity of the lamp. The 
management offices are upstairs in a more modern section of Treasurer's House 
with a modern overhead lighting system. They are not beholden to natural light to 
work, whereas it is the primary light source in the admissions area. Their lack of 
awareness of the working conditions of their staff members leads to a delay in 
improving basic working conditions. Additionally, it creates an environment where the 
front of house staff members do not trust their managers to take their suggestions 
and requests seriously. Every time I mention the lamp to front of house staff 
members in our interviews, they scoff or make some kind of derisive comment about 
how long it took for management to supply the lamp (Appendix G 3.1). The 
volunteers likewise express doubt that promises would be kept, as one volunteer 
eloquently comments "I'll believe it when I see it" (Appendix G 3.1). With so little faith 
in the communication systems at Treasurer's House, many staff members have little 
incentive to question and identify gaps in disability awareness they observe 
throughout the property, as there is little hope for change. 
10.3. The Banister.  
 
At the Treasurer’s House, everyone looks forward to the Christmas season. 
There is a palpable excitement in the air, knowing what is to come. For when 
the Christmas season descends, the Treasurer’s House is decorated for the 
holiday. 
 
Each room has its own special touch. The lobby, where the visitors first enter, 
has a display of over-sized tree baubles webbed together in the fireplace grate. 
The great hall has a large pile of brightly wrapped presents at the hearth. The 
Blue Drawing Room has a small vignette of empty champagne bottles and 

303 
 
glasses, giving the feeling of just missing a lively yet intimate party. Even the 
staircases are spruced up for the holidays, with garlands of greenery and red 
tartan ribbon wrapped around the handrail, shown in Figure 43. 
 
Figure 43. The banister at Treasurer’s House wrapped in a Christmas garland. 
 
But for many, many visitors to the Treasurer's House, this aesthetic prevents 
them from being able to get around the House. The banister of the William and 
Mary staircase, the only staircase that connects the upper and lower floors of 
the northern wing, has a beautiful garland wrapped around it. However, the 
placement of the garland prevents most people from being able to use the 
banister to help themselves traverse the stairs.  
 

304 
 
As we approach the stairs, James almost does a double-take, looking at the 
garland wrapped around the banister. He looks at me, giving me a “can you 
believe this?” expression, and starts his way up the stairs. At the top, he all but 
collapses in the first chair that looks like it isn’t off-limits. I’m struck by the 
fact that there’s no outward sign of his pain – no grimaces, no limping, no sigh 
of relief when he’s finally off his feet. Earlier, he had told me that he was 
experiencing a “medium pain” day, and I can imagine that travelling up the 
stairs without the benefit of a handrail has not helped at all. 
 
Later on, as we are sipping hot chocolate and discussing our visit, I ask him if 
he noticed any barriers as we went around. “Oh yeah, the handrail was such a 
bad idea on accessibility issues. It was just wrong on every level.” 
 
A few minutes later, I ask him if there’s anything the museum should design 
into the exhibition from the beginning. “More handrails, more sort of things 
that you can just pull – even on only two or three steps.” 
 
Finally, I ask him if there’s anything he’d like to tell the museum regarding 
their accessibility. He grins at me. “Guess.” 
 
“Is it going to be handrails?” 
 
“Yes!” he laughs. “Funny that.” 
 
We talk a few minutes longer, making plans for our follow-up meeting. He 
mentions the garland on the banister again, but this time, there’s no humour in 
his voice. “It may not seem like anything to them, but it makes a big 
difference.”17 
 
                                            
17 As mentioned in Chapter 6, I sent each vignette to the appropriate participant in order to ensure I 
captured their thought process and feelings accurately. Each has been included in this thesis with 
their approval. 

305 
 
 
James is not alone in his despair over the garland on the banister. It is mentioned by 
every single participant that visited the Treasurer’s House during the Christmas 
period. Amy (Treasurer's House; anxiety, hypermobility, OCD) puts it most 
eloquently: “[it was like it] hadn’t even crossed their mind that that might be an issue” 
(Appendix C 4.3). 
 
The banister serves as a perfect example of the impact of gaps in disability 
awareness. As the staff decorate Treasurer's House, they are more concerned with 
aesthetics than with practicality. This is understandable, as the aesthetic value of the 
decorations is their primary purpose. However, aesthetics and accessibility need not 
compete with each other. Simply hanging the garland along the side of the banister, 
shown in Figure 44, rather than on top of it, shown in Figure 45, would satisfy both 
conditions. It is a small detail, but one that has a significant impact on most of my 
participants’ visits to Treasurer's House. James and Amy’s comments have already 
been mentioned, but Ellie (Treasurer's House; anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, 
depression, fibromyalgia) likewise comments that “even if you don't have any 
accessibility issues, it's just kind of natural. You go to grab a banister, but you just 
get a battery pack in your hand” (Appendix C 5.3). Aaron (Treasurer's House; 
autism, bipolar disorder, OCD) does precisely that during our site visit – he reaches 
for the banister but instead grabs the garland (Appendix D 1.2). He immediately 
withdraws his hand and continues up the stairs without any aid, despite being slightly 
unsteady on his feet. Likewise, during my observations, I notice multiple visitors 
perform the same action: they reach out to use the banister, only to immediately 
withdraw their hand when they either see or touch the garland that is in the way 
(Appendix G 3.1).

307 
 
 
Figure 45. The William and Mary staircase at Treasurer’s House with an inaccessibly hung garland. 
Interestingly, the original design of the decorations avoids this particular problem. 
According to Alice, who is in charge of overseeing the design and installation of the 
decorations, the garland is always meant to hang along the side of the banister so 
that it would not impede visitors’ use of the banister (Appendix G 3.1). However, the 
original intention had not been communicated to the volunteers who hung the 
banister, and instead this unfortunately memorable situation was created. 
 
As passive accessibility is an accessibility measure built into the design, the banister 
is a passive accessibility aid. All of my participants to Treasurer's House use (or 
attempted to use) the banister as they traverse the staircase (Appendix D 1.3; 4.3; 
5.3; 6.3). Likewise, during my observations, it is rare that, once the garland has been 

308 
 
adjusted, a visitor does not use the banister (Appendix G 3.1). Although perhaps not 
intentionally built to help people with mobility difficulties use the stairs, it now can be 
viewed as one of many passive accessibility measures across not only Treasurer's 
House but in buildings across the world. However, the ignorant placement of the 
garland takes away the passivity of the banister. Indeed, the garland takes away its 
usefulness altogether. Neither active nor passive, it is no longer an accessibility 
measure at all.  
 
Additionally, the miscommunication represents a lack of communication across the 
staff hierarchy at Treasurer’s House and potentially a lack of within-team 
communication as well. As mentioned above, the original design has the garland 
hanging to the side of the banister, leaving the banister free for people to use. Alice 
specifically notes that it has been designed with accessibility in mind. However, that 
intention is never communicated to the people who installed the garland. Admittedly, 
I was not present whilst Treasurer's House was being decorated, but given the 
miscommunication, I can only assume that Alice – or at least someone who was 
familiar with the intent of the design – was not present as the garland was being 
placed. The instruction was given, and then the management team moved to a 
different area to take care of another task. In such an instance, the volunteer team 
was unable to ask questions regarding the placement, to seek clarification, or even 
to accept correction from someone familiar with the intended design.  
 
Even once the garland has been placed, it takes nearly a month for it to be 
corrected. I am unsure of the exact date it is fixed, but my participants note the 
garland throughout November. When I begin my observations on 8th December, the 
garland is still hung inaccessibly. When I return on the 16th, it had been fixed. This 
may seem a trivial detail in the wider scheme of accessibility, but all five of my 
participants who encounter the garland-strewn banister take issue with it. Multiple 
visitors I observe also have difficulties with it. Yet it still takes at least three weeks for 
the problem to be corrected, during the busiest time of year for Treasurer's House, 
and I can only wonder: how many people are negatively affected by this mistake – 
an example of a gap in disability awareness on the part of Treasurer’s House?  
 

309 
 
Interestingly, when I visit Treasurer’s House in July 2021 to observe the COVID-19 
changes, the banister once again catches my eye. Similar to the Christmas 
decorations that festooned the banister before the pandemic, there is now a long 
length of blue foam that covers it, as seen in Figure 46. When asked about this, my 
tour guide explains that it has to do with the new cleaning procedures. Too much 
sanitizing spray is destructive to the wood, so the banister is wrapped in foam to 
protect the wood and also allow for increased cleaning, which keeps visitors safe. 
The crucial difference, however, is that this blue foam does not prevent people from 
using the banister.  
 
It does not escape my attention that conservation concerns are paramount to the 
installation of the blue foam, nor that aesthetic appeal is sacrificed in favour of 
preservation. Given how long it took for Treasurer’s House to adjust the garland, I 
highly doubt accessibility would ever triumph in the same way that conservation has.

10.4. Filling the Gaps. 
It would be reductive to say that the barriers to inclusion stemming from 
active/passive accessibility and lack of communication are ultimately caused by gaps 
in disability awareness on the part of my case study sites. The truth is far more 
nuanced, and indeed, I believe these themes all feed into each other. Passive 
accessibility measures, such as maps or personal interpretation boards, can expose 
gaps in disability awareness by mitigating a barrier that heritage organisations were 
unaware even existed. However, these gaps also mean that places are unaware of 
the passive accessibility measures that their site (and their visitors) could benefit 
from. Likewise, communication can expose gaps in disability awareness, but these 
gaps can also feed and encourage lack of communication. As shown in the banister 
example above, there is a complex network of all three elements that lead to 
inaccessibility, however unintentional.  
 
At the heart of it, however, gaps in disability awareness comes from ignorance, and 
the only way to combat such ignorance is through knowledge sharing and the 
unlearning of problematic behaviours. Let us take the common refrain from multiple 
voices in my research: staff, and indeed, organisations, simply do not know where to 
start. All three case study sites expressed a desire to understand how to increase 
accessibility for visitors with hidden disabilities, but these same sites did not know 
how to obtain this knowledge. As discussed in Chapter 3, very little research has 
been conducted in the particular area of accessibility for people with hidden 
disabilities, and no research has incorporated a great level of detail in understanding 
these accessibility needs. But likewise, my participants were unaware of the 
structural barriers that prevented their suggestions from being put into action. 
Indeed, at the beginning of my research, I was unaware of these structural barriers 
as well.  
 
But these gaps were also precisely the reason I focused on the lived experience of 
people with hidden disabilities. They are the experts with embodied knowledge of 
living with their disabilities and their accessibility needs. Likewise, I wanted to 
understand what was preventing these changes from taking place, and as such 
focused on the organisational view of accessibility as well. Bridging the divide 

311 
 
between disabled visitor and service provider, as Capitaine (2016) had done, was 
the only way I could see to truly address the problem of inaccessibility for people 
with hidden disabilities.  
 
Numerous academic sources (Mullins and Preyde 2013; Figueiredo et al. 2012; 
Blichfeldt and Nicolaisen 2011; Burns et al. 2009; Shaw and Coles 2004) and best 
practice guides (Kids in Museums 2018; Heritage Lottery Fund 2012) encourage 
speaking directly to disabled people to understand their perspectives and to learn 
from them. If it is agreed that speaking with disabled people is the best avenue, why 
are so many places hesitant to do so? In examining the literature, there are 
potentially several reasons offered as to why many places still are hesitant to engage 
in this kind of research with disabled people. A particularly salient reason as outlined 
by the Office for Disability Issues (2010, 17) is that people are afraid of making 
mistakes with disabled visitors and thereby making the situation worse. Although no 
staff members expressed their fear in these terms, I believe that this was at the heart 
of many of their comments regarding not knowing how to help (Appendix G 1.1, 3.1). 
Staff and volunteers understood they needed to explain the physical barriers of their 
site to a wheelchair user, but should they offer, for example, a seat to a healthy-
looking young woman? They do not 'look' disabled, and staff members were hesitant 
to offer assistance and potentially embarrass – or even offend – a nondisabled 
visitor.  
 
Multiple articles, written by both academics (e.g., van Jaarsveldt and Ndeya-Ndereya 
2015; Cooper 1994) and disabled people (e.g., Weinstein 2021; Iezzoni 1998), 
discuss the paralysis that nondisabled people often experience when faced with a 
potentially uncomfortable interaction with a disabled person. Authors van Jaarsveldt 
and Ndeya-Ndereya (2015, 205) examine attitudes towards disabled students by 
university lecturers. A wide variety of attitudes are present, but in particular, "one 
lecturer, for example, removed a theme relating to visual analysis of literature from 
the curriculum so as not to offend a student with a visual impairment." Rather than 
risk an uncomfortable situation with a disabled student, the lecturer removed an 
entire lesson from a class. This avoidance robbed the students of an interesting 
class discussion, but also robbed the lecturer of an opportunity to better understand 
inclusive classroom etiquette. 

312 
 
 
Iezzoni (1998), immediately following a discussion of being professionally invalidated 
by a fellow medical doctor, discusses how "political correctness" has actually made 
polite encounters more emotionally fraught. A wheelchair user herself, she writes 
(1998, 663):  
Heightened semantic sensitivities undoubtedly chill some efforts at conversation with 
people who have disabilities. Our conversational partners are afraid of offending. 
Although I appreciate these difficulties, I believe they are quickly transcended by 
expressions of mutual respect and genuine interest, even if awkwardly phrased, and 
simple actions (for example, sitting down to be on the same eye level). 
I found this same fear in the staff I interviewed. They were unsure how to approach 
the subject of disability and accessibility with visitors who could potentially benefit 
from such conversations, simply out of the fear of offending them. 
 
Iezzoni's point about language is particularly interesting to me. Although she wrote 
her article in 1998, her argument is even more relevant today. In the decades since 
her article, the debate between "person first" and "disability first" language has only 
become more pronounced. I discuss this debate in Chapter 1, as well as my use of 
"people with hidden disabilities" based on the preferences of my participants. In 
many ways, disability studies has been overwhelmed by semantic debates. Although 
the linguistic framing of disability is important, as it shapes how a person or society 
views disabled people (Corker 2007; Harpur 2012b), it is also important to move past 
this particular debate. It creates the politeness paralysis that Iezzoni (1998) 
describes, or worse, it creates the over-compensation that van Jaarsveldt and 
Ndeya-Ndereya (2015) describe, neither of which help to dismantle barriers to 
accessibility.  
 
Encouragingly, the National Trust is attempting to bridge the divide between 
semantic discourse and practical implementation. In July 2020, their new Strategy for 
2025 was published, changing their motto from “forever, for everyone” to “for 
everyone, for ever,” as previously discussed in Chapter 6. The semantic implications 
of this word change are enormous. Instead of focusing primarily on preservation, 
there is a new focus on the people aspect of their sites. On the webpage announcing 
the new strategy, the National Trust writes “underpinning this [motto change] is our 

313 
 
renewed commitment to diversity and inclusion and playing our part to create a fair, 
equal society, free from discrimination” (National Trust 2021c). There is still a heavy 
emphasis on environmental responsibility, but there is also an emphasis on 
increasing accessibility. Digging deeper in the brand strategy document they 
released, there is little additional information about their access strategy, other than 
“we’ll make our places better for people who need support to access them, working 
through partnerships and testing new approaches” (National Trust 2020, 17) and a 
case study side-bar about monthly handling sessions for people with dementia and 
their carers at Wimpole Farm. 
 
However, on the National Trust website, they included a 2021 update on their 
commitment to inclusion and diversity (National Trust 2021f). Reading through this 
page, it is clear that “access” is more than accessibility, and rightly so. Access to 
heritage is an issue related not only to disability, but also to ethnicity, LGBTQ+ 
identity, gender, age, and economic situation. The National Trust, through this 
renewed commitment, is attempting to address all of these matters. They include a 
list of positive, measurable, practical steps they have taken to address the inequality 
that has existed in the organisation before. Relevant to my research is the note that 
the National Trust has “continued to deliver training on Everyday Inclusion, and 
developed training for Recruitment and Disability Awareness” (National Trust 2021f). 
Without embedding the practical step of training, the change of phrasing would be 
little more than an act of lip-service to the communities they are trying to reach, 
including disabled people.  
 
Although they have not introduced new mottos, my other case study sites are equally 
eager to implement new accessibility measures. During my observations, it was clear 
to me that there is a culture of accessibility embedded within their operations. At 
Abbey House, the education officer doubles as an accessibility officer. All the staff 
members I spoke to knew the accessibility limitations of their site, but also the tools 
they offer to mitigate these barriers (Appendix G 1.1). During my very first meeting 
with Mary, where I invited Abbey House to be one of my case study sites, a flier for a 
new exhibition at a different LMG site arrived. Mary, along with the 
education/accessibility officer, critiqued the design of the flier, saying that they had 
broken several style guidelines that had been put in place specifically for 

314 
 
accessibility. Although this does not reflect well on the wider LMG culture, it does 
illustrate how accessibility permeates every aspect of Abbey House. Likewise, at 
Barley Hall, accessibility is now considered in each decision that affects the visitor 
experience. The development of the COVID-19 video, discussed in Chapter 6, is an 
example of the embedded culture of accessibility. I cannot speak to how long it took 
for Abbey House to create this culture of accessibility, but from my own experience 
at YAT, it has taken several years for the organisational culture there to shift towards 
a more inclusive mindset. 
 
As previously discussed in Chapter 8, Mary (Abbey House) and Maggie (Barley Hall) 
were both enthusiastic about the inclusions of maps and personal interpretation 
boards (Appendix G 1.3; 2.3). Mary commented that Abbey House had intended to 
produce maps, but based on my participants' suggestion, they would make the map 
a higher priority (Appendix G 1.3). Likewise, Maggie revealed there had been 
discussions of removing the map from circulation, but based on feedback from my 
participants as well as the front of house at Barley Hall, they would keep the maps 
(Appendix G 2.3). I provided her with the feedback that Teagan had shared with me, 
and Maggie agreed to pass these suggestions along as well. 
 
Additionally, Maggie informed me that Barley Hall formerly utilised personal 
interpretation boards several years ago, but when Barley Hall was refurbished in 
2011, these boards were replaced with the larger wall-hanging text panels (Appendix 
G 2.3). However, she was excited to hear how popular these smaller boards were 
amongst my participants and would speak to the interpretation team about bringing 
them back into circulation in future exhibitions. She also intended to speak to the 
travelling exhibitions team about incorporating smaller boards into their exhibitions. 
 
Although I was unable to present my research directly with Treasurer's House, their 
reaction to the banister is in keeping with Abbey House and Barley Hall's attitude. 
Once the issue was noticed, they remedied the problem. Additionally, the rebranding 
of National Trust to “for everyone, forever” is another step towards more accessible, 
inclusive sites. All three case study organisations demonstrated gaps in disability 
awareness, but more importantly, they demonstrated a willingness to fill these gaps 
in order to better welcome disabled visitors.

10.5. Summary. 
In examining all the evidence that I have collated through my interviews and site 
visits with participants with hidden disabilities, as well as my observations at case 
study sites and interviews with staff members, it became clear to me that gaps in 
disability awareness informed every interaction and every barrier that was 
encountered. Active/passive accessibility and lack of communication both inform and 
are informed by gaps in disability awareness. It is only by consciously breaking the 
cycle of this ignorance that my case study sites have been able to move forward, 
implementing measures to increase accessibility at their sites for visitors with hidden 
disabilities.  
 
In the next chapter, I reflect on these lessons and discuss where I hope my research 
will lead next, as well as potential avenues of further investigation that would benefit 
both disabled visitors and heritage sites. 
 
 

316 
 
Chapter 11 – Conclusion. 
The aim of this research has been to understand the accessibility needs of people 
with hidden disabilities as well as the organisational barriers that prevent these 
needs from being met. As a heritage archaeologist working within the sector, as well 
as someone with hidden disabilities, I never believed that my participants’ 
accessibility needs were complicated, nor did I see the organisational barriers as 
being insurmountable. Indeed, at the outset of my research, I believed that the 
answers to disabling barriers would likely entail small adjustments that took little to 
no monetary investment on the part of the organisations. 
  
The truth is more complex than my original assumptions. True, the accessibility 
needs of my participants are more uniform than I expected, in that many of the 
barriers they encountered were consistent across multiple disabilities. These 
included confusing layouts, poor lighting levels, and forced communal reading, all 
discussed in Chapter 8. Additionally, the solutions and suggestions they offered – 
particularly maps and handheld interpretation boards – mostly entail small 
adjustments that could have profound, positive impacts on visitors, disabled and 
nondisabled alike, without being too costly. The maps in particular are a low-cost 
solution, as they require time to design and a cost to print, but little else. Indeed, 
Barley Hall found the cost so minimal that, once their usefulness to visitors had been 
proven through visitor and staff feedback as well as feedback from my research, they 
kept the maps, despite initially seeing them as a temporary COVID-related measure. 
Abbey House and Treasurer’s House likewise had planned to introduce maps, and 
thanks to the recommendations from my research, Abbey House intends to 
accelerate these plans. 
  
The organisational barriers, however, have proven to be more significant than I 
expected, particularly around lack of dialogue as discussed in Chapter 9. It is no 
small task to change how staff interact with each other, especially when so much 
time and effort is spent on training staff members to interact with visitors. Not to 
imply that this training is unimportant – in fact, I recommend more comprehensive 
training for public-facing staff members, particularly including awareness of hidden 

317 
 
disabilities. However, the lack of dialogue between staff teams and especially 
between staff across institutional hierarchies presents a significant barrier to 
implementing better accessibility measures at heritage sites.  
  
Additionally, the pervasiveness of gaps in disability awareness has been startling for 
me, as discussed in Chapter 10. Such gaps are demonstrated in multiple ways at my 
case study sites. From the beginning, there was a lack of awareness as to what 
barriers visitors with hidden disabilities would encounter at these sites, with an 
assumption on the part of management that visitors with hidden disabilities would 
require large, resource-intense accessibility tools in order to enjoy their visit. More 
worryingly, at times, my case study sites adjusted their visitor experiences in ways 
that unfairly impacted disabled visitors, such as Treasurer’s House bannister issue 
and the introduction of guided tours as the only means of experiencing Treasurer’s 
House. Although these examples do not represent insurmountable obstacles, it will 
take time to reveal additional gaps beyond what I have uncovered through this 
research. Recall how Pfeiffer critiqued the ICF (2000, 1082), saying that what was 
needed was not another dictionary of impairments but rather a “philosophical 
revolution to change the dominant values of worldwide society.” Perhaps uncovering 
and educating heritage organisations around gaps in disability awareness is the 
revolution he is looking for? If so, then how can such gaps in knowledge be 
challenged and overcome? 
 
As demonstrated by my interviews and site visits with my participants, gaps in 
disability awareness must be challenged through inquiry and curiosity. This means 
asking disabled people not only about their experiences within museums and 
heritage sites, but also about their everyday lived experiences, particularly as hidden 
disabilities are known to have different symptoms from day to day. Indeed, my own 
research is one step along the path. But also, challenging gaps in knowledge means 
a great deal of reflection is necessary for heritage organisations to understand their 
own short-comings. Remember that in the social and human rights models of 
disability (discussed in Chapter 1), it is society that disables an individual. Therefore, 
we must consider the fact that heritage institutions themselves may be disabling their 
visitors, and hence it is the responsibility of those institutions to dismantle barriers 
with input from their visitors.

11.1. Reflections. 
The world I originally designed my research in was not the world that I conducted my 
research in, nor is it the world in which I now publish my results. Embarking upon 
doctoral research is inherently fraught with uncertainty, but when I began in 2018, I 
could never have foreseen the fundamental, global change that would be the 
COVID-19 pandemic. However, as I discuss in Chapter 7, I believe the pandemic 
presented opportunities that likewise I never could have foreseen. Additionally, my 
own supervisory team changed in ways that I could not have foreseen - one person 
retired, another left academia for a new job, and unfortunately, one passed away. A 
great amount of intellectual agility and sensitivity was required on my part to not only 
adapt my research methodology but also to incorporate the substantial changes that 
took place within my personal sphere, the heritage industry and the world at large. I 
can now reflect upon the longer-term implications of COVID-19. Not only are people 
still being infected with COVID-19, Long COVID is a significant worry. Teagan 
experienced Long COVID, and although the primary symptoms have ended, she is 
still concerned she may be experiencing neurological damage from the illness. 
Additionally, deaths from COVID-19 may have declined, but infection rates are not 
declining at the same rate.  
  
During a personal conversation with Dr Heather Smith in July 2021, she observed 
that as places were opening back up after lockdown, disabled people were becoming 
more isolated. Disability advocates have likewise pointed out that as people are 
moving back to “normal,” they are leaving the digital spaces that had become so 
ubiquitous during the height of the pandemic (Shakespeare et al. 2021; Taylor 2021; 
Pring 2020). By Autumn 2021, the UK Government was urging people to return to 
their offices instead of working from home and facemasks were no longer 
mandatory. Even in 2022, there was a wide variety of working arrangements, but 
fully remote working had fallen to 14% (Office for National Statistics 2022).  
  
To make matters worse, COVID-19 still represents a very real threat for disabled 
people. Not only are they still at a higher risk of developing potentially fatal 
complications if they catch the virus (World Health Organization 2021c), medical 
facilities and staff are under a great amount of pressure thanks to the rising cases 

319 
 
(Triggle 2021). This pressure has meant that other medical services have been 
scaled back to accommodate more COVID-19 patients and disabled people are 
bearing the brunt of it, having their regular, necessary appointments rescheduled or 
cancelled entirely (British Medical Association 2021). None of this considers the 
additional increase in mental health issues (Abbott 2021; Mental Health Foundation 
2021). Studies into the pandemic-related mental health crisis examine the whole 
population, not only the disabled population (Talevi et al. 2020; Usher, Durkin, and 
Bhullar 2020), so it is difficult to determine the exact extent of the impact on disabled 
people, but it is a safe assumption that they are at least as impacted as the rest of 
the population.  
  
Shifting governmental restrictions around COVID-19 have meant the visitor 
experience at my case study sites has been constantly evolving, even as I am 
handing in this thesis. The COVID-related changes at my case study sites have been 
a direct result of governmental guidelines and do not necessarily consider visitor 
feedback, particularly disabled visitor feedback. Because these changes were a 
result of governmental guidelines, I believe many sites were eager to undo these 
changes once the guidelines were removed. During the summer of 2022, when it 
seemed as if the COVID-19 restrictions would soon end, there was discussion at 
these sites about reverting back to the pre-pandemic experience wholesale without 
considering the benefits of any of the alterations they had made in the face of the 
pandemic. At Barley Hall, management originally intended to return to their pre-
pandemic layout and to remove maps of the site. As testified to in Chapter 8, many 
disabled visitors found it difficult to navigate Barley Hall with this layout and previous 
lack of maps. Initially, no consideration was given to how these two changes had 
turned into accessibility measures – another example of a gap in disability 
awareness. Worse, there are some cases where disabled people’s experience is not 
only forgotten but ignored entirely. I discussed the City of York Council’s decision to 
remove Blue Badge parking spaces from the city centre during the pandemic in 
Chapter 2. In late November 2021, the Council voted to make the ban permanent, 
citing a desire to allow for appropriate social distancing and also to protect public 
safety from “hostile vehicle attacks” (BBC Yorkshire 2021), despite repeated protests 
from disabled people highlighting the discrimination inherent in this particular ban. 

320 
 
Indeed, the York Disability Rights Forum is planning on launching a legal challenge 
to this ban, citing discrimination (Walton 2021). 
  
As seen in the Blue Badge Ban example above, decisions are being made that affect 
disabled people without any input from them. “Nothing about us without us” has been 
the motto disability rights advocates in the UK have rallied behind for decades 
(Werner 1998), and yet the message still has not been absorbed by wider society. 
My research has been an attempt to address this gap, to include disabled people 
and their expertise at the heart of the visitor experience at heritage sites in the north 
of England. I have found it an incredibly enriching experience, and although I believe 
the themes uncovered in my research have implications that can change the 
heritage sector, I particularly want to highlight the importance of communication, and 
especially dialogue, within organisations. I have been fortunate that my case study 
sites and the organisations that run them are committed enough to examine the 
barriers embedded within their structure. For example, in 2020, the JORVIK Group 
was awarded the Accessible and Inclusive Tourism award from Visit York (Jefferson-
Brown 2020). During the ceremony, the announcers spoke of how there was no 
short-list for this award, unlike the other award categories, as there was only one 
competitor, and that was the JORVIK Group.  
  
Addressing accessibility through physical alterations, particularly active accessibility 
measures, does not solve the deep-rooted ableism that most people grow up with 
and may never question. In the end, my initial hypothesis was correct: better 
accessibility need not be expensive or intrusive. Better accessibility requires 
thoughtful consideration and introspection on an organisational level. It is not enough 
to ask disabled people about their experience and the barriers they encounter – 
organisations must examine how these barriers were put in place to begin with. They 
need to involve staff members at every level, and they need to listen to staff 
members at every level. Only with open communication and true dialogue, like I saw 
at Abbey House Museum, involving everyone that accessibility touches, disabled 
and nondisabled alike, will lasting, sustainable change be made. 

321 
 
11.1.1. Reflections on Abbey House Museum. 
At Abbey House, there is no doubting their commitment to increasing accessibility for 
their visitors, which I discuss in Chapter 5. Likewise, their unique egalitarian staff 
structure creates a supportive environment where any suggestion regarding 
accessibility is given due consideration. Communication between teams, especially 
between front of house staff and management staff, fosters discussion around 
accessibility measures, which in turn benefits disabled visitors. This culture of 
communication is seen in the relaxed Father Christmas sessions, discussed in 
Chapter 8, where a front of house staff member suggested these relaxed sessions in 
direct response to a particular encounter with a disabled visitor. Not only did 
management enact this suggestion, they also took the suggestion a step further by 
turning the hand dryers in the toilets off during other inclusive events. In this way, 
discussions between multiple different groups (i.e., visitor/staff, staff teams, 
hierarchical) lead to more accessible, inclusive visitor experiences. 
  
Because of examples like the relaxed Father Christmas sessions, I believe that 
where Abbey House falls short is not in their lack of communication but rather in their 
gaps in disability awareness. Mary freely admits that her staff are unsure how to help 
visitors with hidden disabilities, something that is confirmed in my front of house staff 
interviews discussed in Chapter 9. Staff members can – and do – make their own 
observations, but to my knowledge, they conduct little to no internal research 
themselves with disabled groups. However, they have an active disabled community 
around them in Leeds. Local disability organisations provide a link between the 
museum and disabled people themselves, and utilising the methodology laid out in 
my thesis, I believe they can connect directly with disabled visitors to dismantle more 
barriers within Abbey House. 
11.1.2. Reflections on Barley Hall. 
Barley Hall has similar strengths in their staff communications. Although the staff 
hierarchy is not as egalitarian as at Abbey House, there appears to be an obvious 
level of respect and trust between staff teams. However, because of the layout of 
Barley Hall and the positioning of front of house members, there is limited contact 
between staff and disabled visitors. In their post-pandemic layout, which I discuss in 

322 
 
Chapter 7, visitors encounter staff members at the beginning and end of their visit. 
Throughout the museum, visitors are left on their own, meaning any barriers they 
encounter are never witnessed by staff members. In turn, Barley Hall relies on self-
reporting of difficulties from disabled visitors to expose any barriers to accessibility – 
indeed, they even mention on their website that staff “will be happy to… note any 
suggestions you have” (The JORVIK Group 2021b). However, as discussed in 
Chapter 8, many of my participants do not wish to disclose their accessibility needs. 
Their desire for nondisclosure leads to the necessity of passive accessibility 
measures, which must be embedded into the design of an exhibition to allow for a 
more inclusive experience. If Barley Hall staff are not available throughout the 
museum, they cannot observe any difficulties that visitors may have. The positioning 
of Abbey House staff members throughout the museum was integral to their 
observations which led to accessibility measures like the relaxed Father Christmas 
sessions. There is no potential for such observations at Barley Hall, and indeed, the 
only accessibility-related suggestion that front of house staff members could offer is 
regarding subtitles on the video that plays beside the admissions area. 
  
In this way, I believe the area most in need of attention at Barley Hall is the limited 
communication between visitors and staff members. There is potential for volunteers 
to fill this critical role, as they are normally stationed within the museum itself (see 
Chapter 9) and therefore can observe visitors interacting with the museum itself and 
any barriers therein. I was unable to interview any Barley Hall volunteers, discussed 
in Chapter 6, so I am unsure of how they sit within the team structure. Based on my 
own experience of volunteers within the wider JORVIK Group, they are similar to 
Treasurer’s House volunteers in that they are isolated from other teams. If Barley 
Hall volunteers are thus separated from other teams, a similar problem to 
Treasurer’s House may arise: the lack of communication between teams means that 
there is no discussion of barriers and potential solutions, rendering the 
communication between volunteers and disabled visitors less than impactful. 
 
I would also strongly encourage the JORVIK Group to rethink their desire to revert 
back to the pre-pandemic layout. At the time of handing in this thesis, the layout had 
not reverted, but since the lifting of restrictions in early 2022, there has been talk 
amongst senior management about changing the layout. I cannot ascertain any 

323 
 
reason for this aside from the original layout being more familiar. I would therefore 
recommend that they conduct visitor research to better understand the impact of the 
layout on visitor experience - my own data suggests that keeping the layout in its 
current form would be beneficial to all visitors, disabled and nondisabled alike. 
11.1.3. Reflections on Treasurer’s House. 
Turning to Treasurer’s House, I believe lack of communication is a significant barrier 
to any changes related to accessibility at this site. This lack of communication is 
present in all types of relationships that I examined in Chapter 9, and I vividly 
remember my own sense of frustration during my observations at how little staff 
teams interacted with each other. My interviews, discussed in Chapter 9, reveal a 
property full of people who wish to give all visitors, disabled and nondisabled alike, 
the best experience possible. However, with little interaction between the staff 
members themselves, there is great inconsistency in how this visitor experience is 
delivered. The inconsistency cannot be solved through training alone, although I do 
recommend a more holistic training agenda that encompasses hidden disability 
awareness. There must be a culture change within the property, where there is more 
contact and communication between teams, engendering the trust that was so 
evident at Abbey House and Barley Hall. Only by empowering staff members further 
down the staff structure can meaningful, inclusive change happen. 
 
I was fortunate enough to speak again with Dr Heather Smith, Equity Officer for the 
National Trust, about some of these concerns in February 2023. While she was 
unable to speak to specific issues at Treasurer’s House because she is a national 
officer rather than a local one, she did provide great insight into what the National 
Trust is doing to address the institutional barriers that many disabled people 
encounter. With the advent of their “For everyone, forever” campaign, there has 
been a great amount of effort put towards realising this goal, including increasing 
accessibility at their properties. Their EDI strategy, which I discuss in Chapter 4, 
mentions accessibility in many of their targeted actions. Additionally, they have 
developed the “Everyone Welcome” strategy to encompass all the work that they will 
do across the Trust. In explaining this new strategy, Heather made it clear that 
accessibility was built into every aspect and every action. This included updated e-
learning for staff and volunteers that included disability awareness, improved 

324 
 
sensory tours, bringing in external experts (both disabled people themselves and 
accessibility consultants), and several new pilot projects to test out technologies to 
increase the accessibility of their properties. Accessibility is being built into all 
projects from the very beginning, embedding passive accessibility into the visitor 
experience, something that I recommend in Chapter 8. They are also taking steps to 
address gaps in their disability awareness, which I discuss in Chapter 10, through 
their e-learning scheme and partnering with external experts.  
 
Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, funding has been set aside specifically to 
help properties make accessibility improvements. Indeed, new “accessibility 
standards” are being introduced across the Trust at Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels, 
and each property must agree to make improvements according to these levels. 
Bronze improvements are small, mostly inexpensive improvements, such as 
ensuring that induction loops are installed at all communication points. Silver 
improvements are slightly more expensive and more labour intensive, such as 
regularly scheduled BSL tours at a property instead of providing them on-demand. 
Gold improvements take considerable investment, such as the installation of a 
Changing Places toilet. The funding stream then is an extremely important aspect of 
this commitment to improving accessibility so that each property can analyse what 
would best suit their location and receive support to enact those changes.  
 
It is clear to me that there is a cultural shift taking place within the National Trust, one 
that embeds accessibility and disability awareness throughout all aspects of their 
operation and will therefore better benefit visitors to National Trust properties. There 
is also ongoing work to improve communication across staff hierarchies and to 
empower more junior staff to suggest improvements, something I discuss in Chapter 
9. The new “accessibility standards” scheme in particular gives each property a 
chance to find solutions that work best for them, as accessibility is never a “one size 
fits all” - neither for the sites nor for disabled people themselves. Additionally, 
because Heather was a member of my Thesis Advisory Panel, she has been 
involved with my research from the very beginning and had this to say about how my 
research has informed the National Trust EDI strategy:  
The heritage sector as a whole has much more to do to understand how to provide 
the best welcome to people with a broad range of disabilities and needs. This thesis 

325 
 
topic confronts this issue, led by testimonies from people with lived experience and 
evidence from their own visitor experience. This is by far the best way to learn and to 
understand what our environments are like and how we can improve. For our own 
part, this thesis arrives at a time where we are ripe to make these improvements. I 
have been, and will continue, to share the overarching learning across our places as 
a catalyst for our own commitment to Everyone Welcome for people with invisible 
disabilities, for whom we create very visible barriers both physically and emotionally. 
(Smith 2023) 
11.2. Limitations of this Research. 
Naturally, there are significant limitations to this research. Any project, particularly a 
doctoral research project, can only represent a small section of a larger picture. 
Below, I reflect on these limitations and also their impact on the final conclusions of 
this research.  
11.2.1. Disabilities Represented. 
Given the nature of this research, only a limited number of people could participate 
and even then, for a limited period of time. As discussed in Chapter 5, disabilities - 
and hidden disabilities in particular - can vary from day to day. Whilst I tried to 
account for this amongst my participants by having them explain the impacts of their 
conditions rather than relying on my own observations, they still represent only their 
experiences. Many of them also acknowledged that they would experience worse 
symptoms and deteriorating health as they aged (see Chapter 6), further implying 
that even amongst my participants, I was unable to capture the full range of 
symptoms and barriers that my participants would experience. 
 
Additionally, there is a limited number of hidden disabilities included in this research. 
As discussed in Chapter 1, “hidden disabilities” cover an enormous range of 
conditions. One research project would never be able to account for all of these 
conditions, hence the propensity of most surveys to focus solely on only one or two 
conditions. I wanted my research to strike a balance between a wide variety of 
hidden disabilities and a deep analysis of their implications in museum and heritage 
accessibility, hence why I selected a small number of participants and developed a 
methodology to more thoroughly examine their experiences.  

326 
 
 
As I discuss in Chapter 5, I utilised social media and an email campaign through the 
University of York to recruit participants. As a result, the overwhelming majority of my 
participants are women who are under 40. Whilst I do not believe that this has 
skewed results at all, I would be interested to hear from people with hidden 
disabilities who do not fit this particular demographic. I would also have preferred a 
wider variety of hidden disabilities. Again, I do not believe my results have been 
skewed as my findings reflect systemic issues not specific to any particular disability, 
but I would be interested to include more varied experiences. 
 
The initial design of this research included a linking online survey to gather additional 
data regarding accessibility at museums and heritage sites. The plan had been to 
distribute this as widely as possible to capture the voices of as many people with 
hidden disabilities as possible and link these wider trends to the deeper analysis of 
my participants. However, I decided against this method for several reasons. Most 
importantly, I felt that such a survey depersonalised these experiences. The point of 
my research was to elevate the experiences of disabled people, and an anonymous 
online survey necessarily detached their experiences from their identity. Indeed, a 
common drawback of online surveys is the conflation of privacy and anonymity, 
meaning that a right to privacy is seen as requiring complete anonymity (Evans and 
Marthur 2018; Siva et al. 2019; Andrade 2020). As discussed in Chapter 5, my 
participants took their identity as people with hidden disabilities very seriously and 
did not want that identity taken away. 
 
Additionally, the survey would have asked disabled people to reveal potentially 
triggering memories without any support or care given to their wellbeing. Buchanan 
and Hvizdak (2009) and Shaw et al. (2020) both emphasise the responsibility of the 
researcher to ensure vulnerable participants - and recall from Chapter 5 that my 
participants are considered ‘vulnerable’ due to their disabilities - are not further 
harmed, physically or emotionally, by taking part in research. As Liamputtong puts, 
“researchers delve into the private worlds of the participants and it is likely that their 
private worlds will be invaded” (39). I took my duty of care with my participants very 
seriously, ensuring that they felt safe and comfortable at all times during my 
research. There was no way to provide that same level of care to potential online 

327 
 
participants. I perceived it as harmful to ask disabled people to provide their negative 
experiences without also providing a space for them to work through these 
experiences and any emotions they stirred. As I felt a personal obligation to ensure 
my research did not exploit disabled people’s experiences, I could not in good 
conscience continue with an online survey that did not allow me to develop a trusting 
relationship with these participants. 
 
During the course of designing my methodology, I also came to the conclusion that 
qualitative data would be far more effective than quantitative for my research. As 
Warren puts it, qualitative research “is more concerned with being attuned to who is 
being travelled with, so to speak, than with setting out a precise route for all to follow, 
as in survey research” (2002, 86). Every disabled person has a different experience 
with disability, and because I wanted to focus on personal experiences, quantitative 
data did not fit into my overall research goal. As discussed in Chapter 5, qualitative 
research would allow me to examine these barriers with a more nuanced 
understanding while also allowing me to further query responses and incidents as I 
worked through the data. Rather than a wide but shallow analysis, I took a narrow 
but deep approach to uncover the themes discussed in Chapters 8-10.  
 
Above all, accessibility was a deciding factor in determining that an online survey 
would not provide enough relevant data to be academically meaningful. Studies have 
shown that disabled people are more financially disadvantaged (Koning and van 
Sonsbeek 2017; Emerson et al. 2021), and this includes access to the internet 
(Pilling, Barrett and Floyd 2004; Blank 2013). Additionally, many of my participants 
use some kind of screen reader or assistive technology - online survey websites are 
not necessarily created with these technologies in mind, again excluding potential 
participants. An online survey would inherently exclude a number of people with 
hidden disabilities due to these financial and technological reasons alone. Research 
has also shown that although the internet was originally seen as a way to break 
down barriers, it has only reinforced a great many of them, including the exclusion of 
disabled people (Watling 2011; Scholz, Yalcin, and Priestly 2017; Tsatsou 2021; 
2022). Social media, one method for recruiting participants to my research, is by no 
means perfect: many of these platforms treat accessibility as an afterthought or 

328 
 
additional user burden (Kent 2014; McMillen and Alter 2017) - and therefore I wanted 
to limit its use as much as possible.  
 
In the end, a linking online survey presented enough barriers to participation that I 
felt it would detract from the overall research project. There certainly would have 
been benefits to a survey of this kind, especially in gaining a wider perspective and 
potentially including more hidden disabilities, but the survey would also be better 
suited to a different research project.  
11.2.3. Organisational Understanding. 
There are, of course, numerous limitations to this research in terms of organisational 
understanding. I only examined barriers at three case study sites and although I 
chose three sites with three different types of heritage organisations (see Chapter 5), 
they do not represent the entirety of the museum and heritage industry. How would 
communication (or the lack thereof) manifest at a heritage site staffed fully by 
volunteers? What passive accessibility measures could be enacted at an open-air 
museum? What barriers would be present in a more traditional white box museum 
space? 
  
Additionally, I chose my case study organisations knowing there was a certain level 
of commitment to accessibility already. However, not all heritage organisations 
recognise the importance of accessibility and inclusivity – what systemic barriers are 
present in such places? How does one even begin to implement accessibility 
measures at a site that is more openly hostile to these changes? Features such as 
maps and personal interpretation boards can be framed as useful tools without 
highlighting their benefit to accessibility, but should they? 
 
Even within my case study sites, there are limitations to my conclusions, which I will 
discuss further now.  
11.2.3.1. Site Visits. 
I also acknowledge that I have limited evidence from my participants at two of my 
case study sites. Again, I discuss this more extensively in Chapter 7, but the advent 
of the COVID-19 pandemic meant that, although I had completed the site visits with 

329 
 
my participants to Treasurer’s House, I had very limited opportunities to take my 
participants to Abbey House and Barley Hall. As above, I do not believe that my 
ultimate findings would have altered, but I would have preferred a more balanced 
picture of all three case study sites. I would also have liked to incorporate more 
evidence from Abbey House and Barley Hall in my analysis, showing barriers such 
as low lighting (see Chapter 8) to be universal rather than a problem specific to 
Treasurer’s House. Whilst I did begin to observe similarities at Abbey House and 
Barley Hall, particularly in relation to matters of communal reading (Chapter 8), I 
would have preferred to find stronger parallels.  
11.2.3.2. Site Observations and Staff Interviews. 
My understanding of organisational barriers is not as strong as I would have 
preferred. Although I do not doubt that lack of communication across an organisation 
is the most significant barrier to implementing accessibility measures, I was only able 
to observe for myself this difficulty at one case study site. Based on the observations 
I was able to conduct, as well as the interviews with staff members, I believe that 
Abbey House and Barley Hall do not have the same challenges as Treasurer’s 
House, but I would have preferred more time to fully understand how their teams 
interacted. Additionally, I would have liked to interview a larger sample of staff 
members and volunteers at each case study site, but the challenges of COVID-19 
made this impossible. Again, I do not believe my ultimate findings would have 
changed drastically, but I believe that I would have significantly more evidence to 
support my themes, particularly lack of communication, as explored in Chapter 9. 
11.2.3.3. Documentary Analysis. 
In Chapter 5, I explain my use of Critical Discourse Analysis to understand the 
subtler power dynamics at work. Although I did apply this theoretical structure to all 
interactions I observed and participated in, I am curious what CDA as applied to the 
documents and policies of my case study organisations would reveal, particularly in 
light of NT’s motto change from “forever, for every one” to “for every one, forever.” 
The linguistic change seems to create more inclusion, and my initial reading of the 
brand strategy supports this idea, but a more thorough analysis is required to 
understand the depth of cultural change that such a document can produce. 

330 
 
11.3. Links to Wider Research. 
In many ways, my research conclusions mirror the conclusions of recent EDI work, 
as discussed in Chapter 4. Shifting from active to passive accessibility and 
embedding passive accessibility (Chapter 7) into practice parallels some of the EDI 
work done to identify and remove barriers to participation for people with other 
protected characteristics. In order for EDI strategies to succeed, the entire 
organisation must be encouraged at all levels of responsibility - something that can 
only be accomplished through open communication (see Chapter 8). Finally, it is not 
enough to be inclusive, organisations must actively work to be anti-discriminatory 
and dismantle institutional ideas that unconsciously exclude people. Similarly, it is 
not enough for organisations to acknowledge that they have inaccessible areas: they 
must work to identify the gaps in their disability awareness and then to educate 
themselves and their staff to address these gaps (Chapter 9). They must actively 
become anti-ableist, not merely “accessible.” 
 
Looking at more specific themes within the EDI landscape, my research specifically 
highlights other research going on in the area of the impact of hidden disabilities and 
of inclusive cultural participation. 
11.3.1. Impact of Hidden Disabilities. 
As mentioned above, because of the nature of this project, I was not able to examine 
the long-term effects of hidden disabilities on my participants. However, I did not 
think this examination would be particularly relevant, as there is already much 
research on the physical effects of hidden disabilities, both short-term and long-term. 
Multiple authors have already examined the physical impacts of arthritis (van 
Vollenhoven et al. 2019), depression (Hildrum et al. 2008), and hypermobility and 
EDS (Simmonds and Keer 2007), among other hidden disabilities. Much of this 
research focuses on the negative effects that these conditions create for those who 
are diagnosed, but I was more interested in the barriers that individuals face and 
how to remove these barriers. The differences in my research compared to much of 
this other research is rooted in the disability model employed: much of the impact 
research utilises the medical model of disability, positioning the problem within the 
disabled person, whereas my use of the human rights model positions society as the 

331 
 
disabling factor. There is a trend within the past few years to shift to a social model 
or a human rights model, particularly in the social sciences (Lawson and Beckett 
2020; Waddington and Priestley 2021), but most research situated within health 
sciences medicalises hidden disabilities. As I discuss in Chapter 1, this is not 
inherently problematic: research into more effective treatment of these conditions, 
especially physical conditions like arthritis or EDS, is invaluable for increasing quality 
of life in people with these hidden disabilities. However, this medicalisation does not 
remove societal barriers, nor does it promote social inclusion.  
 
Recall that the CRPD lays out in Article 30 that disabled people have the right “to 
take part on an equal basis with others in cultural life” (United Nations 2006, 22). The 
importance of my research is in examining how to dismantle these barriers and 
advance this right. As I discussed in Chapters 1 and 6, all of my participants 
experience real medical implications from their disabilities that I do not wish to belittle 
or dismiss. Therefore, I view my research as complementary to this more 
medicalised research, allowing a more holistic, whole-life approach to increasing 
quality of life for people with hidden disabilities.  
11.3.2. Inclusive Cultural Participation. 
There is also a large body of research examining inclusion in the wider cultural 
sector, including outdoor activities and sports. I reference Burns et al.’s research into 
barriers to participation in outdoor leisure activities in Chapter 3, but there are many 
more studies that examine inclusive engagement. For example, Ryuh et al. found 
that inclusive football - where children with and without intellectual disabilities (which 
they abbreviate to ID) played cooperatively on a team - showed “that [a] physical 
activity program which integrates children with and without ID can reduce the 
withdrawn behaviour and social distance of both typically developing children as well 
as children with ID” (2019, 701). In other words, these inclusive sports teams 
showed a positive wellbeing impact on both disabled and nondisabled children, as 
well as better attitudes towards disabled children on the part of nondisabled children 
(701). This agrees with Daruwalla and Darcy’s research that showed more 
interaction with disabled people contributes to positive attitudes and reduced 
negative stereotypes of disabled people (2005), something I discuss in Chapter 3. 

332 
 
Critically, however, the relevance of these studies to heritage spaces is worth 
questioning, as rarely are heritage experiences repetitive, competitive activities.  
 
Additionally, heritage spaces have been recognised as unique because of their 
connection to the past and what this connection means for people in the present. 
There is much research examining the benefits of interacting with heritage (Fujiwara, 
Cornwall, and Dolan; Sofaer et al. 2021; Power and Smyth 2016), and more 
research is being conducted aimed primarily at minority populations, including 
disabled people. Thomson and Chatterjee’s work in particular examines the 
wellbeing benefits of object-handling in clinical settings (Thomson et al. 2012; Camic 
and Chatterjee 2013; Thomson and Chatterjee 2016), generally hospitals or care 
homes. Her research showed that participants experienced “improved wellbeing after 
the intervention, such as improved mood, calmed anxiety, or a feeling of enhanced 
confidence” (2013, 234). More recently, Sofaer and Gallou examined the role of 
visits to heritage sites on wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, finding 
that “access to heritage sites reinstated a sense of normality and control over their 
actions” (2022, 29), something they sorely lacked due to lockdown restrictions. 
Again, I view my research as complementary to these previous investigations, as my 
research uncovers the barriers that keep people with hidden disabilities from 
participating in heritage, thereby preventing them from reaping the benefits of 
heritage that the other research highlights.  
 
Despite the limitations of my research, I do believe that the thematic results from my 
research are relevant to a large cross-section of people with hidden disabilities and 
dismantling barriers to their participation in heritage and wider cultural activities. As I 
discuss in Chapter 8, nondisabled people too benefit from passive accessibility. 
Better communication will bolster EDI efforts, discussed in Chapters 4 and 9. 
Uncovering gaps in disability awareness, which I discuss in Chapter 10, also 
exposes unconscious biases and presents interesting opportunities to adapt and 
redesign experiences that are more inclusive.  
 
Because my conclusions are more thematic, they present a higher-level view of the 
barriers present. Recall McKercher and Darcy’s (2018) “Hierarchy of barriers to 
travel by people with disabilities” diagram from Chapter 3 - there are tiers of barriers, 

333 
 
with Tier 1 barriers being common to all people, disabled and nondisabled alike. The 
barriers I have uncovered in my research are largely in Tier 1, with “gaps in disability 
awareness” falling into Tier 2. Had I included more types of hidden disabilities or a 
linking survey, perhaps more barriers would have come forward, and other examples 
of passive accessibility would perhaps be highlighted, but the overall landscape 
would not have changed. 
11.4. Next Steps. 
In creating my methodology, I always intended for it to be adapted and re-used in 
future research. I welcome other researchers to elaborate on my approach, 
incorporating more types of disabilities to increase our understanding of accessibility 
for people with hidden disabilities. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, I 
encourage more organisations to examine their own institutional roadblocks and 
query how best they can dismantle these barriers.  
 
Personally, I intend to continue exploring the barriers to accessibility within heritage 
sites. As I discuss in Chapter 6, I am an employee at YAT and although I have 
moved away from my front of house role, I am still heavily involved in accessibility 
not only at our attractions, but across the wider Trust as I work to develop our EDI 
policy. Because of my background, there will be an emphasis on accessibility and 
inclusion of disabled people, building on the work I have already done within the 
Trust. However, there is an impetus within the Trust to widen our inclusiveness 
beyond disability inclusion, and I am leading the development of Diversity 
Champions within the Trust. These Champions will be advocates for 
underrepresented groups by helping to shape policies and suggesting initiatives for 
the Trust to become involved in.  
 
Additionally, my links with my case study organisations have already proven fruitful, 
as I am in early discussions with both Leeds Museums and Galleries and National 
Trust to share knowledge and experiences that will benefit all organisations in 
becoming more inclusive. I have also connected with York Museums Trust, the other 
major heritage player in York, to similarly compare experiences and learn from each 
other, solidifying York - or at least its museums - as an inclusive place that welcomes 

334 
 
all visitors. I believe that strengthening connections between organisations in the 
sector like this will bring not only more ideas and insights to EDI, but also will spread 
inspiration and best practices more widely.  
 
Most importantly, I have remained in contact with several participants – indeed, two 
of them are now my co-workers at YAT. They continue to challenge me in my 
assumptions regarding the accessibility of our attractions and our workplace 
routines, as well as what it means to be disabled. 
 
Above all, however, I wish to remind those who are only beginning their journey into 
museum accessibility to not be overwhelmed. Changes cannot be made overnight, 
and small steps are better than none at all. As Ellie (Treasurer’s House; anxiety, 
chronic vestibular migraines, depression, fibromyalgia – Appendix C 5.4) says: 
It’s just little things that can make such a huge difference. And even for nondisabled 
people, visitors who don't have disabilities, I'm sure things like the lighting and 
making sure that fonts are legible are just as important [to their experience].

Appendix A – Participant 
Interview Design. 
This appendix contains the questions that I asked participants.  
1.  Pre-visit Interview. 
1.1. Introduction & consent forms. 
After arranging our meetings, this is the first time I come to their home. I re-introduce myself 
and my research, making sure that they understand what we’ll be doing and how I will be 
collecting data. Then I give them the opportunity to ask any questions before they sign the 
consent form, as well as take some general biographical information. This part is audio 
recorded. 
 
Hello, I’m Ashley, we’ve emailed a few times. Before we get started, I want to go over a few 
things just to make sure we’re all on the same page. My research is looking at accessibility 
for people with hidden disabilities in museums and heritage sites, and you’ve been asked to 
be a participant because you have a hidden disability. As I mentioned, we’ll have three 
different meetings: one now, so I can learn how you prepare for a trip, another one where we 
go to a museum – in your case, the ___________________ – and I’ll have a basic outline 
for things we’ll do, but by and large, I want you to lead that visit so I can understand how 
your hidden disability might affect your experience. After the museum visit, we’ll go straight 
to a café or a park and have a chat about the experience as a whole. Then, a few days later, 
we’ll have our last meeting where we’ll talk about the museum visit we took together again, 
but also about other museums you’ve visited and how they compare. Does that sound 
alright? 
 
I sent you a copy of the information sheet and the consent form, but I have copies right here 
for you to look over again. Before you sign the consent form, do you have any questions? 
 
Fantastic, I have a few questions for you – and I want to emphasise, you are free to not 
answer these questions if you don’t want to. You mentioned that you have ____________. 
I’ve done a little research on them, but you’re the expert, can you explain to me what they 
are? These are both conditions that you were born with, is that correct? Great – I’m asking 
because I can read any number of papers and books about it, but you have the lived 
experience, you understand what it’s like to live with these conditions much better than I ever 
will, and I’m really interested in your take on how it impacts you and your activities.  
1.2. Think Aloud practice. 
The Think Aloud technique has been shown to be a method that elicits mental processes to 
an observer in order to allow analysis of actions. It has also been proven that, with a bit of 
instruction and practice, the technique is even more effective. Ideally, it involves some kind 
of problem-solving activity, and I have them sort a collection of cards with photos of food on 
them, practicing the Think Aloud technique as they do it. This part is not audio recorded 
(but may end up being recorded simply for ease). 

336 
 
 
For the most part, I’m just going to observe you going through the motions of preparing for a 
trip to the museum. I might ask some questions along the way, but the main thing I want you 
to do is something called the Think Aloud technique. Basically, you’re going to narrate what 
you are doing and what you are thinking as you do something.  
 
So, to practice this, I have a little activity for you. I want you to practice thinking aloud while 
you sort these cards into groups. It doesn’t matter what the groups are, there’s no right or 
wrong answer here, I just want you to practice thinking aloud while you sort the cards. Does 
that make sense? 
 
After a demonstration of sorting things (not using the cards but simply whatever is at 
hand),  I have them then sort the cards into group, repeating the exercise until I feel satisfied 
they have had enough practice with thinking aloud. 
1.3. Trip preparation. 
This is the primary section of data that I am gathering. This may be “staged” in that the 
participant may have already done their website research or they may not be ready to 
prepare for the journey to the museum, but I still want them to simulate the actions so I can 
observe it. This part is audio recorded and written field notes taken during the interaction. 
1.4. Website research. 
There is not a set script for this section, but I observe how they plan and research a trip to 
the museum, including transportation arrangements. The participants use the Think Aloud 
technique they just practiced, with encouragement and prompting from myself if needed. 
Questions I am specifically looking to answer are: 
• 
What information do they need? 
• 
What websites do they check? 
• 
What access tools do they use? 
1.5. Physical preparations & considerations. 
Again, this section does not have a set script but instead I observe how they prepare for a 
trip. This part can vary widely from person to person, depending on their disability and the 
severity of it. This also could be the most personally invasive, as it may involve medication or 
medical equipment, so care and discretion is used to determine what is and is not necessary 
in terms of data. Questions I am specifically looking to answer are: 
• 
What specialist equipment or aids do they need? 
• 
What eventualities do they plan for? 
• 
How much time does it take to get everything together? 
1.6. Details for next time & wrap up. 
This section is far less formalised than any other section, but I am confirming our future 
plans, especially the date and time of our next meeting. I also make sure they have a way of 
contacting me (via email) if they need to change plans or have any further questions in the 
meantime. 

337 
 
2. Site Visit. 
2.1. Journey to site. 
I meet them at their home once again to travel to the museum with them, as I want to see 
what barriers and hurdles they encounter simply getting to a site. It may not be something 
that museums can directly control, but it may inform what information they can provide. 
There is no formal narration for this section and it is not audio recorded, though written 
fields notes are made. However, I am watching specifically for these things in each 
situation: 
• 
Via train. 
o 
Is there a problem with seating? 
o 
How is the staff interaction? 
o 
How well are things sign posted? 
o 
Is it easy to get from point A to point B? 
• 
Via bus. 
o 
Is there a problem with seating? 
o 
How is the staff interaction? 
o 
How well are things sign posted? 
o 
Is it easy to get from point A to point B? 
• 
What information does the museum provide? 
 
I also go over the points that I want to make sure they experience during the visit (see below 
for specific points). 
2.2. Semi-structured site visit. 
This is the main data collection section of the entire study. Based on a “mystery shopper” 
format, the visit is semi-structured, in that there are specific points that we visit, but for the 
most part, the participant leads how the visit goes. Having specific points allows for better 
comparison between participants, leading to more robust data analysis. These specific 
points are: 
• 
Visiting a particular exhibition (Abbey House – Danger Zone; Barley Hall – Great 
Hall; Treasurer’s House – Blue Drawing Room). 
• 
Asking for help. 
• 
Purchasing a small item in the shop. 
• 
Toilets. 
 
The mystery shopper format is divided into six main areas (finding the museum, entry and 
payment, museum experience, shop experience, team observation, and toilets) and in each 
area, there are the specific questions I am looking to answer. 
 
This section is audio recorded and also has written field notes, as well as potential for 
digital photographs of relevant details. I also ask them at various points to engage in the 
Think Aloud technique that we practiced during our first meeting to understand how they are 
interacting with a display. 
3. Post-visit Interview. 
This takes place in a nearby café – somewhere that is removed from the site itself to give 
some physical distance between the participant and the site. In the case of the Abbey House 

338 
 
Museum, it is across the street at the Kirkstall Abbey gardens café. It is a semi-structured 
interview, so the conversation will not necessarily go from question to question, but I try to 
guide the topics to gather relevant data. It is audio recorded and may have written field 
notes. 
3.1. Visit audit. 
3.1.1. The museum. 
• 
Was it easy to find the museum from the street? 
• 
Was it easy to find the entrance? 
• 
Could you understand the layout of the museum? 
3.1.2. The shop. 
• 
How was the signage? 
• 
Was there enough space to move around the shop? 
• 
Could you navigate the shop? 
3.1.3. The toilets. 
• 
Could you find the toilets? 
• 
Was the toilet clean? 
• 
Was the toilet floor clean? 
3.1.4. The staff. 
• 
Was the team member able to offer appropriate help when asked? 
• 
Did you feel welcomed at the museum? 
3.1.5. The exhibits. 
• 
How were the displays? 
1. Could you read the fonts? 
2. Was the colour contrast okay? 
• 
How was the volume on the videos? 
• 
Could you understand the stories and tales the museum told? 
• 
How was the noise level? 
1. Were some places too loud? 
2. Were some places too quiet? 
• 
How was the lighting? 
1. Were some places too light? 
2. Were some places too dark? 
• 
Were there enough places to sit and/or rest? 
3.1.6. Specific exhibition: Victorian Street (Abbey House)/Great Hall (Barley Hall)/Sitting Room 
(Treasurer’s House). 
• 
How were the displays? 
1. Could you read the fonts? 
2. Was the colour contrast okay? 
• 
Could you understand the stories and tales the museum told? 
• 
How was the noise level? 
• 
How was the lighting? 

339 
 
• 
Were there enough places to sit and/or rest? 
3.2. General questions. 
1. What was your favourite thing about the museum (generally)? 
2. What was your least favourite thing about the museum (generally)? 
3. One good and one bad thing about the museum (related to disability). 
4. Did any barriers jump out at you? 
5. Were there any access tools that were helpful? 
• 
Could the museum provide anything to help? 
• 
Could the museum design into their exhibitions from the beginning (font, 
colour scheme, etc.) that might be more helpful to you? 
• 
Did you bring/use anything that you personally supplied? 
6. How did the staff make you feel? 
• 
Did you feel you were treated any differently than other visitors? 
• 
Do you think you would be treated differently if your disability was visible? 
7. Would you visit the museum again? Why or why not? 
8. If you could tell the museum one thing regarding the accessibility of their site, what 
would it be? 
 
At the end of the conversation, I prompt them to think about other museum visits and how 
this one compares for us to discuss next time. I also confirm the details of our next meeting 
and check again that they have my contact details if they have any questions or concerns in 
the meantime. 
3.3. Journey back from site. 
This part of the journey should, theoretically, be similar to the journey to the museum, so I 
use this time to make a few written notes if needed and to build on my rapport with the 
participants. I also ask them if they would consider a return visit there as we part ways, now 
that they have had some time to soberly reflect on their visit. This is not audio recorded 
and no written field notes unless something unusual or extreme happens. 
4. Follow-up Interview. 
This meeting takes place ideally at their home again, but has the possibility to be a phone 
call or done via Skype or Google Hangouts, as it does not require physical interaction or 
observation. 
4.1. Recap of visit. 
After a brief welcome and small-talk catch up, I begin with a brief review of our site visit. This 
is to re-engage our rapport and to refresh the memory of the visit in both our minds. I ask 
confirmation questions, clarification questions, and follow-up questions based on our café 
chat and any other observations that have occurred to me upon reviewing my field notes and 
audio recordings from the visit. This section is audio recorded but no written field notes 
are taken. 
 
• 
They each mentioned one thing they would like to tell the museum. 
• 
Their favourite aspect of the museum. 
• 
They wouldn’t return alone, but they may take someone there if they’d never visited 
before. 

340 
 
4.2. My questions. 
This, like the café chat, is a semi-structured interview. I guide the conversation towards 
these questions, but give the participants the opportunity to lead the conversation. This 
section is audio recorded but no written field notes are taken. Questions I am most 
interested in are:  
• 
How did you feel the next day? 
• 
Did this museum remind you of any other museum you’ve visited? In good ways or 
bad ways? 
• 
Do you think there are different expectations put on paying vs non-paying 
museums?  
• 
If we had taken this trip on a “bad day” (for their disability), would it have changed 
anything? How? 
• 
Do you consider yourself disabled? 
4.3. Their questions. 
This section allows the participant to raise any questions or concerns they have about the 
project, the visit, anything I can generally answer. Also, if there is anything else they would 
like to discuss, they are given the opportunity to bring it up This section is audio recorded 
but no written field notes are taken. 
 
 

341 
 
Appendix B – Ethics Consent 
Forms. 
This appendix contains the ethics consent form that all participants and staff members that I 
interviewed read and signed. 
 
Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Accessibility for Hidden 
Disabilities in Museums and Heritage Sites  
 
1. What is the study about? 
This study is about understanding the access needs of people with hidden disabilities in 
museums and heritage sites. To this end, the researcher wants to go through all stages of a 
museum visit alongside people with hidden disabilities in order to get their perspective. This 
initial pilot study is to trial the proposed methods of gathering data (i.e., through interviews 
and observations before, during, and after a visit to one of the case study sites) and to test 
the more practical aspects of the methods. It is being carried out by Ashley Fisher, a PhD 
student in the Archaeology Department at the University of York under the supervision of Dr 
Sara Perry. All practical aspects of the study will be carried out by Ashley. The case study 
sites are Barley Hall (York), Treasurer’s House (York), and Abbey House Museum (Leeds), 
and the organisations that run these sites have agreed to participate. 
 
2. How will the research be carried out? 
Research will be carried by the researcher (Ashley) in various forms: 
• 
Interviews. 
• 
Observations. 
• 
Site visits. 
 
Data will be collected in various forms as well: 
• 
Audio recordings.  
• 
Written observation notes. 
• 
Photographs. 
 
Please note: photographs of the participants will not include identifying features, such as 
faces, though it may include other features such as hands. Voice recordings may be 
transcribed for the purposes of analysis and data accessibility. 
 
All participation is voluntary, and participants are free to leave the study at any time. Where 
possible, contributions will be removed from the record if requested.  
 

342 
 
3. How will the research findings be used? 
The findings from this pilot study will be used primarily to inform the design of the full scale 
study, which will involve the same data gathering methods (observations, interviews, and 
site visits) but with a larger sample size. However, some of the information gathered from the 
pilot may also be used in presentations, articles, or discussion in the full thesis. If it is used, 
all privacy measures will be taken to ensure anonymity. 
 
4. How will my data be stored? 
All data will be stored in a password-protected google drive with restricted access and on an 
external, password protected hard drive that is then stored in a locked cabinet. This means 
that only the researcher will have access to your data, and possibly her supervisor as well in 
extraordinary circumstances. Transcripts of the data will be included in the final thesis, but 
these will be anonymised. The data will be stored for a minimum of ten years.  
 
Data collection will be done in compliance with article 8 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights 
of the European Union. In addition to the EU charter, the collection of data will be done in 
compliance with the data protection acts, legislation, and directives of the University of York. 
You have the right to access your data at any time by contacting Ashley. The University is 
committed to the principle of data protection by design and default and will collect the 
minimum amount of data necessary for the project. 
 
All efforts will be made to anonymise your data if you choose. You may be assigned a 
pseudonym by Ashley or appoint one to yourself – please see the consent page for more 
information. Due to the nature of the research and of disabilities themselves, it cannot be 
guaranteed that all data will remain completely anonymous, but every effort will be taken to 
keep your identity confidential. 
 
5. Will I see the results of my data? 
Yes! The final thesis will be published and deposited in an open-access repository. 
Additionally, if you would like copies of sections that pertain to your data, please tick the 
appropriate box on the consent form and they will be sent to you when the time comes.  
  
6. Further Information and Contacts. 
Taking part in this research gives you the opportunity to contribute to an original piece of 
research and to have your opinions and experiences heard. We hope that taking part will be 
an interesting and enjoyable experience for you. However, in the unlikely event that 
participating in this study causes you any form of emotional distress, please contact Ashley

1.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met Aaron at a café in York to conduct this interview on 28 November, 2019. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, so I'm Ashley, we've emailed a few times. And before we get started, I just wanted to 
go over a few things to make sure we're on the same page. My research is looking at 
accessibility for people with hidden disabilities in museums and heritage sites. And you've 
been asked to be a participant because you have a hidden disability. So as I mentioned, 
we'll have three different meetings one now, so I can learn how you prepare for a trip. One 
immediately after this where we go to the museum – in your case treasurer's house – I have 
a basic outline for things we'll do. But by and large, I want you to leave the visit, so I can 
understand how your disability might impact your visit, then after the museum visit will go to 
café or something and have a chat about the experience as a whole. And then a couple 
days from now, we'll meet up again and have a chat again about that museum and other 
museums. That make sense.  
 
Aaron   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Wonderful. So I've got a copy of the information sheet as well as the consent form. So if you 
want to have a look at that, and then sign. Yes, excellent. Thank you very much. So you 
have, As we discuss, OCD, Asperger’s, bipolar and insomnia, right. All right, I've done 
research on them. And I have OCD myself, but I want to hear how you define these 
conditions and how they interact on your daily life. 
 
Aaron   
Okay, I think the best way to define OCD is we often hear a lot of people say, oh, I've got 
OCD about the worst possible thing to anyone who actually has OCD you can say. So part 
of defining OCD is anxiety. So like Monica on Friends, she enjoys cleaning. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. So yeah, 
 
Aaron   
it's when you don't enjoy. So like, most my life, the OCD was just for manifestations. So 
usually, for most people OCD is a certain thing, but OCD usually hits around 12, 13. I had it 
when I was like 4. Dad who was a sergeant in the army so he didn't really understand it. so it 

345 
 
was like cleaning quarantine kind of stuff, which evolved to doing things in four, so there 
were four members of my family. So you get up four times in the morning and go back to 
sleep, which is impossible. To eat four meals et cetera. And then OCD is chronic, you know, 
it kind of goes into pure love, which is what killed Joey Ramone and how he was I think was 
the richest guy in the world at the time. Yeah, the richest guy in the world was killed by... but 
yeah. So like now it's intrusive thoughts. So it's kind of like the worst thing that you can 
imagine going through your mind. So the only kind of way to solve it is by not giving fuck. 
you like rather than swimming against the tide, just let it take you away. So, if you kind of... it 
is a horrible for the premise of your mind you imagine your Mum dying or something horrible 
if you kind of have some like magnetism to that thought it gets worse. So you have to kind of 
say maybe, Yeah, fuck it might happen might not and then the thought just dies away. So, 
the consequence can be kind of reckless behaviour. But, you know, it's better than constant 
rumination. Yeah. In terms of bipolar, so I have like rapid cycling. Okay, so sporadic entirely, 
so it's not the typical 12 weeks of depression, 12 weeks mania. It's could be half a day of 
madness, half a day of fine. and there's no routine or prediction. So that makes life kind of 
impossible. But you know 24 seven so far so yeah. And I guess both of those cause 
depression. My depression is a consequence not the chemical... brain chemistry.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
Aaron   
Some people just get depression. I think they cause depression and some of it is caused 
from PTSD So.. I think it is but I don't know. But like, I'm still high functioning. I read like five 
books this morning. I read a book five times, but it's one of my favourite books, I read it like... 
started at 4am, finished at like six? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah.  
 
Aaron   
I remember it was like the 19th time I read that book. When I was so when we came back 
from Cyprus, we had a staying tenant in one of my dad's- well, our house that we lived in 
before in Cyprus. Yeah, so I'm like an army brat. And we went to video my brother who 
happens to be a marine. He was not there. It was not like this day. I was, I went with my 
mom and dad, to video this piece of shit. Like he wouldn't leave our house, he ran out and 
hit my mom with a hammer and she was in a coma for four months. I wouldn't give a 
statement. I was doing nothing. Yeah. So I think like consciously every day, I don't think 
about it. Maybe I'm gonna make jokes like on Shark Week, we make jokes when we see a 
hammerhead shark to chase around with like a hammer. So like we use humour. I think 
subconsciously like, yeah, I guess I have it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I definitely got [understand] it. How do you think the bipolar and the OCD interact? Hard to 
get routines? 
 
Aaron   
Yeah. I think this is... the thing with OCD is it's... I used to have really bad social anxiety. I 
think it's because of the OCD. Because people notice when you know, like, when I was 
younger, they obviously notice the physical kind of tapping, they can now notice the mental. 
like that someone can see when you're ruminating You know, when you're in lecture 

346 
 
someone can see when your thoughts are just rolling over. And in essays I read so much 
poetry that I like to have an obsession with writing in like, iambic pentameter so like that's 
not how you write an archaeology essay. It might be nice to read you know, like, you know 
Lord Byron didn't study archaeology so it's usually like the technique I do is I write it like that, 
gonna help it and then I kind of meditate with this mantra in a cold shower and then just kind 
of edit and then remotely and I read it like 15 times, delete it all and then write out again. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay 
 
Aaron   
so this seems to work but it's taking a lot of effort. I've got a degree in classics already So, 
okay, yeah. So like, yeah. But it depends what it will be like so for example OCD. I've done a 
lot of research into biochemistry. So everyone, there was a study in 1962. I think most 
people who suffer from OCD every OCD has a lack of GABA. So there's a few GABA 
agonist medicines. benzodiazepines. So if I had a shot of whiskey, I can write an essay. 
Okay, so I'm not drunk. Yeah, it just kind of little. Yeah. So well that would do would allow 
me to have the same GABA that everyone else has. Yeah, no, yeah, yeah. So things that 
that help. Also cold showers increase GABA, exercises increases GABA, Meditation mantra. 
Yeah. I don't know how to deal with it. It's like kind of being born blind. I don't know any 
different. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Now what about the Asperger’s 
 
Aaron   
Yeah, so I'm like it's in my medical record, but certainly medical conditions that so many 
similarities and symptoms that it can be like misdiagnosed? Yeah, obviously with Asperger's, 
it's usually the kind of defining characteristic of someone having Asperger's is the inability to 
pick up nonverbal communication but I don't know it seems that when I'm on a high, I’m fine. 
Yeah, so I think there might be a misdiagnosis.  Okay. But like I'm not a huge fan of people 
really, in the hands of the people so like when I used to live in London for example, which 
was hell, I used to make sure that I went to like natural history museum on like a bank 
holiday, because ironic, on a bank holiday, you'd expect [lots of people] Yeah, but they 
weren't that they were all kind of doing things with their families. There were no tourists, and 
it was actually more empty on the bank holiday than it was at any other time of the year So I 
just used to go on bank holiday. I enjoy Halloween because I can wear a mask. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So going off the bank holiday thing, what do you do when you are preparing to go to a 
museum? What kind of what kind of things do you look at? Or do you just go? 
 
Aaron   
Um, so I guess like if it was like a particular museum that was so when I went to all the 
Smithsonian in DC, like they would be an insane not to go. Yeah, like even though his 
background, the English facet of the Lord do so better that he gave all of his wealth to an 
American developer to build one of the greatest museums in the world. So I think sometimes 
when the passion to go there is stronger than the anxiety, then you just say fuck it. And plus 
the Native American Museum, the Smithsonian Native American, they had great food. 
Before I went with my Dad and it was fun. So if my Dad with me or my lady friend in DC, 
then it's fine. on my own, not so much. Okay. So if I go alone, I usually I have plan before I 

347 
 
went or I kind of just instead of like most museums are done, you know chronologically and 
for the time like Native American especially. So if there are a lot of people, I couldn't follow 
the chronological order, I'd have to go backwards. Okay. So, yeah, but yeah, these 
museums are so great that my interest in this subject is overpowering. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
do you check out any other websites or anything like that before you go to a place?  
 
Aaron   
Yeah, yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
What sort of things Do you look at other websites? 
 
Aaron   
I just look for posterity. Yeah. Like there's not like there's not really like a mental disabled 
ramp? Yeah. They don't really say, you know, yeah, there's a metaphysical realm that you 
can take into this museum. So, yeah, there's no.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
So you wouldn't look at like, an accessibility guide or their access page.  
 
Aaron   
Oh, no, I guess I wouldn't, because I wouldn't expect that to be anything. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure. 
 
Aaron   
There may be something in some of the museums in DC about mental health access, but I 
don't think there is. Yeah, there is. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. Do you bring anything with you as like a comfort object or soothing thing or so 
 
Aaron   
yeah, so sounds kind of fun. Far out. So I read Lord of the Rings every autumn and 
Gandalf's advice. This was quite is the you know, smoking a pipe is like quite meditative. I 
stay with the Hare Krishna every year and they all smoke pipes, tobacco obviously, and the 
thing about Pipe is we don't take it back into your lungs. You might get mouth cancer, but 
you won't get lung cancer. But it takes around about an hour just to pack it perfectly. Like if 
it's not packed perfectly, it won't smoke perfectly. Yes. So you spend an hour just packing 
the pipe type of thing. and then you have to get a match like you can lay it with a zippo or 
you can light it but it's not really like anything else. And then you have to be conscious of not 
taking it back into your lungs. So the whole experience is very in the moment very present, 
so I bring a pipe with me everywhere. Okay, so like that Sometimes even if I'm not smoking 
it, I just have it in my mouth yet and he brings in like Kassala and yeah, I guess this is all 
 

348 
 
Ashley Fisher   
excellent. Um, do you prepare for any potential scenarios or anything that would happen on 
a trip?  
 
Aaron   
No, no. Like, there's the Doom is always impending. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So yeah. 
 
Aaron   
I've had one thing and something else pops up so much fun. I can't face all of my back or 
anything. So yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, and would you say it takes you an average amount of time to get ready?  
 
Aaron   
Actually, it is quite long. I'm usually kind of like when I wake up it's like glass, a glass 
touching every morning. It's not really it's not like a shock anymore. It's just, you know. So 
like, it takes me time to adjust to that, read meditations by Marcus Aurelius, used to read the 
whole book in the morning but I don't have enough time anymore. So yeah, usually just read 
one of the chapters of the book. Like I read Book Three today. They're very sporadic. Yes, 
what happens usually in the morning, and then I have like a 10 minute Cold Shower until I'm 
blue. Then I meditate like five or 10 minutes and then dress, go and have a cigarette, come 
back. Call my mom. And then I'll be ready. Okay, so I usually wake up about I don't sleep. 
So. Yeah. If I have like a lecture at say 10, I start preparing oh six. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It sounds like a lot of it is sort of mental preparation to get ready for different things. 
 
Aaron   
Mhm. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. So that's all the questions I have for right now. We'll head over to Treasurer's 
house from here. We're going to be doing what's called a semi structured visit, which 
basically means you are going to take the lead. There's going to be a few specific things that 
we make sure that we do. One is visiting a particular room for treasures house. It's the blue 
drawing room and I'll let you know when we get there. We'll also have you talk to a staff 
member for help or just listen to them, whatever you're comfortable with purchasing a small 
item from the shop I've got five pounds, knock yourself out there, and then visiting the toilets. 
So pretty simple, common, everyday things that most people do on a visit. And then after the 
visit will go to a café or something and have a little bit of a debrief. We'll go through a visit 
audit just to just kind of a checklist to see how do you think the museum did in certain areas 
and then also have a chat about the rest of the visit and make sense? Yeah, perfect. 
Excellent. All right. Let me 

349 
 
1.2. Site Visit. 
Our visit to Treasurer’s House took place on the same day. The audio was recorded, but 
there was nothing relevant to transcribe. 
1.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
After our site visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct this interview, still on the same 
day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How easy was it to find museum from the street? 
 
Aaron   
Well, you've got me so I still have an American SIM so I don't have GPS So yeah would 
upon that right So that's a bit of a record. I didn't know what the proposal was. I was just 
looking up so you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't have found that there was no I wasn't really 
looking out for him. So I didn't need to connect with it. So yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. Let's find the and was the layout of the museum You 
 
Aaron   
know, it was just it was just like, you know, some guy making up for lack of points in 
yesterday, so he was just an egomaniac I think. So everybody is here as such, like it was no, 
it wasn't like, you know, highly intelligent guy was no drastic, drastic. in chronological order. 
Yesterday was just this house. So the layout is just this How about the hospital 
 
Ashley Fisher   
for sporadic thinking about shop specifically was there enough space to move around shop 
 
Aaron   
Well, I guess if you don't want to buy anything on those things you're fine 
 
Ashley Fisher   
[would you have found the shop] 
 
Aaron   
I think I've seen this I think I would have found it Yeah. I just hate you always have to go 
through the shop quite a toilets. Capitalism twice when I was I guess it was easy to find 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were the toilets easy to find 
 
Aaron   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

350 
 
Were they clean 
 
Aaron   
but the use of this delusion to the automatic war comes up just never happens to exist doing 
and then some guy comes up to me and do the same thing and then laughing more comes 
up so and also the world since we're in have the same distance between polite people 
because we both know that you know they were free They're not they had total role in those 
college students 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thinking about the staff now. Was the staff member able to answer your question?  
 
Aaron   
Oh, yeah, I think I seen David speaking. Yeah. And they were warm, welcoming. You know, 
they weren't stand for that. But anyway, I took one. Sounds good. It's kind of like, you know 
that, you know, the Clifford smiled of that. Yeah. I went, that's my friend and girl who was 
working on that. I was asking her questions. I'll see the 19 Taurus came over. But I was 
being directed. So asked me for questions. It was just to say, Great job. Wasn't a challenge. 
She was a little more sun in the rain. Oh, that was I'd love to speak to people about this right 
it's cold and rain. So I think maybe we'll have the brother the guy was kind of funny as well. 
He was ...especially for an old guy he was strange the other way kind of appreciated that 
special for by Sir I think he was pretty supportive thing if you're going to be a more of that 
money so I liked him he was a woman. First one is new to so yeah, she knew that she didn't 
know, which means So like seven like why are so and really relevant to the museum three 
owners. So she gave 
 
Ashley Fisher   
me the best answer. 
 
Aaron   
Yeah. I'm just meticulous. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you feel welcome? 
 
Aaron   
Yeah, I think I did. Yeah. Like I went with you so it was different hello yeah, I think it was 
definitely like not recently here in London where people just walk around difficult darkness or 
other mainly in 40 facilitators anyone can get another so yeah, yeah whatever they like funny 
because if this was like 10 years ago out of my social gatherings so, I think depending on 
you know like kind of hygiene said stage uncle and now 
 
Ashley Fisher   
[noise levels] 
 
Aaron   
Pretty good I think the kind of guides for loud enough that you could hear without having to 
be an active participant in here. So you go return the living God people advertise every 

351 
 
made saying that the conversation ends this most announced like a person speaking for 
recorded voice share 
 
Ashley Fisher   
[do you prefer interacting with live people or listening to the recording] 
 
Aaron   
that Andrea luck with that and you know you don't have to react And you know you kind of 
get the feeling if there's a tour guide or whatever in there, you know how many times as he 
said the same thing, you know, he must say it, you know, he must have to put on a happy 
face, working on those jokes once again. So I think There's no pressure [with the recording] 
suppose it's just the voice is not like you know – as long as it's an actual voice and not 
a  voice generated by a computer 
 
Ashley Fisher   
how's the lighting 
 
Aaron   
but the room is didn't know it wasn't consistent. Some were really dark and some were really 
light, like some museums in DC I like- it's quite dark but when you get to love the actual 
exhibition or  the text, it's illuminated so you can read the text and the things – so they light 
up what matters, what doesn't matter is more Ambient 
 
Ashley Fisher   
so like spotlights you could read. places that were too light to dark just 
 
Aaron   
toilet was a bit light only have one beautiful life 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thinking about the blue drawing room specifically, how was the noise level in there  
 
Aaron   
Nothing that really bothered me 
 
Ashley Fisher   
and lighting 
 
Aaron   
nothing wrong with a string guy was 
 
Ashley Fisher   
enough places to sit or rest 
 
Aaron   
no 
 

352 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What's your What's your favourite thing about 
 
Aaron   
the tapestries 
 
Ashley Fisher   
least favourite thing 
 
Aaron   
trying to find it 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So what's one good thing related to accessibility 
 
Aaron   
I don't think … Sorry, but it wasn't busy they pretty much it was but it wasn't. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So less crowded. [something they can improve on] 
 
Aaron   
Below the show there was no history but there's no progress. So like you have to speak to 
someone if you want to know the history [???] So I want to speak to whoever asked about 
what enough You know, I think maybe if they had more information about the 
paintings  because they were  
 
Ashley Fisher   
you feel like you're treated any differently than any of the other? 
 
Aaron   
I think the staff for good is like sometimes we go to shop like a clothing shop, instantly get 
just tap on the cloud. They seem to pick up if you wanted, if you want help or not. Some 
guides, they didn't speak to you because they knew you didn't need...Same thing, others 
knew if you wanted appreciate yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If your disability had been visible, do you think you would have been treated differently 
 
Aaron   
Yeah. look in their eyes hair standing up on their arms people kinda taking steps back 
condescending, patronising 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Would you visit again? 
 

353 
 
Aaron   
If I had a friend I guess so the only know that I would like personally I didn't enjoy it, but I 
mean that wasn't the museums' fault, it's not about museum says no never go about that no 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If you could tell the museum one thing regarding the accessibility of their site, what would it 
be? 
 
Aaron   
I think there's more [talking about bipolar] rapid cycle so I Think sometimes  
they should have maybe days whether a person every single room to tell you about 
everything like maybe just have enough information in text on the walls, [basically, less 
pressure to interact socially to get information] 
1.4. Follow-up Interview. 
I was unable to conduct a follow-up interview with Aaron as he stopped answering my emails 
and I had no other means of contacting him. 
2. Alfie. 
Alfie is a man with dyslexia and monocular vision. 
2.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met Alfie at a café to conduct this interview on 21 January 2020. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
No, it's just if someone wants to go by a different name. Excellent. Thank you very much. 
Now that's going into cabinets in case anyone wants to see it. So, my name is Ashley, we've 
emailed a few times. Okay, so I have a few questions for you about your disability. You said 
that you had dyslexia and low vision or visual difficulties – can you tell me more about that? 
 
Alfie   
Sure. So I find that my dyslexia, it takes me a long time to read anything, so often I'm locked 
out to reading stuff – like the form, like, yeah, I could read it, but... but my main problem is 
like my sight. So I see out of one eye. Okay. So everything is 2D. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. 
 
Alfie   
So that means that getting around is quite fun. Sometimes crossing a road from the other 
side. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's going to be complicated. Yeah. 
 
Alfie   

354 
 
Yeah. At least exciting times. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I can imagine. And those are both conditions that you've been born. Is that correct? Yeah. 
Okay. So it's not like your vision has declined over time. It's just, this is what you're used to. 
 
Alfie   
So the vision has declined. Okay. It's been... I've only been able to see out of one eye as 
long as I can remember. Okay. Yeah. But yeah, the vision's still getting worse. So it's getting 
more exciting. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Very exciting. Was it more of a natural bad eyes, run in your family, and just That's how it is 
or is it something 
 
Alfie   
It's in my family, but I am the worst in the family and also they – the rest of them who've got 
binocular vision. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah because you've got monocular vision. All right. Now obviously that has an impact on 
reading Do you find it has a different impact on reading on printed material versus digital 
material? 
 
Alfie   
Not that much. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
 Okay. 
 
Alfie   
I guess I'm more used to readings on laptops nowadays. Okay, it doesn't strain my eyes to 
read it easier. Yeah. Online, I find that my eyes will skip lines. Whereas on paper. I'm very 
careful. It takes a lot longer. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay. Excellent. So let's talk about your preparation for going to museums. And what 
kind of research Do you do before you go to a place? 
 
Alfie   
So before I will go to a place I would often see what was there to see what facilities they had. 
Okay. See if they have a café.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
sure. 
 
Alfie   

355 
 
So try and work out if there's any particular exhibit. So just a general background, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
basic things like that. Yeah. Cost, hours. Where do you check to find that information? 
online?  
 
Alfie   
online. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Is it on their website? Is it on TripAdvisor? 
 
Alfie   
It's either on Google or on their website, okay. spending it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Have you looked at the barley Hall website at all? Totally fine if you haven't. 
 
Alfie   
I think I have. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay.  
 
Alfie   
Like a year ago. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Fair enough. 
 
Alfie   
Yeah. You're welcome for that honesty. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
This is what we like. Um, are there any particular accessibility tools that you use like a 
screen reader or a colour overlay or anything like that? Oh, excellent. 
 
Alfie   
Often I make the text bigger. So I magnify Okay, but not using that access tool, just zoom in. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
zoom in?  
 
Alfie   
Yeah. 
 

356 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. Um, do you bring anything with you when you go somewhere? 
 
Alfie   
As in like wallets and coat 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Anything. Okay? 
 
Alfie   
Often I would bring a friend Okay. And also my wallet and phone. Yeah, so if I don't have 
enough time to read all the information, I can take a photo of it. Okay. And then if I'm 
interested later I can read it. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And you normally take a friend is that just because you prefer going around a museum with 
someone else or Okay, yeah, yeah, 
 
Alfie   
They help motivate me to go to a museum and also depending on who I'm with, I can ask 
them a question about [things]. I can see from here, but I can't quite tell exactly what it is. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, sure. 
 
Alfie   
Well, I can ask them to just summarize a portion of it says in the text. Yeah. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So it's sort of like a, a, an unofficial companion kind of thing. Yeah.  
 
Alfie   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you plan for any emergencies or eventualities?  
 
Alfie   
Nope 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It sounds like there isn't necessarily any emergencies or situations that might spring up 
because of your disability. So 
 
Alfie   
if my glasses broke, I would just carry on walking and just hope for the best 

357 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah, I know that- I don't have quite as bad vision as you but I have negative 7.5 so 
like, it's pretty bad. Yeah. I super get that. 
 
Alfie   
You have similar vision to what I have. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, it's not quite fun. So for the visit itself will go in just a few minutes. We're calling it a 
semi structured visit. By and large you're leading it so it can last five minutes if you just want 
it to last five minutes can last for until they close if you want up to you. We'll go around, visit 
like you normally would. There's just a couple basic things that I'm going to make sure that 
we hit so visiting a particular exhibition, barley Hall, it's gonna be the parlour, which is 
upstairs asking a staff member for help, purchasing a small item from the shop by five 
pounds cash, so don't worry about that. And visiting. I know we're spending big on this one. 
Oh, and visiting the toilets. So very normal things that everybody does. I'm going to have a 
microphone on you for the visit if that's okay. Yeah. But it just helps me have specific points 
of comparison between all the participants, and then afterwards, we'll go maybe back here. If 
it's still open. I have no idea what the refectory does anymore. And just have a quick debrief 
and go through visit audit worksheet and does that sound okay? 
2.2. Site Visit. 
Our visit to Barley Hall took place on the same day. 
 
Alfie   
Hopefully you can hear me. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
We'll find out. Alright, can you stick that in your pocket... 
 
Unknown Speaker   
[note: video in steward's room is VERY loud and covering up a lot Ashley and Alfie's speech 
until they leave the area] 
 
Ashley Fisher   
[in the Great Hall] Can you read the sign. 
 
Alfie   
I just... like... can we pick them up? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes, yes, they are can be picked up the font that.... it's not dyslexia friendly I can tell you that 
right now. 
 
Alfie   
Are you dyslexic? 

358 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I'm not but I've done a looooot of research on dyslexia friendly fonts how is the colour 
contrast color 
 
Alfie   
It's actually okay 
 
Ashley Fisher   
some people find light text on a dark background hard Like place.. the brightness of the area 
will impact how readable something is. 
 
Alfie   
Yes [discussing text panels hanging on the wall] Better than the ones downstairs which are a 
lot smaller. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So these are newer ones. Yeah. Just barely a year while the others are over four or five 
years. Yes, magic and mystery. It's about mystical beliefs and how it sort of science for 
medieval people. Okay. It's like the magic and  science where the same.  especially 
medicine and things like that. So, 
 
Alfie   
yeah. Until people start being better. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
We don't talk about that.   
 
Alfie   
This herb helps in the fighting against weasels and dragons! For some reason this is actually 
quite easy to read. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Interesting. These are pretty much the same... text wise... 
 
Alfie   
Maybe it's the lighting then? Maybe it's the balance of less text. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I was wondering maybe had to do with the spacing around the text 
 
Alfie   
maybe As in from line to line and rest of it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

359 
 
Yeah. Yeah. Like this looks a lot more crowded with this. It looks a lot more spread out or 
wider  
 
Alfie   
[talking about how one particular sign is difficult to read] 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah, that has much more good background at the bottom. Yeah 
 
Alfie   
I could read the one that had the biggest text but I couldn't really read the others. [Alfie 
enjoys making a wand] Yeah, basically the same 
 
Ashley Fisher   
would more space in between. So it was closer to this spacing... 
 
Alfie   
Often when I'm reading this one, I'll often think of that line for so re-read second yes 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What do you think of the lighting in this room? [lesser chamber] 
 
Alfie   
It's very hard to read anything. I can stand here and keep reading it, but I'll enjoy things and 
the place less.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. So it's better use of your energy to go Okay, that's an astrolabe, that's a ______ and 
that's all you need to know. 
 
Alfie   
Yeah. It just means I know things are, really [but not much else] [went through and read what 
the different dream interpretations were on a board] 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Or like that first letter [in the fancy font], and then like a more.. easier to read font for the rest 
of it. 
 
Alfie   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
They can have their artistic thing, But then also people can read it 
 
Alfie   

360 
 
Yeah. And again, too much text It's harder to read in here [the study – because of the 
lighting]. In a dark room, there's also less contrast 
 
Ashley Fisher   
so it's not a big deal that it's quite this dark but can you see anything? So 
 
Alfie   
I can see what things are, I can't tell where they are. It doesn't matter so much, the detail.  
2.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
After our site visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct this interview, still on the same 
day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so we just came back from barley hall and we walked to the site, how well or poorly 
were things signposted to get there do you think? Did you notice any signs directing you 
there? 
 
Alfie   
I didn't. Okay. Until the alleyway. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so I think that's coffee yard. Yeah, okay 
 
Alfie   
yeah I didn't notice them. They may have been there 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I genuinely don't know so okay. excellent How easy was it to get there from King's manor to 
get to there? 
 
Alfie   
Quite easy 
 
Ashley Fisher   
quite easy okay yeah 
 
Alfie   
building work doesn't help but that's just a temporary issue 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah. it is York and it is construction season so 
 
Alfie   
yeah I didn't really know where the entrance was. when we're putting on the mic I just 
thought that was around the corner from the entrance 

361 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was it easy to find the museum from the street. silly question for Barley Hall but 
 
Alfie   
From the street with the building work [Stonegate]? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
Alfie   
Yeah was okay. I couldn't find the entrance but finding Barley Hall itself was not difficult 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Did you understand the layout of the museum? 
 
Alfie   
It was a bit of an odd layout, but I knew where to walk. Okay. I would have missed that one 
section [from the study to the other side]. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thinking about the shop. How is the signage in there 
 
Alfie   
As in for...? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
as in the shop or the ticket signs, okay. Great signs.  
 
Alfie   
Yeah, pretty small okay. Yeah. I decided just to ignore them and look at the items 
themselves. Okay. I think the item I got in the end didn't even have a label. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And was there enough space to move around the shop?  
 
Alfie   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
And could you navigate around the shop easily or?  
 
Alfie   
Yeah. I don't know how it would be if someone was less mobile, but for me it was fine.  
 

362 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Could you find the toilets?  
 
Alfie   
Yes.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was it clean?  
 
Alfie   
Yes,  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was the toilet floor clean. 
 
Alfie   
I think so. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
We're gonna go yes.  
 
Alfie   
I only looked down when I stepped in the little hole thing. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, so the staff was the team member able to, you know, answer your question to your 
satisfaction. 
 
Alfie   
It was a good answer. Not what I expected, which is always good. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Did you feel welcomed in the museum?  
 
Alfie   
Yeah, yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, thinking about the exhibits now, how were the displays just in general, 
 
Alfie   
They weren't bad – it was nice that they were interactive. You could get a better 
understanding of it. I'm someone who does things better by touch than reading. So 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Could you read the fonts? 

363 
 
 
Alfie   
Not everywhere, not everywhere. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And that was partly because of the font itself and the size and the lighting and spacing of just 
 
Alfie   
And the background and material. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah. How was the colour contrast? 
 
Alfie   
Some places were fine, some places were not. Like when it had a background it was difficult 
to read and then yeah, I'm also depending on the lighting in the room, if the lighting was 
dark. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. How was the volume on the videos 
 
Alfie   
in the main when you entered there are quite hard to hear because people where being 
quite noisy elsewhere. Oh, yeah. The one upstairs about dreams was fine. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Could you understand the stories and tales that the museum told 
 
Alfie   
I understood the part about the witches upstairs. Okay. I didn't really get that many 
narratives. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. That was the overall noise level of the place 
 
Alfie   
Fine. It had good noise cancelling. Considering the [building] work. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
We're any places too loud?  
 
Alfie   
No, no. Other than the street.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Were any places too quiet? 

364 
 
 
Alfie   
No. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Are you the type of person that says no place in the museum is too quiet or the type of 
person that says no places too loud in a museum? 
 
Alfie   
Doesn't really matter. Okay. I don't know. I think somewhere could get too noisy for me. I just 
wouldn't be able to see. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, sure. How was the overall lighting? 
 
Alfie   
Not bad. Okay. Well, in parts, it wasn't bad. Yeah. In parts it was really bad.  
 
Unknown Speaker   
All right. So what were some of the parts? Well, were there any parts that were too light or 
bright  
 
Alfie   
I found upstairs, there was one room [the parlour] where it was hard to read the label 
because the light was shining on it. Yeah, yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
But that was more because of the glare on the thing. 
 
Alfie   
Yeah, yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And were some places to dark.  
 
Alfie   
Yes. Yes.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. What kind of places? 
 
Alfie   
The food places. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, the pantry and the butlery.  

365 
 
 
Alfie   
That's the one. Upstairs that was the room we went off to first 
 
Ashley Fisher   
the lesser chamber or the greater chamber? 
 
Alfie   
The... lesser one? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
the dream one.  
 
Alfie   
Yeah. That was very dark. I think in the other rooms, they were light in parts and dark in 
parts. Yeah. But those rooms in particular...  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Those rooms were particularly bad Okay, were there enough places to sit and or rest? 
 
Alfie   
I don't know? I didn't look for any. I'm someone who would just sit on a  doorstep. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So having a nearby place it isn't necessarily a priority. Thinking about the parlour so the 
room that all smelly things and where you did the wand? Yeah. How were the displays in 
that room? 
 
Alfie   
They were better.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. What made them better?  
 
Alfie   
They were bigger, more space, better lighting in the room in general. Yeah. Material of the 
boards wasn't bad. They didn't have background graphics. And then next to the gemstones, 
that was quite small and immoveable one. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure. So having the movable boards really, really helps. 
 
Alfie   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

366 
 
And could you read the fonts in there in those ones?  
 
Alfie   
I could. They were better than the rest. Yeah. But it was the same font as everywhere else.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty sure they use the same font throughout but it feels different in certain 
places somehow. What about the colour contrast?  
 
Alfie   
Not bad 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Could you understand the stories and tales told in that room?  
 
Alfie   
Yeah,. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, cuz that was the witches 
 
Alfie   
Yeah, that was the one I did get. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How was the noise level in that area? 
 
Alfie   
Not bad.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
How was the lighting in that area?  
 
Alfie   
Good, good.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
And were there places enough places to sit and or rest there? 
 
Alfie   
Didn't notice.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. That's fine. Alright, so that is our visit audit.  
 

367 
 
Alfie   
Amazing 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Now I got a couple other questions if that's okay.  
 
Alfie   
Sure.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
What was your favourite thing about the museum in general? 
 
Alfie   
I thought it was interactive. Okay. Not many museums are. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What was your least favourite thing about the museum in general? 
 
Alfie   
Probably the boards.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Just how frustrating it was that you couldn't always read it? Okay, 
 
Alfie   
yes. How when I stood reading it how draining It was 
 
Ashley Fisher   
okay. What was one good thing related to accessibility or disability museum? 
 
Alfie   
That's a good question. Probably quite a few. 
 
Ashley Fisher 
You can say as many things as you like, but at least one would be nice. Yeah. 
 
Alfie   
The sound was relatively good, okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Like in terms of volume level or in terms of how it's not very echo in there. 
 
Alfie   
Both. 
 

368 
 
Ashley Fisher   
 Okay. 
 
Alfie   
Also I didn't see anything that would affect colour blindness. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, yep. 
 
Alfie   
Once again it was interactive, it was more involved.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah. certainly have more senses involved in it that way 
 
Alfie   
Yeah. So if you, if you can't use one you had other one which would help. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, so what's one bad thing about accessibility? 
 
Alfie   
The boards were hard to read. Also if you were less mobile, it would be very hard, and the 
steps leaning odd ways 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think they need to replace the steps or put a sign there or inform people  
 
Alfie   
I think informing might be good. Once you saw the 'beware step' in the way [it was easy to 
recognise them further on]. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Sure. Right. Um, did any barriers jumped out at you 
 
Alfie   
The steps. And that there's just many steps in general. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think the museum could provide anything that would be helpful for you to go 
around?  
 
Alfie   
For me personally? An audio thing. Then I wouldn't be so reliant trying to read everything. 
Yeah. 
 

369 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Could the museum design anything into their exhibitions from the very beginning that would 
help? Like the font choice, for example, 
 
Alfie   
the boards could be better. Yeah. And not just for the font but making sure it's a consistent 
size that is big enough to be read. Sure. On a material that doesn't reflect. Even in the rooms 
where there's low light, if you get the basics sorted out, it will be okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, okay. Yeah. How did the staff make you feel? 
 
Alfie   
They were friendly, so welcomed? I guess. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
There's not a lot of stuff interaction in that museum. Do you think that's a good thing or bad 
thing? Just the thing. Okay, 
 
Alfie   
Just a thing. sometimes it's useful, sometimes you just get stuck somewhere. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay. Do you think you would have been treated differently if your disability was 
visible?  
 
Alfie   
Don't think do. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Is that good or a bad thing? Or again, just a thing? 
 
Alfie   
Just a thing. Yeah. So there's good because they were just so friendly. I don't think they 
would have caused me hassle with more visible. but also 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, so that was a good base level friendliness that would cover just everybody.  
 
Alfie   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Would you visit the museum again?  
 
Alfie   

370 
 
Probably. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Why? 
 
Alfie   
It is an interesting place. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If you could tell the museum one thing regarding the accessibility of their site, what would it 
be? 
 
Alfie   
Make it [accessible]. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. What specifically would you have them change? 
 
Alfie   
For me it would be sorting out the basic font stuff. So is it big enough, visible enough.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Anything else that pretty much 
 
Alfie   
I supposed making it possible to navigate without having to step over things? But yeah, I 
would imagine that would be impossible. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
in in a magic world where anything is possible. 
 
Alfie   
Yeah, yeah. Make magic happen. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Come on, the magic and mystery exhibition. We can do it. Yeah. 
 
Alfie   
Maybe it phone app as well. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. Those are all the questions that I have. So, if it's alright with you, we'll have one 
more meeting and do some follow up questions. So I can send you those questions as well.  

371 
 
2.4. Follow-up Interview. 
We met at a café in York on 25 January, 2020 to conduct this interview. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, so how have you been 
 
Alfie   
I've been very well? How are you?  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Pretty good. Getting ready for a Viking Festival, which is always very nice stressy at work. 
Yeah, it'll be fine. So I'm just doing a quick recap of our visits and some follow up questions. 
There was a big difference for you between the movable and the stationary text boards. Was 
that right?  
 
Alfie   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. So being able to pick them up was helpful for them.  
 
Alfie   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. And then the ones on the wall, just awkward and 
 
Alfie   
yeah, some of them are good. Some of them weren't. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay. But by and large, the ones that you could pick up.  
 
Alfie   
Were better. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay. Now, you really like that it was a sensory experience. got lots of the senses 
involved, right? Yeah. Do you think that would change, that your experience would change if 
there were costumed interpreters around.  
 
Alfie   
I think that's always fun.  
 
Ashley Fisher   

372 
 
Yeah, okay. 
 
Alfie   
Not necessarily accurate but it's always fun. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And you mentioned a phone app. What would you like a phone app to look like 
 
Alfie   
to look like?  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Or just to do.  
 
Alfie   
Yeah. I like it to maybe have less text than the boards, some more I can listen to or have the 
option to do both, depending what you like. What's more, many of those things weren't 
actually about the building, and the building was the most interesting thing in a way. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
right So you said you would probably visit again?  
 
Alfie   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Would you still is that still okay all right. Did a barley Hall reminds you of any other museums 
that you visited in good or bad ways? 
 
Alfie   
Remind me of my home one?  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah,  
 
Alfie   
In the middle of nowhere in Hertfordshire.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
What's it called?  
 
Alfie   
Ashwell museum. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
is what's that one's about? 

373 
 
 
Alfie   
That one is more to the building style of it all, the main bit was actually house in the pop 
world. The place had an interactive feel, like your part of it more. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, tell me more about that. About the museum. 
 
Alfie   
Ashwell museum. Yeah. So it's basically this community museum. Okay. And it's run entirely 
by volunteers. Most of them were getting on a little bit 
 
Ashley Fisher   
as they tend to 
 
Alfie   
do, and it's always just really friendly there, as well, but it's similar to Barley Hall.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay.  
 
Alfie   
It's all being revamped, so I don't know what it's like now. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. Are there any stellar museum experiences that stand out in your memories that 
you've seen? 
 
Alfie   
 from Barley Hall?, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
 anywhere 
 
Alfie   
Oh, that's good question. There was one, but I doubt I'll be able to remember where it was 
 
Ashley Fisher   
that's okay. Can you tell me about it. 
 
Alfie   
Trying to remember other than the fact that it was great. Yeah. So many good ones in the 
past. Natural Museum, okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What do you like about it? 

374 
 
 
Alfie   
how big it is but also you getting the information that you need. Go and do as you wish. 
Okay. also fairly interactive if you go to the Dino center. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. do you think there's a there are different expectations in paying versus non paying 
museums? 
 
Alfie   
I think there is, in a way Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you want to explain 
 
Alfie   
in paying ones, you expects to be a little bit better standard, expect everything to be more 
accessible to everything but also in a way you expect to be slightly more simplistic, less 
information. More about just trying to bring people in while other than actually artefacts and 
stories and such. Okay. free ones it's all about a little information and you can talk to us to 
find out more information. Yeah, whereas in paid ones. It's more about come here, see this 
Yeah, yeah not really engaging with the material or the information at all. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So bit of a pessimistic view on paying versus non paying.  
 
Alfie   
Yeah, yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
 Okay interesting 
 
Alfie   
as a student I like things free 
 
Ashley Fisher   
understandably Yeah. 
 
Alfie   
I guess in paid ones expecting a little bit more spacious more open better facilities like better 
cabinets and stuff. Yeah. they actually have the money to invest in  
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah 
 
Alfie   

375 
 
I guess the people my mind in a free one or more friendly because that just like don't have to 
be Yeah they're volunteering mostly. Yeah. Yes. Then again, at Barley Hall, they were 
friendly, so yeah. That was a long answer for you. You're welcome 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thanks. I mean, these are good. Alright, um, do you really have a bad day versus a good 
day? for your disability.  
 
Alfie   
Not really  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Is it pretty just constant  
 
Alfie   
I guess. on a bad day I feel more tired I have less energy to put into trying to read stuff. 
Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So if we had gone on a bad day, 
 
Alfie   
I would not be able to read anything  
 
Ashley Fisher   
fair enough. 
 
Alfie   
I guess it's more of a mental attitude to it  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. This is quite personal question. So it's okay if you want. You want a minute? Do you 
consider yourself disabled? There's no right or wrong answer. This isn't a gotcha thing. So 
 
Alfie   
in some ways, yes. In some ways No. Okay. I don't notice it on a day to day thing. Uh huh. 
So rarely have the days where it's worse than others. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah.  
 
Alfie   
I don't really notice it, personally.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. 

376 
 
 
Alfie   
However, I think I do because it limits the sort of things I can do. If I compared myself to how 
I was say 10 years ago, things are completely different. Okay, I stopped doing cricket 
because I can't see the ball anymore 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It was really fun. 
 
Alfie   
I used to play rugby without contact lenses. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Oh wow. So would you consider yourself a disabled person or person with a disability? 
 
Alfie   
Person with a disability 
 
Ashley Fisher   
There's a lot of a lot of discussion and disability studies as to whether it should be person 
first or not. And right now, the leading consensus is it should be disabled person, but I feel 
like that's very exclusive of people with hidden disabilities.  
 
Alfie   
Okay,  
 
Ashley Fisher   
because every single person so far that I've asked, they've said person with a disability And I 
find that really, really interesting. So, yeah. Do you have any questions for me? Cuz that's all 
my questions. So  
 
Alfie   
not really  
 
Ashley Fisher   
okay, that's fine. If you do, please email me, if you remember that place. So yeah, thank you 
for being part of this research.  
 
Alfie   
I thought of one [cool museum experience]. Yes, it was in the Barbican in London, okay. And 
it was all about tech all about the ways in which technology has been built up. So it's less 
more about artifacts moves more in ways in which people have created artefacts, ah, 
modern archaeology. And it was a little things like Alan Turing's computer and one helps in 
the war. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

377 
 
Cool That actually sounds really interesting. Get exhibit. I'm gonna look that one up. That 
was the Barbican in London. Yeah. Wonderful, excellent. Yes. So if you remember any 
others, let me know. Thank you very much. Enjoy the rest of your day. 
3. Amanda. 
Amanda is a woman with psoriatic arthritis. 
3.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met Amanda at her home to conduct this interview on 8 November, 2019. 
 
Amanda   
The recording 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Oh, that's perfectly fine cat meows are completely allowed. Alright, so again, my name is 
Ashley, we've emailed a couple times. Yeah, and I just wanted to go over a few things to 
make sure we're on the same page before we get too far into it. So my research is looking at 
accessibility for people with hidden disabilities in museums and heritage sites. And you've 
been asked to be a participant because you have hidden disability, as I mentioned, we'll 
have three different meetings. One now, one, immediately after. Where we go to the 
museum in your case it's gonna be barley Hall, and I have a basic outline for things will do 
there. But by and large, I want you to leave the visit so I can understand how you experience 
a museum and how your hidden disability effects that experience. after the museum visit will 
go straight to a café or a pub or something like that, and have a chat about the experience 
as a whole. And then a few days later, we'll have our last meeting, where we'll talk about the 
museum visit again, and also about other museums and heritage sites that you visited and 
how they compare. That's all right. Good, excellent and we've done the information sheet 
and that. So I have a few questions for you. Once the kitty gets out, there you go, 
sweetheart. So, you mentioned that you have rheumatoid arthritis. Is that correct? Okay. And 
I've done it 
 
Amanda   
Well, it's under the umbrella of rheumatoid arthritis. Okay. My arthritis is psoriatic arthritis all 
based on psoriasis. Okay, so my parents have had severe arthritis so no severe psoriasis. 
Sorry, get it right. Okay. They had lots of skin problems. I don't have any skin problem. 
Okay. But I have the Arthritis that comes with that immune problem. Yes. System yes 
immune system problem. So my arthritis attacks, different things to rheumatoid arthritis. It's 
okay. So it's attacks cartilage, tendons and doesn't actually cause damage to them. It just 
caused lots of inflammation, inflammation and pain. And I get the general fatigue that all 
people with this type of inflammatory arthritis get. That's the you know, chronic fatigue is a 
problem. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Excellent. Well, that was my question. Yeah. So you're the expert. I've done a little 
research on it. Right is but I wanted you to explain it to me. And it's something that you're 
born with. Is that correct? Since 
 
Amanda   

378 
 
it was Yeah, it's passed down by to you from your parents yet you get it from your parents. 
Okay. Fantastic. Excellent. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. And throughout the day, or an extended number of days, how does it affect your daily 
routine? Yeah. 
 
Amanda   
If it's under control, it's not too bad. And I take drugs to keep it under control. I take two lots 
of injections a week. Okay, and that damps down my immune system. And that then means 
it's not attacking it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
Amanda   
But, I mean, I also have a second problem, which I would call it a disability. You know, I have 
heart failure. Oh, I have what I am being assessed but haven't been listed for transplant. 
Okay. So again, it's a it is still a disability. I would definitely Yeah. So I mean, that causes 
breathlessness causes lots of breathlessness and, and fatigue as well. Yeah. And so on a 
day to day basis. Well, I am now fully retired on health grounds because of my disability. And 
that's literally only just come through. I retired because I could No, I said the power need to 
retire actually. Carry on. Yeah, I'd already reduce my hours down to half time. Hmm. So that 
I didn't work full time. Sure had had assessments at work, too. I had a working pattern that 
allowed me days in between for rest days. Okay, but it was still not working for me. So I 
retired. And as part of my retirement, I said, I'd like to be assessed for retirement health 
grants, because I think that is, you know, what I require? Yeah. And basically, that just 
protects my pension.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Gotcha. I was going to ask what's the Yes, the difference because clearly, I'm not from this 
country.  
 
Amanda   
So you say if you retire early, your pension is reduced if you retire before the usual pension 
age, but if you retire under health grounds, then that pension is as is as if you had fully paid 
into it the council continue to pay it.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense. So, yes, 
 
Amanda   
so and then so on a day to day basis, and I don't get up as early as I used to do so I need 
extra sleep. So I even now need an alarm to wake me up more than when I was at work. 
That work pattern thing I was in was working but now it isn't. Yeah. So yeah, I can be feel 
like after I've been up half an hour. I feel like sometimes I just want to go back to bed. It's 
really hard. Really hard to push through. very stiff in the morning. I've got a right hip and my 
lower back. spondylosis of the spine is one of the side effects of this arthritis. My spines, 
lower spine is very stiff. And so yeah. So then as we get going things loosen up and you 
know, 

379 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
sure 
 
Amanda   
I need to keep the house really warm because I can't get cold. You know, I don't like going I 
don't go anywhere where it's cold. Yeah. If you somebody would say it shall we go down to 
such and such a) I couldn't walk because of my breathing. Yes, I properly wouldn't walk 
there today. It's too cold.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
It is. It's quite.  
 
Amanda   
So I don't do cold. I don't like going anywhere where it's cold. You know, so if the venue was 
cold, I would not go, or I'd leave early. Yeah. So I don't do cold. I don't. I always think about 
where, you know, there's somewhere sit down, because I don't have a walker. I think that's a 
bit of pride in me at the moment. I feel I want to go down that route quite yet. But I think it's 
you know, might do it at some point. Because, yeah, having somewhere to sit on going 
along. It's not a bad idea to be honest. I mean, my joints can be stiff and so difficult handles 
and you believe how many public buildings you know, hotels or whatever. These enormous 
doors that are so heavy they're always to pull. Never to push Yeah. And so yeah, that is just 
yeah unbelievable that. I don't do like heavy doors at all because my it's in my wrists and my 
fingers they're not as strong as they were sure. So that's difficult the steps of course any look 
lots of stairs, always will go for the lift Sure. And escalators or something like that. I have a 
blue badge for my car so I can park nearby things so I tend to use my car. I have got some 
what's called a benefit called PIP – personal independent payments, which is the mobility 
component of that. Okay, so that gives me some money towards using my car or any other 
transport, money to pay for Yeah, and again, I just will space things out throughout the week. 
I will never do two things in a row. For instance this week. On Wednesday day time, I was 
helping a friend or I was doing helping with the catering while her family were building a 
greenhouse, a large greenhouse thing. And I did that on Wednesday morning, and then I 
went home and Wednesday afternoon to rest because I have I do a bit of dancing to help my 
back. I do belly dancing, which is good for the back. Yeah. But in the end, I decided I didn't 
go to my dance and I was too tired. Because I've done that one thing. Yeah. in the morning. I 
thought it would be enough to rest up in the afternoon but it wasn't. So yes. So like my 
working week I tried to do one thing on one day, then have a rest day and then do 
something on another day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure, 
 
Amanda   
yeah. Just things that, you know, small things each day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I apologize for today. 
 
Amanda   

380 
 
No, no, no. That's fine. Now I've already factored that in. Okay. I've got nothing planned for 
tomorrow. And yesterday I was I had something planned in the morning, but I wasn't doing 
anything in the afternoon. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. 
 
Amanda   
Yeah. So I've already planned that in when you asked. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Thank you very much for that. 
 
Amanda   
Yeah. So no, that is important to me to plan things so that they spread out. Yeah, and it's 
just the problem with this. These sorts of inflammatory arthritis is you never know from day to 
day, when you're going to get arthritis, some sort of flare up, or the fatigue is going to hit and 
I was a little bit worried when we've made this day because last week, I was just in a fog all 
week. I know I really am struggling with fatigue and tired It's Chronic Fatigue is you know, it's 
not just feeling really tired it goes beyond that you can't function you can't think your brain 
just doesn't seem to want to. to work. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah, I have. I'm on medication for depression and I also have iron deficiency 
anaemia right now so I fully understand that. Just I'm so tired. I can't even watch TV right 
now. No, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yes. 
 
Amanda   
Yeah, absolutely. I yeah. And the game you know to fix your iron levels that medication my 
mom so I have iron infusions. No iron tablets, awful things 
 
Ashley Fisher   
do not like 
 
Amanda   
excellent. And 
 
Ashley Fisher   
for today, the visit last as long as you want it to there's a couple things that I want to make 
sure we hit but they're really simple things like that. Obviously, going to the admissions desk, 
checking the toilet Yeah, visiting a particular room that the on the ground level. So yeah, we 
don't need to worry about that and buying something from the shop. Yeah, I have five 
pounds, so you can use that. But it can last 20 minutes if you want it to, it's totally up to you 
fine. Okay. For the most part, I'm just going to be observing you as we go through the 
motions of everything.  
 
(Think aloud technique practice) 
 

381 
 
So I'll ask you, hopefully a couple times during our visit, to just think aloud. Yeah. Going 
around. And now you know what to do when I say that  
 
Amanda   
just thinking through is just as you're looking at it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes, exactly. Alright, so let's talk about how you prepare for a trip. Do you do any research 
ahead of time have a place? 
 
Amanda   
Not necessarily. I mean, I've been to Barley Hall before. I went a couple of Christmases 
before to one of their special evening events where there was some carols and some food 
and drink. Yes. And so You know, and that was just in a brochure of Christmas music. So I 
just selected it and we toddled along with a couple of friends. I tend to go with friends when 
I'm visiting someone. And so you know, we did a house and garden recently is [Burton] 
Agnes Hall. And we went there and I knew a little bit about it before going, but I didn't really 
know an awful lot. Often I could might be influenced by something I've read in a magazine or 
newspaper or seen an article on TV. Something about the place that I think Oh, yes, I'd be 
interested in going to that. Oh, yeah, I'd like to go see that particular painting, for instance, in 
a particular place, or the garden that's been recently made over to into certain scheme and I 
could look at that, as opposed to just saying, I'm going to go to X. I'd go to X because there 
was something I particularly wanted to see there. Okay. I have to say I don't go. I mean, to a 
lot of I'm annoyed that the art gallery is no longer free and that you have to pay for it. Yeah. 
But now that I'm retired, I think I'm, I've been retired now. Well, I haven't been to work since 
the beginning of September. I am reviewing things. And as I said, over these last couple of 
months, my financial situation is improving slightly so I may well, you know, review how I pay 
for things, but before when I was working, and I had more outgoings and things like that. I 
was annoyed at having to pay to go into the art gallery. You know, now I've got time I think I 
might not. worry and I got more finances, and I thought I would have. I might not quibble at 
paying. Sure. But yes. A lot of the time to Like, you know, residents weekend and things like 
that. I would plan a thing, Yeah, I'm going to do that. I'm going to go to a couple of those 
things this year. And then the weekend would come and I'm feeling lousy. So I will get. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
Amanda   
So yeah, so sometimes I think I'm going to do something and then it doesn't happen. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. Are there any specialist equipment or aids that you bring with you or anything like 
that? 
 
Amanda   
I'm not really know. I mean, I do have a special cushion for sitting down on or any cushion 
because I really, really don't like hard chairs. Sure. The tendon at the top of my leg is always 
very tender. And sitting on hard surfaces is not good. So I might bring it with me if I 
remember. So part of my problem is that I'm so I think that's partly with being at work so 

382 
 
used to just going on this track that I forget the bits that I can do. That helped me. And I get 
there and I think Oh heck I forgotten such and such. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah. Do you think that might improve over time as you're adjusting? 
 
Amanda   
Yes. Okay. I think now I'm, you know, planning things for myself from home. I'm getting 
better at it. Yeah. Okay. Bit more time to plan things. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you ever check out of a museum or heritage sites website before you go? 
 
Amanda   
I haven't done okay. I mean, but that's completely fine. You know, to me, but that's not to say 
that I'm you know, now that I've got my I was without a phone for ages. Well I did have 
a  phone, but it wouldn't connect to the internet or anything. Yeah. But my I will, you know, I'll 
sit here and I'll be having a conversation with my dad and will say, hey, so such and such 
and I'll straightaway go and look it up and see what you know, to So now my phone is more 
active then I do tend to look at things so if I hear somebody mentioned something I don't 
know, straightaway look it up Sure. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you plan for any eventualities or emergencies But no, 
 
Amanda   
no okay No, I'm a very spontaneous person so I don't think I do plan for you know what my 
Tony to see I always forget to take a bottle of water You know, I need to get better at that. 
Yeah, I do always have a make sure I've got some pain relief in my bag. So do I suppose I 
do in from that respect? At least I have something in my bag. I need to take a couple of 
tablets. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. And how much time does it take you to get ready for just going out? 
 
Amanda   
Not long. I usually start the day dressed for what's coming up? I don't need to go change and 
then I just need to grab my bag. Make sure I've got the keys. I am very bad at leaving my 
house keys so I've got two people with a spare key because I locked myself out. But yeah, 
and then just hopefully just go through the you know, grab this grab, grab, grab a bag, grab 
the phone, half the time I go out without my phone. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, so for the visit itself, we're going to do what we're calling a semi structured visit. That 
means that we follow your lead we just you can go wherever you want in the museum spend 
as much time as you like there whatever you want. I want this to be as normal a visit for you 
as possible. That being said, there's a few basic points I want to make sure we hit so for. For 
barley Hall, I want to make sure we visit the Great Hall which is like the second room that 
you see. asked the member of staff for help, purchasing small item in the shop and visiting 

383 
 
toilets. So yeah, fairly straightforward things that most people would do on a visit anyway, 
just want to make sure that we hit those things. It's easier to compare the different visits. And 
then after the museum visit will go to nearby pub or something. Yeah, have drink and snack 
and have a little bit of a debrief. Yeah. Excellent. I have a few questions for that. And I also 
want to do it while I'm calling a visit audit. But I have a sheet to go through that with you. So 
don't worry about that. Yes, so things like noise and light levels. How easy to read signs are 
you have enough seating, things like that? That sounds excellent. 
 
Amanda   
Yes. Wonderful. Yeah. I'm just debating. And I wear glasses. Okay. Sometimes I wear 
contact lenses and then now I'm just debating whether to contact lenses. I think I think I'll 
take my glasses. Okay. So it's when I'm reading things Which is better to me? Yes, I think 
my glasses are better. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, excellent. I have contact lenses but I have really terrible vision so I have to wear them 
all the time. Yeah. Excellent. Well, that's all I have for this part. So Okay, you ready? We can 
3.2. Site Visit. 
Our visit to Barley Hall took place on the same day. Due to a technical error, the audio 
recording did not work. 
3.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
After our site visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct this interview, still on the same 
day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. So we're going to go through this section right here. How easy was it to find the 
museum? 
 
Amanda   
 Fine – I know it's down Stonegate, so I mean, I don't know or remember which alley, but I 
know it was Yes, I did. I know vaguely where it is. And if I didn't know where it was I probably 
would look for it on my map [on her phone]. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
was it easy to find the entrance itself once you got to the building?  
 
Amanda   
Yes, yes. Yeah. Right. It was obvious. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah. How was the layout of the museum Was it easy to understand, difficult to 
understand? 
 
Amanda   
Difficult from the point of view of it didn't flow from one to the other okay, you had to find 
where you were, yeah, you know find the signs by the way yeah. it's quite a small site. Yeah. 

384 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
In the shop, was the signage easy to understand? 
 
Amanda   
The shop was bit strange. I always find gift shops in museums a bit strange because you 
don't know actually what they're going to be selling. And in what way they're going to link it, 
so it's a case of just wandering around and seeing what they got. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
was there enough space to move around the shop? 
 
Amanda   
Yes, yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And was it easy to navigate the shelf?  
 
Amanda   
Yes, yes. It was all sort of circular. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Now you visited the toilet so were the toilets easy to find?  
 
Yes. Good. Was it clean? 
 
Amanda   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
and was the floor especially clean? 
 
Amanda   
It's been a wet day, but I think it was relatively clean.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right and did any of the staff members- Do you feel that the staff members treated you 
any differently than another visitor? 
 
Amanda   
No. Probably because they didn't necessarily know I had a disability. I don't have a cane or 
anything right.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's my next question. Do you think they would have treated you differently if you did have 
a visible disability? 

385 
 
 
Amanda   
Okay, they might have asked, do you need to see, find anything. That sort of thing. 
Potentially they could have done. Yeah. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was the team member was able to offer the appropriate help when you asked for help? 
 
Amanda   
very informative I'm glad I 
 
Ashley Fisher   
did you feel welcome there 
 
Amanda   
Yeah, they were very friendly, I mean there weren't many staff on view, yeah, yeah but when 
they were around, they were very friendly.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
normally there's only two people that are on staff: the manager of the day and then a front of 
house that's on admissions till. Sometimes on the weekends we'll have some costumes 
interpreters but right yeah, yeah and sometimes volunteers as well. Yeah. So the exhibition 
where the displays clear?  
 
Amanda   
not always. not always okay. I found it difficult to read the white print on some of the 
backgrounds. Some of them were not as well lit. yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
alright were the fonts easy to read 
 
Amanda   
Not necessarily 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Not the best How do you feel about the colour contrast on the signs?  
 
Amanda   
I prefer just plain black on white. Okay. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. Um, there was only one video that I remembered in the entrance room – was the 
volume at that a good level. 
 
Amanda   
It was, I listened to a little bit of it, I was reading the timeline. Sure, 

386 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
where the stories of the experience and of the exhibition easy to read and understand 
 
Amanda   
I wasn't sure I got the full story of the house. Yeah, what it would have been like to have 
lived in that house. There were little bits of information dotted around, what they were eating, 
how it was prepared. I don't know if I got a full picture as to the story of the house.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
How as the over all noise level there.  
 
Amanda   
It was fine. It was a very- I mean that group that was in wasn't very distracting 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, they're actually really well behaved 
 
Amanda   
They were fine.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
were some places too loud? 
 
Amanda   
No, it was fine  
 
Ashley Fisher   
any place too quiet 
 
Amanda   
No, I quite like quiet. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
and what about the lighting levels.  
 
Amanda   
They, yeah, there were some places where I couldn't quite see and also you know, I like to 
see into a room – I have difficulty stepping into a room, so I do quite like to see what I'm 
stepping into this Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think there were enough places to sit or rest? 
 
Amanda   
Yes, there were benches placed around the place which you could sit on. That was good 

387 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. All right. So looking at the Great Hall, yes. Where the displays clear. 
 
Amanda   
Was that the one downstairs? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
 yes. It's perfectly okay to say no,  
 
Amanda   
no, I'm just trying to think if I noticed them. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, I'm trying to I don't think that there's any signage in the great hall. It's just lots of stuff 
on display. Yeah.  
 
Amanda   
I mean, you saw things on display. I think that room is more about just getting the feel for the 
place. I think it just calls itself the great hall. Yeah. I mean, there was no it didn't say you 
know, this is a fireplace, you were sort of left to figure it out, I suppose.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you like that or would you have preferred more? 
 
Amanda   
I could have got the booklet at the beginning, maybe that might have told me more. I saw a 
gentlemen going around with it. Okay, yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Oh, right. Was the lighting level in that area All right? 
 
Amanda   
No, it's fine. That was fine. Okay. Don't know if it's because of the glass wall. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It probably helped. Yeah. Alright, so now just some general questions. What is one good 
thing about the museum just in general? 
 
Amanda   
Easy to get to for me. Okay. Where I can park near to. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right and one bad thing about the museum in general. 
 
Amanda   

388 
 
Things were not easy to read. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And that's because of the combination of low lights, not the Greatest colour contrast. Yeah, 
it's not one specific thing. It's just 
 
Amanda   
Yeah, lots of things. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
what's one good thing related to accessibility or disability in that museum? 
 
Amanda   
toilets on the ground floor. Okay, right. Easy to get- the door was easy to open. You know? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes, yes. All right. And what's one bad thing about accessibility at the museum? What's 
something you think they can improve on?  
 
Amanda   
Oh, I see. Yeah When there was steps and things such steep steps, to get something like a 
grab rail. I wouldn't want to detract from with the home but something that was able to get a 
hold. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yes I'm positive we could find a solution that is in keeping with the rest of the house  
 
Amanda   
Yeah, yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right did any particular barriers jumped out to him? That made it even more difficult for 
you. 
 
Amanda   
the tiled floor in the Great Hall, it was sort of uneven and Okay, you know, I do unfortunately 
I can stumble easily Yeah, with walking you know, anything you know, it's just have to be, I 
was aware of having to be careful. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there any particular accessibility tools- that would have been helpful in there. Like 
maybe a one of those walking frames that turns out into a seat or a handheld cane or 
handheld lantern or something like that. 
 
Amanda   
Probably wouldn't.  
 

389 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So a walking frame, grab rails, and raising the lights in general 
 
Amanda   
yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Is there anything the museum could design into the exhibitions from the very beginning so 
like making sure that their fonts are a bit better and colour contrast 
 
Amanda   
Yeah, those sorts of things. Yeah. And maybe as I say, you know, information things in as 
you entering Yeah. There were one or two of those tablet type things, so if you hadn't 
purchased the book, it would be quite helpful. So say somebody you could pick up as you 
went in the room. That says the room you are now entering is such and such, been used 
for.. over the centuries it would have changed from X to Z. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And I saw you use your cushion a few times 
 
Amanda   
yeah with the hard benches around, I quite like to have that there. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
and how did the staff make you feel? 
 
Amanda   
They were friendly. I think the faff with the tea towels was embarrassing, I was in the shop I 
would have tried to do the transaction for the cheapest and then sorted out the issue later. I 
mean if I if I'd been here people behind me I might just stopped and said oh let's not bother. 
yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If you could tell them you see one thing regarding the accessibility of their site, what would it 
be?  
 
Amanda   
Well I understand that in York, in an old city, a medieval city, you know there are 
cobblestones everywhere. It's not easy and I think I would accept that Yeah. Yeah. I accept 
that it's part of these places. I can't remember now but not it was like a step over it probably 
was, It was I can't remember. Yeah. Sometimes they go to that other end, they 
overcompensate and it does take away from the experience of wanting to experience you 
don't want it to be to, you know, you want to feel like you're going to somewhere different. 
Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So would having that ramp there all the time. Would that have taken away?  
 

390 
 
Amanda   
Yes, yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay.  
 
Amanda   
Yeah. It was useful that day but you know, a grab handle or something would help.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right so anything else that you want to mention? 
 
Amanda   
[chat about the purpose of Barley Hall as an education tool and its lack of 'star item'] 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So would you visit Barley Hall again? 
 
Amanda   
No. I'd go to special events, maybe. Unless of course I had somebody come stay with me 
particularly interested. Okay  
 
Ashley Fisher   
That is all 
3.4. Follow-up Interview. 
We met at Amanda’s house on 19 November, 2019 to conduct this interview. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright. Excellent. So 
 
How were you feeling the next day after? 
 
Amanda   
So I got back here that afternoon as you say it was cold. So I think I think the rest of that 
day. what day of the week was it eight  
 
Ashley Fisher   
was excellent question. I no idea. I think it was a I want to say Thursday. I think it was I 
 
Amanda   
No, no, I think it was a Friday. Yes. It was a Friday because I had nothing else to do so that 
was quite nice. I think I just relaxed for the afternoon to be honest when I got back, okay, 
which is what suddenly after some an activity That is what I do. Yeah, I wouldn't do anything 
else. And by Saturday, I think I was probably fine. 
 

391 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Didn't have any, like, any negative side effects or 
 
Amanda   
No, I mean, I'm, if it was, I mean, I've been I've not been very well I've developed other 
problems might be doing to my arthritis. So I was poorly on Saturday, but I can't remember if 
it was that one. Sure. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
But now I wouldn't have linked it going out. 
 
Amanda   
So, yeah, so now it was fine. As they say, for the rest of the day. I didn't do anything for the 
team. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so one of the things that you mentioned was that you wanted there to be more 
accessibility. Things like grab rails and things like that, but she also didn't want it to take 
away from the atmosphere. Yeah, 
 
Amanda   
yeah. Yeah. So I hadn't thought of something the other day, we Yeah, I think it's somewhere 
else. Something like a rope a nostalgia room. Oh, yeah, I think I thought you bet. You know, 
it would have been a useful thing for just pulling me up or something. Yeah. Yes. I can't 
remember what why that came to me. When I was thinking about getting about Yeah. Also, 
where my shop I work in, we have a very steep step down to a different level in the shop. 
And so for accessibility for all our customers, we have a grab rail there. And I use that I 
myself got something in the other hand, yeah. So yes, that's a witness all that graduated I 
thought you know about things that we could use. Yeah. And I thought that the road route 
was brilliant. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I've been trying to picture you know, a piece of wood or something that just sticks out a little 
bit from the doorway wasn't quite working in my head. Yeah, but no, not broke. actually 
sounds. Written if 
 
Amanda   
you could just grab it and just stare at you and pull you up if you're going out, and it doesn't, 
it's not super stiff in there in the way. Yeah, exactly. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I like that idea. When you go around a museum, would you consider yourself the kind of 
person that reads everything or just kind of looks at things and reads here in there. 
 
Amanda   
So if I were to go to an exhibition like I went to the Pompei exhibition museum A few years 
ago, I would read everything because you as much as the crowd allows, of course, get the 
quite busy, but there's a special tech ops that got, you know, artifacts from all over the place 
which you wouldn't be able to go back and see when you know, they're also telling you a bit 

392 
 
of a story, the storyline usually going on in those places. So in those places, I would tend to 
read everything if I was going around somewhere buttonhole were probably I know a bit 
about medieval history of Europe because it seems that the local press all the time you know 
various places pop up here and there you know I go to them on like I said I went to a nice 
musically mean there gives me I might not read so much of all that stuff but it so unless the 
exhibition interested me I would read it otherwise I wouldn't really necessarily offer. Yeah. 
 
so but yes so what do you say for instance go around the auction Museum, I might read the 
bits that interest me that the artifacts that I would I wouldn't be interested in this is stuff that I 
might not be interested in seeing war things but actually I quite like war. But things that might 
not grab me so much to go for. And I like to look for my favourite thing. Go back some time. 
See it's still there. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, correct. Yes. 
 
Amanda   
I do tend to read labels. So I do like them to be able to see them easily and work out. Even 
the ones that have you know, went them in cabinets. It's not always easy to read them. So 
sometimes it's quite nice. I went to a nice Museum in Hania on Crete. Okay. Really nice, 
ancient Romans, you know, written ancient stuff, Greek and Roman stuff. There. And, you 
know, you might get a postcard with the information on in that sort of thing. Yeah. So you 
can say this. I saw that and it's, you know, remaining 2000 bc and what have you? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah. 
 
Amanda   
Got a box full of Postcards from all the places I visited. I did 
 
Ashley Fisher   
see your 
 
Amanda   
postcard. Yes, exactly. Yes. So yeah, I've got them from loads museums. Yeah, I keep 
everything. Just sometimes. The postcards, I can send us a card to someone. Yeah, to say 
hello. But sometimes I just keep them because it's quite nice. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, absolutely. We've been talking a lot about the temperature of day you think that had 
an impact on?  
 
Amanda   
Yes. Yeah. Perhaps if you know, we haven't arrange that day and I was thinking of going. I 
would put it off. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

393 
 
Yeah. Okay. To another day. That was another question I had if we had taken this trip on a 
particularly bad day, for arthritis 
 
Amanda   
Oh yeah, yes. Okay my arthritis was flaring. Yeah, yes I would because I would just be 
miserable I would be bad company. Hi. I wouldn't be able to enjoy it as well. Yeah Yes, I 
have I mean I've cancelled a weekend in London when I was going to stay with my niece my 
apprentice. Yeah, I do have to cancel things. But yes, although my niece in London her 
husband worked at the British Museum and which is quite new to Kings Cross Station. So 
they were always very good like meeting me. Or you know, even off the bus over to because 
said I was okay to go that far. But like when I was going home, and I want you to Curtis 
British Library to an exhibition. My nephew Loki took my case. met me at the station was 
very, you know, it's nice to be able to plan things with people, you know around hell. Yeah. 
So you know, so going to museums and things. It's quite nice to go with someone else. You 
know, so that if you're not feeling great, you know you you've got somebody I know I did the 
pump exhibition with a friend of mine, Joyce died from cancer. But yes, that was a nice day 
out with Joyce and even though it wasn't her cup of tea, she was very, she very kindly said 
he come. Yeah, you know, to support me so yes, I do like to have somebody else there. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. So you often go to museums with the least one other person. Yeah, yes. Yeah, 
 
Amanda   
yeah. Yeah, yes. Nowadays. Yeah. Me before. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
We also talked about the lighting quite watch you think it would that? Try that again? Do you 
think that the temperature or the lighting had more impact on your visit? 
 
Amanda   
temperature? temperature? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. The lighting to read things was a great 
moment. I mean, it was a dull day. Well, it was quite overcast that day. Yes, I think that may 
be you know, as I say, in some places, of course, they can't buy things very brightly because 
of conservation with the objects or whatever. So that's when it's quite useful for me to have 
an information sheet for that route. Yeah. Which you can then take to where there's a good 
light to read. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And you said you likely wouldn't visit Barley Hall again. 
 
Amanda   
Not to say I had a visitor who was very keen to go from there quite happily go with them. I 
wouldn't necessarily go back myself now. If there's an event going on it's quite nice to be 
able to go specially into the whole main course. But yeah, as I say, there's so much stuff in 
New York you can just fall over it you know, my little shop I work in next door to the 
merchant adventurous the building I work and it's all you know, pretty old. Yeah. Oh. So this 
plenty you can actually see and bumped into without actually having to go back to one 
particular place. I felt when I was going around follicle. It seemed more than like a museum 
at the auction museum where you go to the story of your co Particular artifact you may be 
wanted to see that image of jewel. barrio was like a resource for schools because it taught 

394 
 
the story of the Middle Ages very, very easy, compact way. Yeah. And I think not good also 
for tourists, you know who don't make it come from a city which is full of evil stuff. Sure. It's 
an easy accessible way of gaining information and, and an experience of a medieval home. 
Yeah. But it seemed a more of a resource, an actual venue, it's a great place to go. And 
also, I think, if I was compared with what I did a few weeks ago when I went to Burton, 
Agnes, which is gardening friends and we were going particularly for the garden as well as 
the house So, if you get two words not to one as such, because you pay for them both, but 
sometimes you need to combine it with a garden as well. Hmm. And also the home was 
lifted. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
Amanda   
So that's, you know, it's another thing you know, as the people, the guide, so curators, 
whoever they are, who are hanging about place, say is, you know, come by the program, we 
shut the door, we take out these ropes from the family moved back into these rooms, you 
know, yeah. So a place that's lifted, as well, I think has a deeper connection somehow. It's, 
it's, you know, it's been like that all these years. It's had a history of its ups and downs, but 
the family is still there. And it's just thinking you know, the, the ladies room so loud or 
whatever you It's been bad or furniture in it at some things that sort of give you the 
experience of what it was. Because the only room that had that to be truthful was the main 
hall, isn't it? Yeah. And maybe some of the kitchen areas you know where they put a few 
pots, dishes out. The upstairs rooms pop from one chest seat. Yeah, there was nothing 
there. Because I remember visiting Richmond castle what which one anyway, Mary, Queen 
of Scots. And, allegedly This is how bad it was always quite interesting. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think there are different expectations put on pain versus non pain? 
 
Amanda   
I wish our gallery was non pain. I will be somewhere I would go to I think if it was non paying, 
yeah. I suppose you know, I'm retired I become a member, a friend dog and you know, we 
have to go and access it that way more often, maybe this year. So I mean, the non paying 
ones tend to bigger. Be honest, like the railway museum and you know, people from all over 
first, maybe this is where you have to pay a smaller. maybe don't have to wider retraction. 
Yes, it is harder for them I'm sure to make their way and to get people in to make you pay its 
way. In a way, you know that we sometimes I see programs on TV, somewhere up in 
Glasgow, some great big Art Gallery, which is fast enough all sorts of stuff in. And I just think 
that must be just such a thing to be able to say, Oh, you know, Sunday afternoon, it's all just 
crammed down there and see what's going on. And families don't have to think about all 
that. You know, we've got three kids and we've got two from next door now. It's still that 
critical. We could just go down there and have a great time. And I think that's what's so 
good. You know, I mean, I used the railways here when I was looking after my friends, 
children many years ago. When she was working, and you know, he just knew that that was 
a place you could go and they would enjoy it. And you could have a good look around at the 
same time. And yeah, and it was great. But you wouldn't be able to do that with children for 
instance, if you are paying all the time. Yeah. And I think as a city we don't apart from the 
railway museum that is about the only place that's non paying. So you know, when I go to 
London, you just go around the mall? Yeah, go to me, various ones. And I don't mind paying 
for special exhibitions because you know, that she has I've had to bring things in from all 
over the place. And it sounds really interesting. So yeah, I mean, I quite like Chris Michael to 

395 
 
get out to them because of the one of the fish museum. Troy Yeah. But no, it's normal. 
penguins. I think I would go to more of a having said that I have been to the museum for 
ages to walk. Yeah, it's quite big. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So my last question is quit personal one. So feel free to say you don't want to. Do you 
consider yourself disabled? 
 
Amanda   
Definitely. Yeah. Yeah, there's no I mean, yes. Yeah, I mean, I've retired on health grounds. 
My health is not good. And yes, and it's, it's a really difficult one, you know, I thought I was 
posting a letter yesterday I was in the car outside the West offices where I used to work and 
I saw a friend and the walk down the window and she was look somewhere and that's what 
sets difficulties you know, yeah. Yeah, really hard to, you know, get through the day 
sometimes. You know, worry, you know, now our marketing was gonna be that it's gonna be 
okay. For a few weeks to know how quickly can we go to Syria, right? Yeah, it's lots of things 
to think about. Yeah. So yes, I do definitely, you know, I don't feel any guilt. Now. I used to, 
you know, with my blue badge and popping out five things. You know, I do find it restricts 
how I can get about, you know, planning things like a trip to London is no longer just like Oh, 
can I be a couple of weeks time?  You know, I don't know how I've been feeling. Yeah. The 
holistic Council. Yeah. trip to London that long ago. So yeah, I do very much feel my health 
conditions are disappointed to save me from being able to share. Yeah, you know, act 
behave like I used to do. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Yeah. Would you consider yourself a disabled person or a person with a disability?  
 
Amanda   
person with a disability? Okay. Yeah, yes, definitely. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
There's very interesting debates and disability studies as to whether the general preferred 
term should be disabled person or a person with a disability. And yet once you start actually 
looking at the nuances, it's very interesting that people with visible disabilities prefer to be 
called disabled people. Yeah, people with hidden disabilities very much prefer to be here 
person to the disability. Yes. And I think it's very much lost in the Raider compensation. So, 
very interested this particular question. 
 
Amanda   
Yes. After rematching Yes. And yes, you know, somebody in a wheelchair has no use of 
their legs is a disabled person. Yeah, you know, they might have had an accident or 
whatever, and they're now disabled. Yeah, they may have been born like that, and have 
lived with a disability or lack and they are disabled. But there was a lot of us, the things have 
crept up on us. And we live with whatever it is, particularly when it isn't there all the time. 
You know, things like my arthritis, you know, has flare up and I'm good days and you know, 
be fine. And then then I will have a number of days when it will just feel dreadful, and that's 
when it's flaring. And that's when I know my arthritis is not good.  And my heart is a different 
thing altogether. Stop in my tracks all the time. Yeah, just about, unfortunately. But yes, no, 
you know, I have someone who has acquired, you know, various things. And that caused me 
to now have a disability that I'm living with. Very good.

4. Amy. 
Amy is a woman with anxiety, hypermobility, and OCD. 
4.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met Amy at a café to conduct this interview on 17 November, 2019. The audio recorder 
stopped recording after the first few minutes, so I emailed her the questions from the 
interview to have her exact words. The email follows. 
 
I've known I've had anxiety since a young age but as a child I didn't really understand it. I 
just thought I was a 'worrier'. After a bout of bad mental health when I was an early teenager 
I was diagnosed with anxiety and then later OCD. It's very hard for me to be able to tell the 
difference between the two so I'll just describe them as one. I frequently get into thought 
spirals where I can't control what I'm thinking, sometimes these lead to me having to act on 
these thoughts but often they don't, it depends on the nature of the thoughts. When I do 
have to act on them they're almost always about organisation. I often have my day planned 
by the hour for weeks ahead of time (I currently have until a week on Sunday planned).  I will 
often do things like decide I'm going to do something next week and I can't stop thinking 
about it until I write it down in my plan somewhere. I will also often need to do things last 
minute but have the inability to do them until I've worked it into my plan, and will refuse to do 
things that I actually want to do (such as seeing friends) because it is not how I planned the 
day to go. Something that causes me a lot of anxiety is other people's health, I often get into 
thought spirals that lead to panic attacks where I am convinced that someone I love is unwell 
or in danger. These are extremely damaging to my own mental health but also to my 
relationships because it's a lot of pressure to have to deal with in the moment, especially 
when I'm directing so much anxiety and panic their way. One of the other major ways it 
affects my life is food. I have a lot of OCD surrounding food that has existed for as long as I 
can remember. I'm afraid of contamination and find things like washing up other peoples 
dishes difficult (and sometimes my own). The main issue is that I have a very short list of 
'safe foods'. Everything else I can't eat. This is difficult to explain because it's not just a 'I 
don't think this' but it's like my body can't accept that it's food. I will really physically as well 
as mentally struggle to eat these foods. This doesn't bother me as much because I don't feel 
like I'm missing out on foods as my brain has a hard time even accepting that it's a thing that 
can be eaten.  
  
I was recently diagnosed with hypermobility syndrome as it took me a long time to work out 
that what I was experiencing wasn't the norm. For as long as I can remember I have had 
joint pain. My ankles and wrists would constantly ache as a child and I would tell my parents 
about it but it was constantly dismissed as 'growing pain'. I get frequent subluxations (partial 
dislocations) in my fingers, wrists, toes and knee. Over time these become less painful but I 
have clear memories of being in agony as a child due to knee and toe pain. I now recognise 
these occasions as early subluxations. I would say things like 'my ankle hurts' to teachers in 
PE and they thought I was trying to get out of sport, or I would borrow my dads wrist brace a 
lot and my dad said I have carpal tunnel but my mum thought I was trying to 'look cool'. As I 
grew older I would tell my mum that I don't think my hips look right and I was getting a lot of 
back pain and rib pain. She told me it was normal and it was because I was sitting at the 
computer for too long. It turned out I have a scoliosis caused by my hypermobility and that all 
my joint pain wasn't normal. It took me till getting to university and learning about other 
people's experiences to realise this. Over the past few years I also believe that it has gotten 
worse. I am in almost constant pain in some way, and although this is usually quite low level 
it causes chronic fatigue and brain fog which mean I can get easily overwhelmed and my 
pain/fatigue levels can quickly get out of control if I don't manage it. For example I can stand 

397 
 
for long periods of time however the pain it causes will likely mean i can't do much for the 
rest of the day, I can sit down for hours at a time but it will likely make my back sore and 
keep me awake at night etc. It's something that I constantly have to think about and adapt to. 
It's also something that I really struggle to admit to myself due to being dismissed for so 
long.  
  
Due to the need to plan I will likely look at a museum a long time before I plan to go. I will 
have made plans with someone to go and I will know exactly how to get there (though due to 
the compulsion to constantly check things before I leave I am often late to things) and where 
we're meeting etc. Most of the pre-planning is spent working out how to get to a place and 
where I will be meeting someone. I will find the way that requires the least amount of walking 
and if there are long periods of walking that are unavoidable I will look into getting an uber 
some of the way or find out if there is a café or somewhere to rest inside. Cafés are often 
something that I look for because having small snacks throughout the day is something that 
helps my fatigue levels (I also have low blood pressure caused by hypermobility so it's better 
for me to have small amounts of food throughout the day than eating bigger meals). If there 
isn't any cafés I will look at the rules of taking food inside so I can take plenty of liquid and 
enough snacks. I will sometimes look up how long the museum would take to visit so I can 
work it into the plan for the rest for the day but also work out what I need to bring with me. 
The night before I leave I will have everything ready as I struggle in the mornings due to 
fatigue but also this is an OCD habit that has developed over the past year or so. Something 
else I will also check is the prices and if they do a student discount so I know if I need to take 
a student card. 
4.2. Site Visit. 
Our visit to Treasurer’s House took place on the same day. 
 
Amy   
I didn't know about the eyes until I saw this but now I want to find the eyes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I like them but they're also quite creepy scary  
 
Amy   
I like the question mark there like why? I supposed if you have in your house, nobody's 
gonna talk about any other bits. Just gonna be like he has to be a total like mess. You're just 
gonna be like... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
The chairs have eyes Interesting the first person that's figured out 
 
Amy   
That I can sit here. they've made it look like it's part of the room. Which I understand why 
they would do that but also it means that I'm like... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
That is something that was remarked upon 
 
Amy   

398 
 
I know I can't sit on that, but this... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I think after a while people just give up 
 
Amy   
I like these 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What do you like about them?  
 
Amy   
I like that I can pick it up and take it around with me So I don't feel like I'd have to stand in 
front of it or take it away from everybody else. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. 
 
Amy   
This one isn't too bad. It's quite well lit, like the other one... I know I was definitely going to 
get a headache if the rest of it was like that. I know it's not anything to do with me being 
difficult.  
 
- 
 
Amy   
No, I didn't know that. I'm going to sit down 
 
Staff member   
So I'm going to come... [talking about Frank Green buying up old houses that were going to 
be demolished] Whether it was preservation because of the culture of...  don't know. Yeah, 
it's 
 
-  
 
Amy   
I like this (banister edging) 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What about it? 
 
Amy   
I like that I can lean against it. It's very helpful. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 

399 
 
 
Amy   
Probably shouldn't, probably not... sturdy enough. Yeah, yeah. So this is annoying (garland 
on banister). pretty, but annoying. This is something else that I get, the fact that I'm walking 
up the steps but I get dizzy 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Is that a blood sugar thing 
 
Amy   
I don't know. Yeah. Maybe the bed is the thing [causing the sag downstairs] we are probably 
over that we are right now, but I think it might be. Yeah, it might be that one on the back. 
Yeah. Hear loud on that one. You know why?  
 
- 
 
Amy   
I was like What? I am bad at directions. Yeah, because we can. Oh, yeah, right. Oh, yeah. 
Oh yeah, I see.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I could feel it for sure.  
 
Amy   
I'm just very bad at directions. It just when we came around the staircase. Yeah, disoriented. 
Yeah. Really enjoy things like that but I don't know why.  
 
- 
 
Amy   
Just want to lay on the table, but it's probably not...  Good idea, especially when the stairs 
was so not... They're not even shallow Oh, yeah. I'd rather they were shallow than like the 
one and a half step ones, they're the worst. did we go in here? Yes, we did. Yes, we did that 
count. Really appreciate all the tiny little creepy things on This is really pretty (garland on the 
banister). It's annoying that it means I can't put my hand on it, so I just thought I'd share that 
opinion. Well, that wasn't intentional. So conscious decision. Okay. No, that's my favourite 
one. Look at one oh my goodness. Does that mean this was an extension or does he  just 
like having windows? Well 
 
- 
 
Amy   
I could spend all the time here. I'd changed this pink carpet. Yeah, the cream's a lot better. I 
mean, I realized that this isn't aimed at me but I'm going to point out that it was quite difficult 
for me to get out on the floor. I mean, it's probably in the people who are shorter than me 
quite yet also. Yeah, but also like, why don't I get to enjoy it? 

400 
 
4.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
After our site visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct this interview, still on the same 
day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How well do you think things were signposted? 
 
Amy   
Ummmmmm well there was a signpost but it's not really easy for us to find other. [It helped 
that they said they were next to the Minster]. Yeah, just looking already right next to it. Right 
there was a really important sign once again, but ... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And how easy would you say it was to get around? 
 
Amy   
Oh, not the best. I enjoy having a walking system [aka defined path to follow] because I 
enjoy not having to make any decisions and I enjoy where I can making sure that I see 
everything that the museum wants me to. And in some ways there was a pretty obvious path 
but in some ways it wasn't – there was quite a few times I was like have I been in there in 
that have I not. This is not a major thing but like I would prefer there to be like [a suggested 
route] I don't know if that's very possible in there. some places where a lot easier to like the 
big staircase that was okay, like it had the left hand railing, though it was annoying that they 
had the wreath over and some cases were less easy like the second staircase so we went 
up.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
From the Great Hall to the gallery.  
 
Amy   
Yeah. it was like if someone is- because it's quite small, it someone coming down, It's hard 
to like- which is why I let those other people go in front of me because I could be quite slow 
right. And then the last one as well from the gift shop again that was like you can't really 
have two people passing and that was a little bit more difficult to walk down but it did have 
good bannisters, I'll give it that. Yeah. But yeah, the rooms themselves were pretty spacious. 
There wasn't really like anything massively in the way there wasn't really anything where I 
was like oh, this is physically difficult to get around. The one where all those family portraits 
were, it was a little bit smaller, a little bit more awkward to get around the table so there was 
like way... like a bottleneck. Yeah. Which I think is important to me because I don't want 
people to be stuck behind me. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Something you're quite aware of. 
 
Amy   
Yeah. When like, if people can You know if people are still behind me, but at the same time, 
if I was stuck behind someone else.. I just think like if someone is – someone is like slower 
than me going up the stairs it's, it's also difficult to be behind them. Like I have to go to the 
speed that I go, if that makes sense. and slowing it down and speeding up this painful so like 

401 
 
if I can't get around someone, of if someone can't get  around me. Yeah, both of those all 
like relevant.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay so now we're going to go through the visit audit. So a lot of these are yes or no 
questions but was it easy to find the museum from the street? 
 
Amy   
There was a signpost but it's... I'm not 100% sure it's like anything that I can really credit to 
myself because it was just like where it is – like it's not the easiest to find. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was it easy to find the entrance from the street? 
 
Amy   
No, I didn't immediately know where it was until I saw you walking that way and I was like, 
oh, but if I suppose... Sorry, I'm not answering these yes or no.. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
No, no, you're fine! I'm just used to everyone going Yes. By all means expand your answers. 
And you didn't find the way around to be easy to understand. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, I mean, it was okay. I don't know. I guess I didn't really look anything like the little 
gnome trail, I didn't know about it, but it was you know, it was happening there wasn't like, if 
I'd gone in and I'd seen like a big thing about it. I'd totally picked up a leaflet for that, but I 
didn't know what was happening until you had to tell me about it.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
And I only knew that because I look at every single piece of paper and flier that a museum 
puts out and I happened to grab one. Yeah, when I was there., 
 
Amy   
If I'd known about it, because it [I like things like that] Yes. And also it is like a structure to it, I 
can be like oh, well, I've done- I've seen all of it you know? And it's just a cute fun thing to 
do.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think the map would have been helpful. Either handheld or on stands or?  
 
Amy   
Um, I think.. I didn't know like, that's the thing, if there was an actual map, I probably 
wouldn't have looked at it because I just would have been bored. I like talking a lot. Yeah, 
but something like that where like, it's like a trail or something like that. I definitely would look 
at it, as it would be more engaging, right.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
So a map that's more.... 

402 
 
 
Amy   
Yeah, something I can actually do yeah, like if I go off as well... So I know where I am on it, 
but then I forget which rooms I've been in so far. So obviously if I can mark it off, [but I 
wouldn't want to do that on a plain map] but then like, doing it as a trail you're doing that 
anyway. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thinking about the shop was the signage in there easy to understand 
 
Amy   
Was there signage?  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I mean, there were some labels and there was a sign on the till that said, take these upstairs 
 
Amy   
Was there? I ignored that. and I looked at it and went Yes, that means here. I clearly what I 
mean clearly not Yeah, I don't know if that was me just not reading it but I..  
 
Ashley Fisher   
No it's actually a very common thing not just amongst my participants but amongst all 
visitors.  
 
Amy   
If it's a till – a till that's not in use, put like a sheet over it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Otherwise it just invites people to stand out there. Yeah. Was there enough space to move 
around the shop? 
 
Amy   
There was when I was the only one in there, I think it might be real difficult for us with people 
in there 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right, so where the toilets easy to find 
 
Amy   
Noooooo 
 
Ashley Fisher   
where they clean 
 
Amy   
Yes 

403 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
was the floor clean.  
 
Amy   
So I didn't pay attention to it, which means it probably was yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It didn't stand out to you. 
 
Amy   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, thinking about the staff, the staff members treated any differently than another visitor.  
 
Amy   
I don't think so. The guy was pretty cool about me going and sitting although he didn't- I did 
notice that when I went and sat down, he didn't follow me. So he stayed on the other side of 
the room because the second time I went to go sit down. I said I'm just gonna go sit down 
and then he stayed standing there so I couldn't really hear him I kind of needed him to like, 
follow me. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think that was because of you sitting down and then his I don't want to say 
awkwardness but his own patterns. Where is it because he threw off this pattern or would 
you think? 
 
Amy   
I don't know I think he probably just didn't think about it. Like he was in his flow. Yeah. And it 
didn't cross his mind with an issue 
 
Ashley Fisher   
[Were they able to answer your questions adequately?] 
 
Amy   
He answered my questions! specifically for health about like seats are- Even though the 
seats were annoying. But yeah, he answered all my questions 
 
Ashley Fisher   
clearly you were sitting in the correct seats otherwise they probably would feel... 
 
Amy   
yeah I mean it did check them and they didn't say anything on it so I just assumed it doesn't 
say anything, [it's okay]. 
 

404 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I think that's a fair assumption. Did you feel welcomed at the museum? 
 
Amy   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thinking about to the museum as a whole – where the displays clear? 
 
Amy   
Yes. There wasn't actually a lot of like written information anywhere. I like I would have liked 
a little bit more. As I said, I liked the idea of that oddities trail. I enjoyed that a lot, but I only 
saw two of them. There was probably more but it weren't immediately obvious sure. But I 
think did like how they had two of them (the handheld interpretation boards) on there. Yeah. 
So I could take one. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were the fonts easy to read. 
 
Amy   
Yeah. Like it was just a pretty standard...  
 
Ashley Fisher   
was the colour contrast alright? 
 
Amy   
 Yeah but it was quite dark colours.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
It was sort of gray on gray. 
 
Amy   
Like it was fine when there was enough light. Yeah. But like if you got them in a pretty dark 
room, [it'd be difficult to read.] 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah. 
 
Amy   
It's mostly didn't know where it was going. Yeah. I understand why they need to keep a dark. 
though. I just find it interesting in the drawing room when it was a choice, they said that they 
chosen to make it dark. Yeah, I thought that was interesting because it worked really well. 
But from an accessibility point of view 
 
Ashley Fisher   
it's a choice. 
 

405 
 
Amy   
Yeah. I mean, I probably could to be fair I quite like things being a bit darker – not if I'm 
reading things obviously. Yeah, just I find it more calm and neutral. Yeah, interesting.  But 
there's not that much to read in there, to be fair. Just the guy talking really. Yeah, so I'm 
guessing there it did kind of work. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. There wasn't a whole lot that's dependent on reading which is you know, benefit of 
them not having signs anywhere. 
 
Amy   
Yeah. I liked having those personal boards in every room. When there's too much text, I'm 
just not... not gonna read it. Yes, no. So I liked that there was a person I could actually talk 
to. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I find that interesting. Because with your anxiety is clearly not about talking to strangers  
 
Amy   
never has been okay. Yeah, as you probably figured by the amount of times I was like "hi!" 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I have similar personality. I'm totally okay going and asking for information and still have 
crippling anxiety. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, well, that's the thing. Like, I'm going to overthink everything I say, but I'm still gonna 
say it.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes, exactly. 
 
Amy   
Which I think is the best to tackle it. I mean, it's not, I'd rather not do the overthinking, but 
you're gonna do it anyway. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
At least go through it with it. have a reason to be anxious. Was the volume for the videos at 
a decent level? 
 
Amy   
I mean, it was loud enough. It was just all wrong Yeah I did already watch well no I don't, but 
it was like it was like uncomfortable. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I have had someone actually take the headphones off. 
 

406 
 
Amy   
I was thinking about taking them off. and that was mostly just the mix of at all. It was the, like 
the it almost sounded like microphone feedback. Like the fuzziness of it was no fun to listen 
to and only have like, loud like steps just like come out and no it just was all the whole thing 
was so uncomfortable. I did think about taking off but also I wanted to know..  
 
Ashley Fisher   
one thing I will say that they do have captions on that video automatically.  
 
Amy   
Did you know, I didn't even notice that. I mean, I personally have perfect hearing. I haven't 
had it tested but I put captions on everything. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I process things better by seeing rather than hearing. 
 
Amy   
Yeah,  
 
Ashley Fisher   
so I have to have captions on. Well, maybe this is an OCD thing. Just to make sure I don't 
miss anything. 
 
Amy   
Well, that's the thing. I didn't realize how much I was missing until I put the captions on. 
Exactly. And I was like, I mean making caption. I've not heard that. Like, I can, like, go back 
on the thing and I'd be like, there's no way I would ever have heard  that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
Amy   
I didn't realize how much I was missing out on TV shows? Yeah. And especially because I 
watch a lot of sci fi as well by quite often it's quite loud and fast. Like Doctor Who is a really 
bad example for he talks so quickly and goes through everything and I'm like, just put on the 
subtitles. She, she and I was specifically thinking about Peter Capaldi because of how 
difficult he was [to understand]. 
 
- 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, so we're the stories and the tales of the museum easy to understand. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, yeah. I found the Woman a bit difficult to follow. The one that- she was telling me 
about the portraits. But for some reason the brain just stopped working halfway through and 
she was telling me something. Yeah. And I wanted to listen to her, but my brain was just a 
bit more of a difficult time with that. Yeah. I don't know if it was just because I've had loads of 

407 
 
information at once. Yeah, like, I'm starting to feel a little bit tired now. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But 
the ghost stories before. I could listen to that. 
 
- 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What was the overall noise level? 
 
Amy   
Yeah, I thought it was okay. I don't like it when it's too quiet because I don't feel like I can 
say anything. But I don't like it when it's too noisy either but for my tastes,  I think it was okay 
there was enough people to have a little bit of a babble but it was alright. But the ticking 
clocks were a little bit annoying. They were fine when I was there for like a minute or so but if 
I... I don't think I could have sat in that room. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
were there some places that were too loud 
 
Amy   
I don't think so, I think the café might get quite loud because this is such an enclosed space 
but I didn't notice it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
were there any places that were too quiet 
 
Amy   
I think the drawing room was on the side of it but I think because I was chatting to the guy 
wasn't too bad. Yeah. I think because there was someone there, at no point did it the feel 
like.... sometimes you go to these old houses and it feels like you have to like swaddle you 
up as you walk around, like the only sound is your footsteps and I hate that. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
How was the lighting level. 
 
Amy   
And I quite liked it. I quite like things being a bit darker. I get a lot of headaches, I have a 
muscle problem in my eye, it's quite common thing it's called [????] And it's a thing that 
happens to most people, but it's like one of those things. It's only there when it's there, so 
like I wouldn't have a headache. You would have a headache today, you know what I mean? 
Some people are just more prone to it, you know, so it's not like technically a diagnosis 
because you can't diagnose Hey, right, you know what I mean? I'm just really susceptible to 
it. But it's where it's like, my eyes are pulling towards centre again, most. Most people do 
that. But sometimes when I like to try and pull it back a bit further and it called is like muscle 
ache, basically. And it's like basically just normal eyestrain. Most people will experience it at 
some point, but I'm just for some reason, really susceptible to it. So things like when 
somewhere's really bright, or really dark, I can get a headache from it. And the only thing 
that fixes is special glasses I've got because they're not made for sight, they're made for 
fixing the muscles I can only see up to about here [about 4 inches from her face] but 

408 
 
because they're like a really strong prescription that like, Mine isn't like mine at all. For the 
Yeah. So I can only really use it whenever I see a book like this. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So that's not a pair of glasses that you would just carry around with you 
 
Amy   
No, and sometimes I do if I want to go away for a few days, but like there's no point in me 
putting my bag because I can't, like I can't see it. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
So do you think any places were too light 
 
Amy   
No, I don't think so 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What about to dark?  
 
Amy   
I think the first room that I went in was too dark to read the thing. The drawing room was very 
dark. But I quite liked it. It would have been an issue with something to read. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right.  
 
[discussion about tea and coffee] 
 
So were there enough places to sit and or rest? 
 
Amy   
Yes, but they weren't labelled very well. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
You are the like I said, You're the first person that's actually notice where the places to sit 
are. 
 
Amy   
there is actually a lot. There is actually loads of places to sit they're just labelled so badly. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, I very much agree. Especially when they literally put a red chair that you can't sit into 
next to a red chair that you can. 
 
Amy   

409 
 
Yeah. And there was a lack of places for me to lean on. Quite often. If I'm talking to 
someone I don't want to have to go to the other side of the room to sit down. I just want to 
have like take the weight off of my legs just a little bit just or like rest my backpack on the 
tables, rest my shoulders a little bit less or just something  
 
Ashley Fisher   
very, very normal. Yeah. 
 
Amy   
There wasn't many places to do that. And the places I could do that I wasn't 100% sure if I 
can get there's a table in the middle of the room. Am I allowed to lean? Yeah, and those 
weren't as clear because they didn't have anything written on them. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, they were quite [??] about which ones had labels and which ones didn't? Yeah, 
 
Amy   
yeah. So I didn't want to assume that the ones without labels were okay because there's the 
chairs it was obvious because they did have a lot of labels. The tables were a bit 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah. In that family room, I think the table was okay to sit at and lean on. There was another 
desk against the wall that didn't have a sign on it was clearly a desk that opens up, so 
tempted to go over to it and open it up. 
 
Amy   
There's quite a lot of signs saying what you can't do. There's not many signs saying you're 
allowed to do, like you're fine. You can lean on that table. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
negative reinforcement vs. positive reinforcement. So what was one good thing about 
museum in general? 
 
Amy   
The guides were really good. The guides. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And one negative one bad thing about the museum just in general. 
 
Amy   
The thing that annoys me the most was the decorations on the banister. That was like such 
a... I don't know there's something about that where I was like someone is clearly not even... 
like hasn't even crossed their mind that that might be an issue. Like it hasn't even like 
 
Ashley Fisher   
that people actually use bannisters. 
 

410 
 
Amy   
Yeah like they didn't even and it's completely unnecessary but we just have to put it a little 
bit further over 
 
Ashley Fisher   
to make sure it's tied to the side Yeah. Yeah. So what is one good thing about accessibility 
for the museum 
 
Amy   
I like the cards.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
And what's one bad thing about accessibility for the museum? 
 
Amy   
the adventure we had to go on to get to the toilets. And also because the door was really 
heavy but it wasn't that bad at the moment the like, if I, for example, I caught open bottles, 
the movements really difficult and like putting any kind of like where my wrist really hurt. So 
they have been much heavier than that. I found this to be able to... I just have to like use my 
elbows on here. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, there was a very heavy door. Did any barriers jump out at you? 
 
Amy   
 Oh, yeah, just something that was noticed as well and I didn't know is because I checked 
my profile because there's no signal in the toilets. Yeah. And which isn't a really an issue for 
me but if you were someone who like fell over a lot or like passed out or whatever. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. And there weren't any like 
 
Amy   
Pull cords – yeah, like, like, I'm not expecting you to put a pull cord and every single toilet 
but if you don't have signal-  
 
Ashley Fisher   
if you don't have signal. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, well, even just like a bell. Yeah. Just anything. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, cuz you can't predict how often toilets are used, so someone could honestly be sitting 
there for 20 minutes and if they're  sitting on the toilet having a heart attack... 
 
Amy   

411 
 
Yeah, exactly. Like, hit the head and they're like bleeding out. No one's come in and 
checked it. Yeah, like and they can't call anyone you know?  
 
Ashley Fisher   
No, I didn't see any toilet check signs either for staff members. 
 
Amy   
Oh, no, I didn't see any. So it was pretty clean though. So did you like that been in quite 
often, but it did. Well, it wasn't the busiest days. Yeah, because I'm surprised it's a Sunday. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I definitely expected it to busier. Did any barriers jumped out at you? 
 
Amy   
The main thing that I was like this isn't an issue for me but could be a major issue was how 
long it took to get to the toilets. And the fact that like you could only get from that far end of 
the museum and there was no signposts in the rest of the museum to where the that 
staircase was that you had to go down. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there any access tools that that you used? Either that the museum provided or that 
you had on you? 
 
Amy   
I don't know particularly, the main thing that I discovered was the fact that I wore my gloves 
all the way around. I liked you can pick up the things in the signs. I also use the railing and I 
wasn't sure, they didn't really... I mean i guess someone might have gone leave that there as 
an accessibility thing 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Could the museum have provided anything that would have been helpful? 
 
Amy   
I don't think necessarily providing anything just like changing a couple of things. I don't know 
like, the bannisters were a big one. Maybe not like crowding the spaces that you walk by the 
top and the bottom of the stairs, especially the second staircase from the Hall bit. And there 
are things like at the top of the stairs and there was also like windows which encouraged 
people to stop at the top of the stairs. I mean, we did Yeah. Which, You know, I felt it 
crowded in a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And because there were stairs going down on one at the doors- on one of the walls basically 
and then steps down another one. It felt almost... not dangerous, but certainly not very 
secure. Yeah, 
 
Amy   
yeah.  
 

412 
 
Ashley Fisher   
what should the museum design into the exhibition? 
 
Amy   
Um, I would have liked to know more about the trail that they did. Like maybe a sign or a 
leaflet about halfway through like, just a bit more because I really like the little gnome trail, it 
was really cute. I realise it's aimed at the kids but I would have enjoyed it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Not all things aimed at kids are only for kids. Okay, we're almost done. How did the staff 
make you feel? 
 
Amy   
Really welcomed, I think. Sometimes, when you talk to these people, they have a lot of 
enthusiasm, but they don't really feel like they care what you think about it. Do you know 
what I mean? So like blurting out information because they want to talk about it, because 
they want to. I felt like they genuinely were like, you  know, I'm gonna ask you a question. I 
give you a little bit more information and then.. especially the guy in the Blue Room. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Much more of a conversation than a lecture.  
 
Amy   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Did you feel you were treated differently than any of the other visitors? 
 
Amy   
No, I don't think so. Okay, oh, sorry. I'm just going to add to that, though, I almost would 
have liked to. Again, mainly referring to the fact that I went to sit down and that guy like just 
stayed on the other side of the room. Like I almost wish that they would have gone. Oh, do 
you want to sit? But of course they wouldn't have known to have done that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. 
 
Amy   
I almost wish that they... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
When we were in the family portrait room. I noticed you leaning on the chair. Very easy thing 
for her to go. Oh by the way. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
 

413 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It's just about noticing those things. Yeah. Just training people to notice. Yes. But anyway, 
do you think you would have been treated differently if you had a visible disability? 
 
Amy   
Yes. Well actually it's hard to know unless you go like... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I've been keeping an eye out when you go around for anyone that does have any physical 
disabilities. There was one time we had someone who I think he had Down syndrome. And 
they were like, not bending over backwards for them very, very accommodating. They were 
very patient, and they were explaining everything that he had questions for. And they were 
very, very invested in making sure that this person had a good experience. 
 
Amy   
See, that's pretty good. I really like that. Yes. So they should do that for everyone. Yeah, 
exactly. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And it's trying to find the right balance between giving everyone that really special individual 
attention and not overcrowding them when they wan... 
 
Amy   
see that's the thing. Like I feel like today was a day when they could have done that. Don't 
get me wrong. I didn't feel like I was like, getting brushed off or anything. I didn't feel like 
anyone was going above and beyond. Yeah, but today was definitely a day when they could 
have done that. Because there wasn't that many people about and I in quite a lot of rooms 
was the only person asking questions. And I think I was sort of being like, tell me about it like 
I want you to do this. Yeah, yeah, I'm not you know, you wouldn't be crowding me if you did 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. You were sending out very strong nonverbal signals that yes, please tell me about 
this.  
 
Amy   
Yeah, I want to know about it. Yeah. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I agree. Would you visit again? 
 
Amy   
Yeah, yeah. I'll bring my mum 
 
Ashley Fisher   
There you go. If you could tell the museum one more thing regarding accessibility of their 
site, what would it be? 
 
Amy   

414 
 
Move the Christmas decorations. And maybe prop the bathroom door open 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright.  
4.4. Follow-up Interview. 
We met at a café in York on 19 November, 2019 to conduct this interview. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So this is our last meeting. And as I was going back over our last Audio thing. I skipped a 
whole bunch of questions. So we didn't talk about specifically, some things with the blue 
drawing room. Go over those questions. So let's go over those real facts so thank you back 
to the blue drawing room where the displays clear and clean. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready. Well, yeah, I'm mentally logged in my brain is like a an example of 
something I think was done well, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
excellence and were there any things to read in there? 
 
Amy   
So if the guide wasn't there, I don't think I would have been interested in it. I think I want to 
call in and be like, yeah, the displays Cool, cool because there wasn't any signs or anything. 
Not that I noticed I didn't. I wouldn't. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Not to say ha, you're wrong, but there was a stand of this handheld. behind the tree though 
it's a I don't think it's the best placement. But yeah. I just find that quite interesting. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, if I didn't see people probably 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, exactly. 
 
Amy   
I did take a picture of a tree everything. 
 
No, it's totally fine. It proves the point that you really need to think about placement of 
everything. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
No, I just find that quite interesting. So I want to have all of the evidence just in case, 
something here. So where the stories and the tales of that particular room easy to 
understand. 
 

415 
 
Amy   
Did you tell me anything specifically about that room? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
We talked, I think you guys talked about the lighting and how it was meant. Oh, tell me more 
about that one. Yes.  
 
Amy   
Only half paying attention to what you said. Yeah. Well, I mean, he didn't really say that 
much about the room itself. I mentioned that it was already started to mention the new star 
and he said that it was supposed to be so it was like a party for because it was meditating 
space for like, the thing he specifically said actors or entertainers that we like to entertain. So 
yeah, I guess I gave him a bit of a backstory. But I know he did also mention about the 
seating is all about the knocking. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And he told me that without prompting 
anything either like I yeah, I didn't say anything first. So yeah, I guess you did. Okay. You 
told me. But again, that was because he was that I probably wouldn't, because I didn't see it 
was the overall noise level. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. 
 
Amy   
Yeah. I mean, it might be a bit quiet, but I was talking to someone so it wasn't that bad. I 
didn't notice it wasn't like, it wasn't like I feel like I have to keep my voice and didn't feel like 
you were disturbing anyone else. So having that conversation In some places you get it does 
feel like quiet. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How's the lighting? The lighting level?  
 
Amy   
I liked it. Yeah. I felt like you know, it's quite chill. Especially someone who was bosses it 
was lots of different smaller lights around the stars the light refracted my glasses, right It's 
really annoying. That's very fair. And possibly I should pay together bad your vertical 
involvement right here yeah I felt like it. I could have sat in that room and like read a book. I 
would really I mean, I may have needed a book like yeah, if I was in the corner, but it was 
quite relaxing I colleges. Yeah, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, were there enough places to sit and or rest in the intro? Yeah. Bye. 
 
Amy   
Yes, where I saw it was actually a window so and he didn't tell me not to. I think there was a 
question on it. So I think it was meant to be sound. But I don't think it was actually a seat. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. 
 

416 
 
Amy   
So might have been a little bit easier than some of the other rooms because it was at least 
like the sofas and things that sorry, obviously couldn't sell. Yeah, because they were facing 
goods. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah. Again, they made it very obvious when you couldn't sell the loft as obvious as to 
what you could do. Yeah. 
 
Amy   
But to be fair, I don't know if I was supposed to say oh, no, you didn't tell me not to. That 
doesn't mean that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So how are you? Are you feeling? Did you have any, any problems the next day or anything 
like that?  
 
Amy   
I did have a weird dream sign. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. So one of the things that you talked a bit about was the, the garland that was wrapped 
on the banister. 
 
Amy   
Yes, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Is that still something that impacted your visits?  
 
Amy   
Um, I don't think I had a massive impact. shut down the stairs with these I didn't like really 
aching legs afterwards. Oh yeah, I was out of breath but that doesn't happen and that 
combination says so maybe you did have some maybe I did but it is something that bothered 
me specifically because I was like such an obvious oversight. Yeah, it's like an obvious like 
we haven't either it hasn't been closed our minds and this will be an issue Sure. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And in that case it might be not so much that it's physically a package or visit but maybe it 
was one of those little seating niggles that you're like, you can really like Yeah. Yeah. 
 
Amy   
But she likes to be 
 

417 
 
Amy   
Yeah, I like the oddities in the house and moving pointed out to me. But I just appreciate that 
like quite often we get to do things where they'll be a little plot, I call it or like a little like label 
on display. And then the other side of the room or on request is like a large castle. But I don't 
need a large tech tomorrow. I just need one that I can take so I don't have to stand there. I 
don't have to punch over a sign right. I don't have to like and also felt like an anxiety. I don't 
want to stand in front of the sign. Read it. Yeah. I feel like I felt like brain fog that day or 
whatever it might give me a little bit longer to absorb the information. I don't want to be 
standing there taking the time. Other people might be trying to read it yet. Or my was Yeah. 
But the sign was there and it wasn't like it was just what that was like one top of the other 
and you can pick up on a new Yeah. Away from anybody else. Yeah. Yeah. And that wasn't 
my popsicle request or like go somewhere else to buy me just get back to me if I want if you 
do have to request them Do you tend to Are you okay? I don't I still read the big I'm like I'm 
not gonna I'm not gonna find out what? Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Which disability of yours Do you think impacted the visit the most? like 
 
Amy   
okay, like pain and fatigue. But again is fatigue which which yeah the fatigue but yeah the 
ability to like I don't know like stand up in the middle like towards getting a win over Welcome 
to t he woman in the Porsche struggle to concentrate. Yeah. But she got me on a pretty 
good day. So  
 
Ashley Fisher   
that was one of my other questions. If we had gone on a bad day, how do you think it would 
have been different? 
 
Amy   
If we go on like a moderate to bad day, I wouldn't have spoken to any of the people. That's 
okay. I probably would have done the same, which I do with a lot of people when I go people 
to museums is I go to room. I want to appreciate it. But I will sit down and watch the other 
person. Got it? I'll say something like, I'm just gonna wait here. Tell me your favourite thing. 
You've seen someone I'll go see that or something like that? Because I've had, I don't know. 
wander around aimlessly, especially when it's just a bunch of cabinets. I'm like I this is 
overwhelming. I take some time. Yes, I'm on a really good I was just gonna say because 
we've already talked, we've already scheduled you're okay with it, I just like I'm going 
because I want to enjoy it, if going is going to cost me a lot of stress because I have to do a 
lot of things. Because once I go by day once given that there's nothing else I can do. And 
which means that I have to know that I can schedule a whole day off from work. Or like what 
I'm doing particularly badly I have to like do like two days so that I have to have the whole 
day beforehand to rest. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure, yeah. And you said you would like you were likely to visit the museum. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

418 
 
Did this visit reminds you of any other museums you visited and good or bad? 
 
Amy   
nothing's coming to mind okay. It is quite similar to a lot of places I've been but I call 
 
Ashley Fisher   
that's fine. 
 
Amy   
Yeah, it wasn't like it wasn't like a standout like this is completely different to anything I've 
ever seen. Yeah, I'm fairly Yeah. Standard National Trust experience like this a strong new 
sort of house for my hero. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
Amy   
I mean, it's similar to be mission some ways whether it's just like a task. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Actually. I'm thinking back on your best experience going to museums. Are there any stellar 
museum experiences that stand out in your head? 
 
Amy   
Yes, but not for this reason. That's okay. I want to hear him anyway. Good. I think about this 
all the time, the museum and Dublin, okay, whether you want to write about this, the way 
that they display the human remains in the museum is absolutely fantastic. And those like I 
did, and maybe realize how bad everybody else was doing. The way I want you were 
discussion. So, the good news is, they have this this room that was sort of talking about this 
like, just general like history, like the main typically dedicated thing, but then even the rooms 
there was like these, almost like, these very like, circular We came on the ground, there will 
be signs telling you like, this is what's in here. Absolutely information about them. And then 
you go in, and then there will be the court flight. Yeah, no signage, nothing. Just that. And 
then as you left there be more information. And I really, really like that because you will want 
where you don't get was the last time. Yeah. And it meant that they could keep the waters of 
a controlled climate. Yeah, they could limit the amount of people walking passive and you 
can also like, stop. And it wasn't the word like labelled like an accident. The information was 
there, but it was before and after. It wasn't like in a cabinet with a label. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think there are different expectations put on paying versus non paid 
 
Amy   
I don't think this If I was paying to get into a museum, I don't want it to be like, two selfish 
reasons. Right? Like, for me the main expectation is like the time that it's going to be. Okay. 
So you got something Yeah. Like if I paid to get in I wanted it to be was the hours that I 
spent finding that money? Yeah, you know what I mean? So like, this is just like if I if I say 
you six pounds, and it's six pounds again to me to like, without thinking about it. I want it to 
take at least our God. Like, I think it'd be Roman Baths museum. It's like to quit to get in. I 

419 
 
would happily pay to quit for that museum. Hey for quit for that no Sam quit to quit is it feels 
right yeah, that means Yeah, exactly. Because it's going to take you 15 minutes to get 
around it.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
So my last question is a personal question, but do you consider yourself disabled? I know, I 
know, this is a big question.  
 
Amy   
It depends on people that I sent the email I was like, Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it didn't even like, 
I didn't even question like, maybe I'm not disabled. In some situation. I'm like, yeah, 
according to the government, because I got to say, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I 
don't have a proper diagnosis. Okay, I did have a proper diagnosis. I'm saying that. It's 
almost like whenever I say Do you consider yourself be disabled, I always pick the defined. 
Like it also depends on the day to save, like in in, you know, in the community forgot what I 
was trying to say well in the sense of like, I feel like something is disabled. Okay, as well as 
like an objective to describe me as a Fisher. However other days, I'm like I realized that this 
thing exists and still exists. Now. Yeah. Well, Joe be to say that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. So would you consider yourself a disabled person or a person with a disability which 
would you identify 
 
Amy   
But only because I feel like I feel like that was just a little time. I don't feel like I'm being 
disabled fighters. well. She was disabled person because she feels like she is like for me, 
because I'm gay. I consider that as part of my identity. Yeah. And like, I know, there's the 
whole like, Oh, I don't want people to just see me, but I want people to see me. 
4.5. Follow-up Email. 
I asked Amy for her experience with sunflower lanyards. Her email follows. 
 
I do have a sunflower lanyard and I do wear it occasionally however my feelings about it 
have changed since the pandemic. Before the pandemic, I would wear it pretty much all the 
time. This was because it was a way of making my disability visible which has a number of 
advantages. It means people may be more accommodating, they may be more attentive to 
your needs and less likely to dismiss a request and members of the general public may do 
things such as give up a seat for you or allow you extra room. However, I have to admit that I 
didn't see many actual changes day-to-day. I would make sure to wear it in certain settings 
such as on a bus or train, as the staff are supposed to be trained to recognize it but I do not 
feel like it changed how I was treated. Most of the time people are accommodating and 
friendly but with or without a lanyard I would have to disclose a disability before I was able to 
get special accommodations. 
 
However, I feel differently about it post-pandemic. During the pandemic, it became common 
knowledge that some people would not be able to wear a mask due to a hidden disability. As 
a way of supporting these people, it was shared on social media that wearing a sunflower 
lanyard may be a way of indicating to someone that you have a hidden disability. 
Unfortunate somewhere along the way this got confused and the message that was passed 
on to the general public was that if you wear a sunflower lanyard you do not have to wear a 

420 
 
mask. This resulted in two things, a lot of people suddenly knew what the sunflower lanyard 
was and therefore it wasn't a subtle indicator to trained staff anymore, and it also resulted in 
many people abusing this system because they didn't want to wear a mask and falsely 
believing a sunflower lanyard would allow them to get away with this. Suddenly, wearing a 
sunflower lanyard became political. I would often wear a sunflower lanyard specifically on 
days I knew I would also be wearing a mask, almost to make a point about how not all 
people with hidden disabilities have mask exemptions. Since then the lanyard has just 
become too loaded for me, it doesn't serve its original function anymore. I still own one and 
occasionally wear it but not as much as I used to. I try and make my disability more visible in 
other ways such as wearing a badge, and I find that more direct and effective than the 
sunflower lanyard. 
 
Unfortunately, I think this is a case of a good thing being taken over by politics and it results 
in the meaning being lost. Part of me feels like I should continue to wear it and encourage 
others to do so as a form of reclaiming, but as the general public doesn't seem to be willing 
to have the conversation about what they are actually for it seems it wouldn't be very useful. 
They have also become very recognisable which means they, in part, no longer serve their 
original purpose of being discreet and likely will not again, at least not in the near future as 
they remain in the public consciousness. 
5. Ellie. 
Ellie is a woman with anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, depression, and fibromyalgia. 
5.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met Ellie at her home to conduct this interview on 15 November, 2019. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Just making sure. All right. So, as I mentioned before, we'll have a couple different meetings. 
So we'll have one now as talking about a pre visit stuff and then we're going to go to our 
museum and your case, in this case, at least is going to be treasurer's house, and I have a 
basic outline for how for what we'll do there. But by and large, I want you to lead the visit. 
Because I want to understand how your disability affects your enjoyment of museums and 
things like that. After the museum visit, we'll go straight to a café or a pub or something and 
have a chat about the experience. And then sometime hopefully next week, we'll have our 
last meeting and talk about the museum visit again, but also other museums you visited and 
how they compare. That's right. Yeah. Excellent. So I have a few questions for you. First and 
foremost, you mentioned that you have fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression. And was there 
something else? Yeah, 
 
Ellie   
chronic vestibular migraine. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Yes, migraines that was there. Alright. So, I've done a little research on all of them, 
but go ahead. Tell me what they are because you're the expert on them. You're the one that 
has lived experience. Okay. 
 
Ellie   

421 
 
So I'll start with the migraine, because that's one of the longest so that affects me and I have 
Like quite serious headaches, but also with a particular kind I get I struggle a lot with 
dizziness because it affects my inner ear as well so things like I got lots of symptoms to get 
with motion sickness so a lot of knowledge a lot of dizziness sometimes collapsing okay with 
that visual problems as well and then the Fibromyalgia is constant widespread pain, 
particularly my joints so for me it tends to tends to be worse in my knees so walking a walk 
with a with a stick, majority of the time and fatigue and brain fog so even when quite often 
even like simple tasks are really difficult because I just can't compute what I actually need to 
be doing? Yeah, I think those are the those are the main things for that. And then the sort of 
anxiety and depression sort of go hand in hand. In that I get very stressed out very easily. 
And it's difficult to... just trying to think how to phrase this. It stopped me from doing things 
quite a lot in terms of like, trying to get the momentum up to do things. Yes. So it's, it's quite 
draining in that way in. Even just like, simple stuff like doing washing up, it feels like kind of 
like a mental battle to actually get to the point of being able to do it. Yeah, that's so that's sort 
of a constant background thing, which is Yeah, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I am on medication for anxiety, depression and OCD. And I also have iron deficiency 
anaemia. So I very much understand brain fog and the whole it takes a lot to do simple task 
if I brush my teeth and shower in the same day. That's a good day for me. Yes. So I really 
very much understand that battle. Excellent. And these are all conditions that you're born 
with. Is that correct? They just sort of highlight at different parts of your age in life. 
 
Ellie   
The fibro is a bit of a weird one because I've been told that it quite often starts with like, they 
described as a traumatic event, which for me was starting uni. Okay, so that was pretty 
much first time in first year. I suddenly got like, knocked back by that and like, okay, didn't So 
I couldn't get out of bed for days on end. Is this just what being a student is like and then 
realize that it's really not but the migraines been like pretty much as long as I can remember. 
Okay. And same with the same of the mental health I think but again aggravated by uni. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. Um Yeah, so that's wonderful. Um, how do these things sort of impact your day to 
day lives? life? Yeah. 
 
Ellie   
So with just sort of on a very simple basis, I always have to carry a lot of stuff with me 
because I have, I'm on several different types of medication that I have with me at all times. 
And then I have to have water with me and I have to have my walking stick So my films have 
to be like lugging a tote bag around with all yeah like accessories and yeah but yeah just like 
simple day to day tasks like going to the shop like going having lectures I have to allot a lot 
more time because it's just physically exhausting for me and quite often I get back and I just 
have to like get straight into bed because it just takes up so much like.. Do you know the 
spoons theory.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes yes yes it yes  
 
Ellie   
it takes up all my spoons yeah so. So there's that and then the migraine makes it quite 
difficult working with computers and things and I have a lot of external triggers like right like 

422 
 
some lights in shops, like I can't go into certain shops because it's Just an immediate 
migraine trigger Like that was, that was so severe when I was younger that I'd like to be 
taken out of school. Wow. Okay, and so that was Yeah, so that's quite a problem when I 
have to kind of plot where I go according, like, you know can I tolerate x y Zed at the 
moment. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What kind of lights Do you know? 
 
Ellie   
It tends to be like, fluorescent strip lighting isn't great. But also there are some shops and I 
don't know if it's to do with a type of bulb, but there's like a low level flickering that Yeah, 
yeah. Yeah. And yeah, and it's something that I don't know if other people are as aware of it, 
or if they can just kind of like shrug it off. But I'm like, incredibly sensitive to it to the point 
where I'll go into a shop and then immediately there I'm just kinda Yeah. Yeah. 
 
- 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Wonderful, right. That's our practice. They're wonderful. Seem alright thinking aloud. Thank 
you. Wonderful. So now I have some questions about how you prepare for a trip. So do you 
use websites? How do you find out about a place that you're going to? 
 
Ellie   
normally I would if I'm not looking for like a specific Museum, I would just kind of be like, you 
know what, what is there to do in this area? And see like what museums are have a quick 
look around the website and that sorry. Yeah, have a quick look on their website and then 
just things like opening hours if there are any, like specific exhibitions on at the minute or 
event because I tend Well, a lot of the museum events, certainly where I am tend to be quite 
like child oriented ones so I might like see when the events are on so I might be able to 
avoid them so they're not as busy Yeah. Cuz it can be quite intense, especially if it's like a 
small museum. Yeah. Yeah, have a quick look about, like, how to get there. And just try and 
get a general impression. Like, from the website of what like what the feel of the museum's 
going to be like. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. And that's all on the museum's website. Yes. And what information do you need? 
So obviously hours, what's going on how to get there feel of the museum? Is there any other 
information that you're looking for  
 
Ellie   
cost  
 
Ashley Fisher   
costs? Yes. Excellent. And do you use any accessibility tools like screen readers or colour 
overlays or anything like that? 
 
Ellie   

423 
 
I do have a screen reader. I tend to use it more on like actual documents as opposed to 
websites because it does not respond very well to website 
 
Ashley Fisher   
that's the websites fault. Yeah. 
 
Ellie   
Tell ya I tend to I do I do try to use it but I might have to give up quite quickly with a lot of 
them because it's just easier to risk the like migraine or just have a quick look rather than 
wait for my screen reader to battle through the website. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. And when you as you're getting ready, what sort of equipment or aids do you do 
you bring with you? You mentioned medication earlier. Yeah. 
 
Ellie   
So I will always have my painkillers, anti nausea medication with me. And I have to take my 
water as well because I've legal to set them with and I will take my walking stick as well. I've 
been using it or if it's like a really good day I'll just like, take it with me. Yeah. Yeah, I think I 
think that's it for equipment that I take with me, okay? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Are there any eventualities that you plan for 
 
Ellie   
and I would usually take some kind of snack with me as well because particularly when I 
have a like migraine attack or a fibro flare up, I tend to like need food quite quickly. So I'll try 
and have something sort of sugary with me in terms of like if I do have an attack whilst I'm 
out, there's not really that much I can do about it aside from like, If I need to, like text 
somebody so I'll just make sure my phones close to hand. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right, and how much time does it normally take you to get everything ready? I'm 
 
Ellie   
probably only about 5-10 minutes because I tend to keep I keep my medication in my bag 
and I keep my stake in the same place. So it's, it's pretty much just go and collect everything 
 
Ashley Fisher   
pretty much organized ahead of time. And yeah, one of those daily routines that 
 
Ellie   
Yeah, cuz I mean, because I always have to take these things out with me when I go out 
regularly. So it's not Yeah, museum specific. Right. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. So, pardon me, for the visit itself. We're just going to be doing what we've been 
calling a semi structured visit, which means that by and large will follow Your lead will go 

424 
 
where you want to go in the museum spend as much time as you like in them, whatever you 
want to do, I want this to be as normal a visit for you as possible. And that being said, there 
are a few points that I want to make sure we hit during our visit. Very basic points. They are 
visiting a particular exhibition. For treasures house, it's the sitting room, which I will make 
sure we get they're asking a staff member for help purchasing a small item from the shop, I 
have five pounds in cash, so you don't need to worry about paying for it. And visiting the 
toilets. Very, very simple things that most people do. Every single visit they do anyway, it's 
just so I have points of actual comparison between everybody. And then like I said after the 
museum or go to a nearby pub or something, have a drink or snack and do a bit of a debrief 
and a few questions and I want to do a visit audit with you which I sent. I believe I sent you 
already. Yeah. Basically we'll just go through a checklist and see how the museum's doing in 
certain areas like noise and light levels how easy things were to Read things like that. So 
does that make sense? Yeah, sounds excellent. And the visit itself can last 20 minutes if you 
want it to. It doesn't have to be, you know, hours and hours and hours. So don't feel 
pressured to stay for a really long time. It's just a normal visit for you. So all right, let me stop 
this. 
5.2. Site Visit. 
Our visit to Treasurer’s House took place on the same day. The audio was recorded, but 
there was nothing relevant to transcribe. 
5.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
After our site visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct this interview, still on the same 
day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, we've gone through that. Now we're going to do our visit audit while we're waiting for 
our hot chocolate. Yes. So was it easy? So we went from your place to the museum by 
walking. So how well do you think those were? Things were signposted. And 
 
Ellie   
it's a bit hard for me to tell you this one because I walk past a sign for it all the time. So I 
have a background knowledge of where it was. Yeah. After we passed that like initial sign, it 
was easy to find. If I was coming from a centre view without any prior knowledge. I'm not 
sure I would have found it. I don't know that there's any I've never seen anything like to 
green metal signs that they have for like Barley Hall and things. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right and Was it easy to get from point A to point B? 
 
Ellie   
Yes 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so was it easy to find the museum from the street?  
 
Ellie   
Yeah. 
 

425 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was it easy to find the entrance. 
 
Ellie   
Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
With the layout of the museum, easy to understand. 
 
Ellie   
Not really. I could have done that some more guidance as to if there was a particular 
direction that I can A couple of times especially when I went up the staircase in the grand 
hall where I got to the top they didn't know what to go to court Oh stretching off and I like 
wasn't sure which way to go even though all of them like led to the café it wasn't very clear 
from like the top of the stairs right? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yep. Excellent. And there was another group there. That's a bit confused as well. Yeah. So 
and the shop was the signage easy to understand.  
 
Ellie   
No. With the sign saying please be upstairs next. Yeah, set of stairs, but they weren't the 
stairs that you need to go to pay. Yeah. Which was quite confusing. And also wasn't a way 
of like, getting someone's attention. You're waiting there, which wasn't great. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, was there enough space to move about? 
 
Ellie   
Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And was it easy to navigate the shop  
 
Ellie   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Wonderful. Thank you. so was it easy to navigate shop them.  
 
Ellie   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were the toilets easy to find? 
 

426 
 
Ellie   
Fairly 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was the toilet clean? 
 
Ellie   
I could have been better. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And was the floor clean?  
 
Ellie   
Again could have been better. Also, weirdly, it took me like five minutes to find the light 
switch.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Oh really?  
 
Ellie   
Yeah, it's one of the things. It was a cord. But for some reason when I went back, it's 
because it's dark immediately when you go I don't know if that's just me being unobservant. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I honestly haven't used their toilets yet. So I'm getting all this second hand experience. I'm 
waiting until we've done all the participants and then I'll go and see them. All right, the staff 
did the team members treat you any differently than another visitor? 
 
Ellie   
I don't think so 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was the team member able to offer appropriate help when.. You talked to the woman up in 
the king's room about the ... 
 
Ellie   
Yeah, I think although the all the room guides were really helpful. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Did you feel welcomed in the museum? 
 
Ellie   
Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Now thinking about the exhibits where the displays clear? 

427 
 
 
Ellie   
um, I think once I got like, what's, what's out what they're doing in terms of like three different 
stories and stuff. It made sense. But it wasn't immediately clear it would have been maybe 
nice that been like a board saying like colour coded say all the green boards are about this. 
The purple ones are about this 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were the fonts easy to read.  
 
Ellie   
Yes.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was the colour contrast good or appropriate?  
 
Ellie   
Yeah. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
How was the volume for the videos? 
 
Ellie   
On the one in the Roman bit- really loud really loud. I had to take the headphones off 
because it 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I was wondering about that. Yeah. 
 
Ellie   
The only other one was music. Yeah, I was just gonna say, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah. Okay. Were the stories and Tales of the experience, easy to read and understand. 
 
Ellie   
What do you define story or tale, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I think in the way that they present the information, the stories and the narratives based on 
the handheld panels. 
 
Ellie   
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

428 
 
Right. How was the overall noise level? 
 
Ellie   
It was fine. It was a little bit noisy initially in the first room, that we went into was the one. But 
I think it's just a big group of people. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It was remarkably busy today, right? Yeah. I've never seen that many people in  the 
treasurer's house, so were some places too loud.  
 
Ellie   
The first [room] yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
were some places to quiet 
 
Ellie   
I don't. I've never thought a place in a museum was too quiet 
 
Ashley Fisher   
that was a very common response. How's the lighting level? 
 
Ellie   
Not good. That was probably the thing I struggled with most just because it changed so 
much. Right? And I understand obviously like flux levels and I need to get preserve textiles 
and things. So I understand that, but I just wish they had done it more consistently because 
it was quite jarring going from like natural light to artificial light to like, mixture. Yeah, and I 
like the blue drawing room was a real struggle 
 
Ashley Fisher   
going off that were some places to light. 
 
Ellie   
But yeah, that was that was too bright. It made me feel ill. Okay, just, I think just the intensity 
of it and everything else was so dark. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And was there any place that was too dark? 
 
Ellie   
weirdly, it was both 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there enough places to sit and or rest 
 
Ellie   

429 
 
not in the downstairs? The upstairs was fine there were like quite a few different areas but I 
could really have done on the bench maybe in the Great Hall or something 
 
Ashley Fisher   
now thinking about the blue drawing room where the displays clear and clean 
 
Ellie   
I think they were they would have been clear if they've been enough like to see them. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, and where the fonts easy to read?  
 
Ellie   
Yes  
 
Ashley Fisher   
and was the colour contrast 
 
Ellie   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
The stories and tales of that exhibition in that room is easy to read and understand.  
 
Ellie   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And how was the overall noise level? 
 
Ellie   
Um, yeah, I think noise level was fine. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And the lighting level? 
 
Ellie   
Very bad. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. And were there enough places to sit? 
 
Ellie   
No, I don't think there was anywhere to sit. 
 

430 
 
Unknown Speaker   
Up to the audio? Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Physically How are you feeling after that? 
 
Ellie   
I'm feeling quite achy. And the thing because in museums like that, it's a lot of like, short 
walk then stand short walk then stand It puts quite a lot of pressure on my joints. Yeah. So 
by the end of it, I'm definitely ready to sit down for sure. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there any rooms in particular that were difficult for your migraines or that you thought 
might have been a trigger for them? 
 
Ellie   
Blue drawing room again 
 
Ashley Fisher   
and again, that was the intensity 
 
Ellie   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So what was one good thing about the museum in general? 
 
Ellie   
I really liked the, the way they approached it because it is quite a difficult place to curate 
because you're trying to, like tell the stories of the objects but also, like weird way they've 
been put together. Yeah. And of the house itself. So I like that they have this like multi strand 
narrative going on. And I like that you could kind of because of the format of it, you can kind 
of pick and choose how much you wanted to, might engage with it. As opposed to having 
like big obtrusive signboards everywhere. It was quite nice to just be able to say, right, I want 
to read about this in this room. And that's it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, and one bad thing about the museum in general. 
 
Ellie   
The main thing that stands out is just the lighting.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. This is really interesting because every single person across all the sites and all 
disabilities, single that lighting as like the biggest thing, and that's something I really didn't 
expect. So one good thing related to accessibility about the museum 
 

431 
 
Ellie   
I'm not sure like accessibility specific. I like that- again, I don't know if they did this like 
intentionally but I liked that room upstairs. That was like a sort of like a quieter space. The 
little exhibition room. Sure. That felt like a nice, nice place to like decompress. I noticed as 
well, I had some like colouring in stuff was also probably a good place to play with children. 
Like, right. Sorry, I can't tell what I'm trying to say 
 
Ashley Fisher   
like, um, like a quiet room or a, like a sensory room or Yeah, 
 
Ellie   
yeah, I know you're trying to say but yeah, I don't know. I don't know how much of that was 
intentional or how much was just we have an exhibition space. But I'm like, I think it is a 
good a good space for that. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And one bad thing related to accessibility. 
 
Ellie   
I'm gonna go a little bit off script here and not say the light. Okay. It's a decoration on the 
bannisters Sure. It's just not it's not feasible and it does look really nice, but it's just not 
Yeah, it just doesn't work. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
But that there should be some compromise. has helped people upstairs. 
 
Ellie   
Yeah, I mean, even if you don't have what accessibility issues, it's just kind of a natural. You 
can go to grab a banister, you just get like a battery pack in your hand. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Does anyone any barriers jump out at you? Not necessarily related, just to your disability or 
just to you. 
 
Ellie   
I don't know what the options would be for a visually impaired person. Okay, cuz we went 
when we went anyways, we weren't offered an audio guide or anything. Yeah. So I don't 
know. Aside from that, like one video in the cellar. It seemed like there was basically one 
way of the information being presented and if that way didn't work for you then you were 
kinda stuck. And I think the other thing is just sort of, again, physical accessibility and I'm 
able to climb stairs and things on good days, but obviously that's a limit to how much you 
can do about that in a building. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there any access tools you felt that they provided that you thought were helpful? 
 
Ellie   
I don't think they provided any access tools 

432 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
could there have been anything 
 
Ellie   
I would say some kind of audio element would be useful. Yeah, I think that's probably that's 
all I can think of that you could do really without like most structural changes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What should museum design into these exhibitions from the beginning, like font choice, 
colour schemes, multi sensory. 
 
Ellie   
I think multi sensory really important. I think getting a good balance between text and image I 
think they did it mostly on their information boards, but there was some of them that were 
like really text heavy. And it'd be nice to just make sure there's like a balance, so it's not too 
overwhelming. And the think, as well, maybe thinking about how people like move around 
the museum and think about maybe giving a bit more guidance about like, what you should 
go because again, I didn't really realize until we're coming back through that there was 
another staircase in the hall. Because, obviously, the hangings were in the way. Yeah, so 
that wasn't, it would have been nice to have maybe a little sign saying further galleries up 
here or something. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, did you bring or did you use anything that you personally supplied? So you brought 
you used your walking stick 
 
Ellie   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, and how did the staff make you feel?  
 
Ellie   
Um.. The room guides were really nice and welcoming. And so were the people on the like, 
as you went in like the front desk. The person in the shop made me feel like a bit of a 
nuisance. And I understand it's difficult going between like being in the café and being in the 
gift shop, but yeah, just seemed quite impatient. And I felt like I was See I was a bit of an 
inconvenience.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Do you feel you were treated any differently than other visitors? 
 
Ellie   
I don't think so 
 
Ashley Fisher   
[cleaned up a bit of a spill] 

433 
 
 
Let's go back to them. Did you feel you were treated differently than any other visitor?  
 
Ellie   
No 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think you would have been treated differently if your disability was more visible? 
 
Ellie   
I'm not sure, based on the kind of interaction that I was having, because there was sort of 
more with the room guides and just learning about the room. Yeah, I'm not sure whether I 
would have been treated any differently. And that but possibly at the maybe the ticket desk, I 
might have been asked if I needed any help, or anything along those lines. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay would you visit again? 
 
Ellie   
I think so. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
It's okay to say no 
 
Ellie   
I think I would visit again when I was less brain foggy and able to take in the information 
boards a bit more 
 
Ashley Fisher   
if you could tell the museum one thing regarding accessibility of their site, what would it be? 
 
Ellie   
It would be taught something about the lighting. Yeah. Because it does make a really big 
difference and if especially from what you're saying if people with other disabilities as well 
upbringing off as well, it's quite possibly just a universal issue yeah needs addressing. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It really does and it's always for different reasons. And one was because it interfered with 
their dyslexia so it's very difficult for them to be able to read in general and having little lights 
only exacerbated it. Another was an older person. So they I don't think that they had any 
visual difficulties, but they just had old tired eyes. Yeah. 
 
Ellie   
You know? Yeah. And especially with the amount that you read when you read in a 
museum, without really realizing it. Yeah. It can. It can get tiring very quickly. 
 

434 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Excellent. Alright, that's all I have for this one. Great. Okay. So, do you 
want to set the date for our next meeting? No, no, I'll do it now. And then we have it set. Yes. 
5.4. Follow-up Interview. 
We met at a café in York on 21 November, 2019 to conduct this interview. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How are you doing?  
 
Ellie   
I'm doing okay. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, it's been a bit of a tiring week.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
But yeah, this has been very cold, which hasn't been hoping  
 
Ellie   
my phone dropped down to zero for the first time. Oh, my goodness. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. Super not fun. How did you feel the next day? 
 
Ellie   
And it really took it out with me that yesterday I was quite surprised. So I'm sort of normally if 
it's like a really big stately home, kind of like Castle Howard. Yeah. Kind of thing I expect to 
feel kind of drained afterwards, but because it was like a smaller museum. I didn't think it 
would have as much of an impact but I went to meet my, my sister for coffee afterwards. 
Yeah. And then I went home and just sort of crashed for a couple of hours like yeah, just by 
full on. Had to go for a nap. Yep. So, so yeah, it was it was physically quite demanding. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. We will keep that in mind for our other trips. Okay, um, when we were talking last time 
lighting was big issue. Yeah. Still feel that way? 
 
Ellie   
Yeah, I think so. It's still a something that when I sort of think back to the visit, it's quite a 
prominent issue that was brought to mind. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think the lighting or the lack of seating was more of a more of a problem for you? 
 
Ellie   
That's a difficult one. Umm.. I think probably the it's, it's difficult because the light-  because 
it's sort of for two different conditions. Exactly. Yeah. I think probably the, the lighting 
because it's more of a thing that is going to have a long lasting impact. Because it's a 
migraine trigger, it's something that I might not necessarily realise. Sure at the time because 
it's kind of like an ambient issue. Yeah. If it was getting to a point where I was like, I can't sit 

435 
 
up anymore. I know that I could go and sit in the café or something. Yeah, the lighting is a bit 
harder to escape. Yeah. Thank you. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thank you. Okay. So then the lighting would have had the biggest impact?  
 
Ellie   
I think so. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Which of your various disabilities do you think had the biggest impact on the visit? 
 
Ellie   
 I think probably the fibro, okay. Because that was just in terms of the physical aspect of like 
getting up and down stairs. And yeah, I find the kind of, I guess the museum walking pattern 
that you do like walk a little bit and stop and read a bit and walk a little, but weirdly seems to 
be like harder to deal with all it has more of an impact on how I feel. Yeah. And so even if, 
like, if I was walking solidly for like 20 minutes or something, it wouldn't have as big an 
impact of if I was like more than five minutes stopping for 10 which is a strange thing, but yet 
I just noticed 
 
Ashley Fisher   
that I had someone mentioned that they have to go, the rate that they go, they can't go 
faster. They can't go slow because it can be physically painful for them, right. Is it something 
like that? 
 
Ellie   
Yeah, it's I think I think it's kind of the movement you get used to used to like constant 
movement and you can kind of account for that. Whereas when you stop paying... I guess 
you like shifting weight and stuff without necessarily realising it. And then that can have I 
certainly feel as more of an impact in my like in my hips and knees after like museum visit 
then than regular walking. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Interesting. Okay. And you really liked the handheld panels?  
 
Ellie   
Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I've got hot chocolate. 
 
Ellie   
Yes, I liked the I like the handheld panels. I think just size wise they were just that slightly 
awkward size that were slightly bigger than a A4 which I think it's just because you know, 
you used to holding something that's A4, it just felt a little bit awkward. Yeah. But in terms of 
like the design and the intent behind that. I really like them. 
 

436 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How about the weight to them? 
 
Ellie   
Surprisingly heavy. Again, I don't know if it's the kind of organisation size that made that feel 
more prominent. But yeah, they felt they felt weirdly heavy for what they were. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay. And the decorations on the Banister?  
 
Ellie   
Yes, yeah. Yeah, just an issue. I mean, it's not completely like you could grab on to the 
decorations on the banister don't know how tightly that tied on and that could be a whole 
other thing. Yeah. So yeah, so that's that's definitely an issue. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you... when you're doing research, do you check out accessibility guides or an 
accessibility page on their website?  
 
Ellie   
Um... I don't tend to know. And it's probably something that I should start doing. But I tend to 
kind of try to get an idea just from generally the website of what kind of a space is. OK, if it's 
something that I'm going to have, like significant issues with if, if it's like a really big site, but I 
suppose when I'm looking at things like entry fees and stuff, it normally comes up with a 
thing saying like, you know, accessible for wheelchair users on which I generally take as 
kind of a, you know, there should be ways around. Yeah, but I very rarely go specifically 
looking for accessibility information.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. And I believe that you said you would visit again.  
 
Ellie   
Yes.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Still believe that? 
 
Ellie   
Yeah, I think so. The I've been thinking a lot actually about the tapestry room. Hmm that's 
kind of a place that stayed with me the most and I think I'd maybe like to go back and and 
have another look round and yeah and explore a bit more maybe – not at Christmas, when 
they don't have the kind of the lights and the decorations and things up. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Did treasurer's house remind you of any other museums That you visited either good ways 
or bad ways or 
 
Ellie   

437 
 
and it reminds me a little bit of Temple Newsom which I went to a couple of months ago. And 
I don't know if it's just because of, I think possibly because of the kind of mixture of different 
periods in there. because Temple Newsom, some like it's got some like Tudor rooms, and 
then some later rooms in it. And the kind of change between time periods reminded me 
about. Yeah, and then I guess just sort of the general like, stately home experience. Yeah. It 
come sort of, like some of them can kind of merge into each other about 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, you need to have something a bit unique to your site in order for it to really stand out if 
we're taking this trip on a bad day for your disability, whichever one you want to choose, 
would that have changed anything? 
 
Ellie   
I think it might have changed whether I went upstairs or not. Okay. I might have just stayed 
unexplored the ground floor instead.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
And this would have been during a fibro  
 
Ellie   
Yes during a fibro flare and then if I'd been if I've been having a bad migraine, I just wouldn't 
have gone into the blue drawing room room. Yeah. Just sort of the minute I saw those lights, 
I would just have gone somewhere else. Yeah. And yeah, depending on sort of how anxious 
I was feeling on the day as well might have altered how I interacted with the room guides.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay.  
 
Ellie   
Cuz I'm.. would be sort of more inclined hang back and just and not not approach or ask 
questions. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How are you feeling in anxiety-wise on that day? And 
 
Ellie   
I was I wasn't too bad that day. I feel just a little bit like, just generally nervous about about 
the thing. But yeah, it was sort of a 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sort of the normal expectation of nervousness. Yeah, 
 
Ellie   
you know, rather than a specific like anxiety kind of feeling. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
This question, I may ask you a few times since we're doing this a couple times. Okay. Do 
you consider yourself disabled?  

438 
 
 
Ellie   
I do. It's taken quite a long time to get to the point where I consider myself today but I do. 
Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you prefer a being a... do you prefer identifying as a disabled person or a person with a 
disability 
 
Ellie   
Um, I don't really have a strong feeling either way. If I'm, if I'm talking about myself, I 
suppose I generally tend to say, you know, as someone with a disability rather than as a 
disabled person, but it's not something that I've really thought about that much. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
In a lot of the disability literature, there's lots and lots of debate as to whether we should be 
doing that.  
 
Ellie   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And right now, the official stance is we should be going with disabled person, but every 
single participant I've asked has said, person with a disability. And I think there's a lot more 
nuance that needs to be invited into this. I find it really interesting. And it's, oh, it's been quite 
unequivocal too they're like, no, definitely a person with a disability. You're the first person 
that's given any kind of 'haven't really, really thought about it,' but so I find it really 
interesting. Yeah. And 
 
Ellie   
yes, I think it's such a personal thing. I never thought the mandated like, this is the this is the 
official way that people should be referred to but it's so personal. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It really is. And you should absolutely follow what the person wants to identify as. Absolutely. 
It's just been a since I'm writing about disability, yeah. My gut instinct had been person with 
disabilities for my participants. And so that's what I had been writing and one of my thesis 
advisory panel members said, well, you shouldn't really be saying disabled person because 
that's, you know, the government stance that you're supposed to do officially and it just still 
didn't sit right. So I'm very glad that I have this so I can keep calling you guys people with 
disability. Yes. That's clearly what you prefer. Yeah. So that's all my questions. Okay. Do 
you have any questions? Or anything you just want to chat about 
 
Ellie   
not not specifically about the the treasurer's house I think except I suppose. I don't know if 
the if you can go into this on but like, if you've got much of an impression of like, whether the 
National Trust we're trying to do much in terms of improving accessibility, 
 

439 
 
Ashley Fisher   
so I can actually answer that question. treasurers house specifically has been very 
interested in helping my research because they can't do a whole lot physically to the place 
which is fine. I understand that. But they want to improve accessibility in whatever other way 
that they can. Because their head of volunteers I believe it is. Her name is Trish. She's been 
my main contact. She's been amazing. She has worked with lots and lots and lots of 
disability groups throughout her entire lifetime. And so she's very keen on making things as 
accessible as possible. So one of the things was the handheld signs. The first time I went 
around with her and just spoke to some of the room guides, they said they really really liked 
them. They didn't like how heavy they were. Yeah. So I'm trying to subtly ask all of my 
participants how they feel about the weight of them. Okay. And, and, yeah, you and least two 
other people have both said it's heavy. So that's, that's one thing, certainly. And yeah, 
they're very, very eager to see what they can implement, because obviously, there's certain 
considerations and different things. But 
 
Ellie   
yeah, it's interesting to see kind of how, how differently I guess places like stately homes 
have to approach as opposed to museums where they've got more flexibility to like, do 
structural changes. Yeah, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
exactly. And all of my case study sites are grade two, or grade two star listed Buildings so 
there's not a whole lot of physical changes that they can necessarily do. Yeah. But I think 
that the outcome, my research will show that you don't need to have big giant changes. Just 
stick a couple extra chairs in. Yeah, think about your lighting a little bit more. Maybe make 
the fonts, you know, not so ridiculous, like little changes. That will help just everybody. Yeah, 
and it doesn't have to be a huge expensive undertaking either. So 
 
Ellie   
yeah, because it is just it's little things that can make such a huge difference. And even for, 
like, non... people, like visitors who don't have disabilities, I'm sure like, things like the 
lighting and making sure that fonts are legible. Like it keeps different for everyone. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Exactly. I took a participant around Barley Hall. She had arthritis andshe mentioned the 
lighting because she wasn't able to step into rooms because it was so dark, and she couldn't 
really see where she was going. She didn't want to stumble on things like and stuff like that. 
Yeah, I was like, that makes complete sense. Lighting really is a key issue, even if you don't 
need it to read, or because you have a visual... visual impairment or anything like that. So 
yeah, tiny little changes, helps everybody almost like good design as accessible design. 
 
Ellie   
What a concept?  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I know! But yeah, and then one of my thesis advisory panel members is the equity officer for 
the National Trust. She is in charge of looking at their policies and helping to implement 
some of these different things. And she's been amazing. She's been really good. And she's 
been very, very supportive. So yes, the National Trust is actually quite keen on doing what 
they can.  
 

440 
 
Ellie   
That's great.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
It might take a long time. Yeah. I'm sure there's lots and Lots of discussions that have to be 
done, especially if they're gonna change the lighting levels. But hopefully there will be 
practical change. Yeah. Even if it's as simple as putting little green stickers on the seats you 
can sit on. Yes. more obvious, you know? Yeah, things like that. 
 
Ellie   
because there is nothing more disheartening than when he finally spotted chair and then 
realise it's an antique cheair and can't sit on that one. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So yeah, so that's, that's the answer to that question. Yes. Yeah. In fact, all of the case study 
sites have been quite eager to take on board any Well, they say they're quite eager to take 
on board any, any results that I haven't see. Right. And that's also part of why I'm not just 
taking you guys around, but I'm also shadowing and sort of digging into the, the corporate 
culture of each of them to see how easy it is to change things. Yeah, and, and things like 
that. And then you know, pointedly asking okay well why is it so dark in that room? Is there 
any reason that you don't have an actual light in the pantry for example? Yeah, yeah, you 
know, so 
 
Ellie   
yeah, cuz I guess they're... because all of them they're all sort of within trusts or like larger 
bodies. Yeah, no, no them independence. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. So Abby House Museum is part of Leeds City Council. Barley Hall is obviously part of 
your group, treasures houses National Trust. So they all represent one site out of a group, 
but also quite different organisation types. Yeah. So we've got the big national charity and 
we've got a small local charity and we've also got the local council that's recognised. So 
interest.... it's going to be interesting to see how, how different things change,  
 
Ellie   
Although I was I'd be really interested to see the abbey museum because I was really 
impressed by the City Museum. In terms of I don't know what I don't know if you would call it 
sort of accessibility in the kind of in the same kind of sense, but in the way that they've 
designed their galleries in terms of having lots of different activities and things for people to 
do. So I think, especially if you're with children, and I think so I've got a little bit of 
experiences. My my mom used to work with adults with special educational needs. And in 
terms of like, different activities and different ways of getting the information across that will 
be accessible to everybody in some way, which, which I was really impressed by. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. So that's really interesting. 
 
Ellie   
Yeah. So I'll be interested to see if that's  like, a curator at the City Museum. That's really 
passionate about that. Council wide thing that they're really thinking about, yeah, 

441 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
we're gonna have a lot of fun we go right Every house. Yeah, it is quite big. So I'll warn you 
ahead of time. It's a lot like the castle museum here and about half the size. Okay. It is on 
two floors. So yeah, it's about just that first wing of the castle museum with the Victorians 
street the Victorian room. It's about that size. Okay. Yeah. And they have Victorian street as 
well.  
 
Ellie   
Is it Kirkstall Abbey? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. Okay, it's across the street from it. Yep. Always disappoints me mildly that there's 
nothing to do with the monastery there. No. Abbey house. But that's just me.  
 
Ellie   
Always looking for monks. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Exactly. Everything should be about monks. But you know, I understand that not everybody's 
thing. So any other any other questions you have for me? 
 
Ellie   
I don't think so. No. Okay.  
5.5. Follow-up Email. 
I asked Ellie for her experience with sunflower lanyards. Her email follows. 
 
So I normally only wear the sunflower lanyard in situations where I feel like I will need 
significant help (e.g. airports, train stations – which I haven't been going to over the past 
eighteen months) but I honestly don't know if I would wear one now because of the 
confusion around their use by people who are exempt from masks. I have complete 
sympathy with people who can't wear masks but sort of wish that there was another kind of 
lanyard they could use as I think people are much more aware of it now as just a mask 
exemption rather than also an indication of invisible disability! I'm also concerned by their co-
option by some anti-vaccine campaigners/COVID deniers who are abusing the mask 
exemptions. I really feel like the meaning of the lanyard has changed so much over the past 
two years that it's not actually that useful for people with invisible disabilities any more. 
 
6. James. 
James is a man with fibromyalgia. 
6.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met James at a café in York to conduct this interview on 22 November, 2019. 
 

442 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. Okay, so my script here might sound a bit silly, but I'm Ashley. I know, yeah, we've 
emailed a few times and you know, we actually know each other too. So before we get 
started, I want to go over a few things just to make sure we're all on the same page. My 
research is looking at accessibility for people with hidden disabilities and museum and 
heritage sites. And you've been asked to be a participant because you have a hidden 
disability. As such it will have three meetings one now about how you prepare for a trip one 
immediately after this will be go visit. treasures house and I have a basic outline for things 
will do there. But by and large, I want you to lead the visit because I want to see how you 
experience a museum. And then immediately after that, we'll go to a café or something and 
have a little chat and have some hot chocolate because it's cold outside and then a few days 
Later we'll meet up again and talk about museum visit again and also just a couple other 
things that make sense. Excellent. I have a copy of the information sheets and the consent 
form if you want to have a look at those things and then sign your soul over. Basically I'm not 
gonna sell your data. 
 
James   
But you will sell my soul apparently, yes. Which some completely fine with. Just so you 
know, there wasn't much one left. So 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so do you have any questions before we get started? 
 
James   
Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I have a few questions for you. You mentioned that you have fibromyalgia and I've done 
some research on it. But you're the expert. So can you explain it to me and how it impacts 
your life. 
 
James   
Everything hurt. No, no, no. That's as good as anything. Everything hurts. Okay, so knees, 
ankles. toes fingers, elbows, shoulders neck. Every everything hurts okay? There's also a 
side complication called Costochondritis that appears occasionally flares up with it, which 
means all of your tendons in your chest, inflame. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's really not good,  
 
James   
which means you can't move. It comes and goes, sometimes good. Sometimes are better 
than normal. Some days are okay. And then other days are horrendous. Today I'm on a sort 
of a medium day It has been horrendous but I've had a couple of days rest before this where 
I have on purpose done nothing because of other reasons. Daughter coming up today. 
Excellent. So I wanted to be fit and healthy for her. Yeah. So I've had a couple of days of just 
chilling on the sofa and watching on Netflix. Although not chill and Netflix, no. Just relaxing 
on the sofa and watching Netflix 
 
Ashley Fisher   

443 
 
so um, so it truly impacts your daily life and you have to plan things out more would you say 
 
James   
yeah, I use the spoons method is excellence. So you start off with a number of spoons 
depending on how you feel in the morning and then grade your activities accordingly. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. And you're pretty recently diagnosed with it.  
 
James   
I'd be about.... oo, a year, Id say. A year now. Yeah, go. So yeah, and work have been 
understanding. I've moved from being an interactive at the JORVIK Viking Centre to Barley 
Hall where I get to sit and do nothing all day and glare at people when they come in, as I 
then have to stop reading. [comment about remembering he's being recorded] 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I mean, if we're honest, this is meant to be publicly available, but the likelihood of anybody 
reading this.... 
 
James   
but they've been very understanding and I've moved from an interactive through to Front of 
House at Barley Hall where I've been given a cushion and a special touchscreen pen.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Oh, really? 
 
James   
To help me manage my symptoms. Excellent. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Are there any things that you've changed in your life to sort of help manage the condition? 
 
James   
Yeah, I guess, lots. But just I don't know really I mean I've not really thought about it like that 
but I've changed the way I come into work and I just manage expectations I don't expect to 
do everything at once. I batch cook now rather than just cook a meal for just the day. Yeah. 
Yeah, just little things that just help. Yeah, having recently moved as well that does help. 
Another thing that I probably Yeah, my Alexis okay. So things like turning on light switches 
could hurt if you just press it on a  really bad day and press the light switch pain would just 
rocket through your body and you'll be useless for the next 20 minutes. Yeah, so I got a Wi 
Fi light bulbs and Alexa and now I just say Alexa light on Alexa light off. So I don't have to 
worry about turning on- managing that pain because now it's just some quiet voice control. 
Yeah, there are several of a Alexa things that I'm going to be doing over the next couple of 
years will help me do even more and managing over more. But... money.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's really cool. 
 

444 
 
James   
Yeah. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Very cool that I hadn't even thought about that. Yeah. And before your diagnosis do you 
think it had a massive impact on your life?  
 
James   
yeah. Huge and I probably didn't even realise it. Yeah. I just thought it was age. And this is 
what happens when you get out you know, obviously you have no life experience of it until it 
hits you. But I did notice and work did notice that I was taking more and more more time off. 
That I would wake up in the morning in agonising pain I couldn't understand why I was in 
agonising pain. To be fair, I had been an agonising pain. For five or six years previously, but 
the problem with fibromyalgia is that you cannot, there is no test for it. Right. You have to 
eliminate everything else. Yeah. And, you know, that can include things like MS. So 
obviously, you have those five and six years of non stop tests and you know, waiting for 
appointments and before it was arthritis at one point and all sorts of things. They obviously 
added stress to my life because not knowing what was causing the pains was a big, big 
problem. So the diagnosis was a bit of a blessed relief, horrible to hear but a blessed relief.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
So at least you have  
 
James   
because then we could start working on working out what to do. Yeah. As I say work had 
noticed that I was having more and more time off. it all ended up cumulating once I've been 
diagnosed Talking to Jane Tinsley, and we arranged that I could have a couple of months, 
just off on full pay and everything on on full hours as well. So that was all good. Yeah. Again. 
So that's another thing work being understanding since then I know that that it's kind of 
employment law. It felt good at the time. Yeah. Because they could have easily have said 
quite very easily and quite understandably, sorry, the job is no longer suitable for your 
needs. And we cannot make any reasonable adjustments. Yeah, because the law says that 
they have to make reasonable adjustments, but if they can't, that's not what they can do. 
And I was really worried that as a Viking as an interactive, what reasonable adjustments can 
be made. I couldn't do caps on. I couldn't do caps off. I couldn't do pre show because I 
couldn't stand for too long. I couldn't do coins because I couldn't hold a hammer. I wasn't 
trusted to do pod because I might drop the objects because of the pain and I couldn't walk 
around I couldn't walk around galleries because being on the It's about time. So it was just 
like, gee, what reasonable adjustments can we make? Because I literally cannot do any 
other position apart from sit on the boat and go [phrase in Old Norse]. And that was it. So 
obviously, mentally I was really down because I was scared that I might lose my job. Yeah. 
Because of reasonable adjustments and how are they going to be possible? Yeah. So when 
the chance came up that they said, Look, we can offer you some Barley Hall and some 
JORVIK admission shifts. You're sat down, we can get you a nice cushion, we can get you a 
touchscreen pencil. You're not putting pressure on your fingers. Welcome environment. 
Yeah. Yeah. And I will say that to anyone who wants to listen, they could not have been, 
they have bent over backwards. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Very, very glad to hear that. One of the things I'm doing my research, obviously, I'm going 
around the sites with participants, but also I'm shadowing at all my Case Study organisations 

445 
 
and seeing how they treat their employees in situations like this. And it's very, very 
comforting to hear 
 
James   
that I couldn't fault them. Yeah, they're always asking how I am. Chantelle wants to do a 
follow up on how it's going in the next couple of weeks, maybe months. Who knows? 
Communication that is an issue, but that is a completely separate thing. But yeah, so now 
health wise, controlling the mental health with it, controlling my physical health with it. They 
as a heritage company, again, you couldn't ask for more. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Wonderful. Okay, so let's talk about how you get ready for a trip to museum. Do you actually 
go to museums 
 
James   
occasionally, occasionally. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And how do you get ready for it? 
 
James   
I make sure I'm up and okay to do it. Yeah. obvious instant. If the pain is too bad, obviously, 
you know any plans just go out the window and lay in bed all day and read a book. But, 
yeah, it depends. If it's a smallish Museum, it's not too bad on a half decent day, you know, 
you just sort of like just mentally prepare yourself that you're going to be on your feet. Yeah, 
you don't do too much before you're going to go out. If it's a big Museum, then you do 
nothing until you're going and you know it's going to be painful, but you're gonna go and 
enjoy it. And then you go home and when you collapse and curl up into a ball and die.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
That sounds about right. Yeah. Do you do any information research or anything like that 
beforehand, or you just 
 
James   
No, I like to be surprised.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. 
 
James   
And disability wise. I mean, within York, at least, you know which ones would be hard and 
which ones would be Yeah. You know, for example going to Richard III or Henry VII from 
those stairs. It's probably not the best of ideas on a bad pain day. Yeah. But, yeah, no, I 
mean, I just sort of take it and if I can't do it all and if the stairs look too much at the time, you 
just don't do that part.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay.  

446 
 
 
James   
I mean, there is times when I've gone halfway random museum and gone. I can't I can't do it 
anymore thinking you're on a good day but and then you get there and then all of a sudden it 
snaps and you're just like, No, I want to go home and die. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
When you're getting ready to go out, is there any specialist equipment or aids or anything 
like that, that you bring 
 
James   
on a really bad day I'll bring a stick. But then on a really bad day. I don't... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
You're probably not going to go out either. Yeah. Do you plan for eventualities or 
emergencies or anything like that?  
 
James   
Nah, not really. We got we got we got smartphones these days so if an emergency comes 
up you can pretty much find out what you need. Yeah. call anybody you need to say no 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So having a good support structure. Yeah. excellent. How much time would you say it takes 
to get everything ready to go? 
 
James   
Not long. Like actually physically getting my clothes on and yeah they can depends on 
depending on the day. I mean, if it's a really bad pain day when you sit in bed and you don't 
do nothing, yeah. On a half decent day, you know, takes me about 20 minutes to get my 
clothes on. Yeah. Which may seem like a long time for just slipping on a T shirt, pair of jeans 
and if that's what it takes, yes, that's roughly how long it took. Yes. Okay. I'm not up and out 
in like two and a half seconds. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. Alright, so those are the questions I have for our pre visit interview for the visit 
itself. We're going to be doing what we call a semi structured visit. where basically by and 
large I'm just going to follow your lead we'll go where you want to last as long as you want to. 
It can last last five minutes if you want to, I really don't care. We're just going to make sure 
we hit a few points. One is making sure we visit a particular room. It's the blue drawing room. 
I will let you know when we get there. Another is asking a member of staff for help or asking 
questions, something like that. And one is purchasing a small item from the shop. I have five 
pounds with me so Don't worry about it, knock yourself out, and we're going to visit the 
toilets. So all fairly basic things that people look. Yeah, very much not want to visit right? And 
then after the visit will go and have snack or drink or something nearby and we'll go through 
a couple more questions and everything makes sense. Yep. Fantastic. 
6.2. Site Visit. 
Our visit to Treasurer’s House took place on the same day. 
 

447 
 
Staff member   
So as you go around, do take photos, there's information boards in the corner 
 
James   
I might disagree with the whole principle of ropes. But it does give you a flow. So as 
someone who's going to struggle, I'm going to struggle to get ready. And again, you feel like 
you want to see it all. 
 
James   
This handrail, so there’s nothing to grab and hold on to. So if you do suffer from fibro, like 
me, they've blocked off the handrails. That's bad.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. You're actually the third participant to point that out.,  
 
James   
And that's pretty horrendous, really. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
and and you can tell that they don't have to be like here for example 
 
James   
It could have easily gone over the top rather than the actual handrail. So that's bad. 
 
6.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
After our site visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct this interview, still on the same 
day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How was it getting to the museum? 
 
James   
Well, fine, as I said. On the thing, disabled access was not clearly marked, which I would 
have preferred to have taken rather than steps. Yeah, I mean fine. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If you were travelling to the treasurer's house from your flat, how would you have gone about 
it? 
 
James   
Bus 
 
Ashley Fisher   
bus 
 

448 
 
James   
which would stop by Stonebow and then walk. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so let's think about the museum in general. Was it easy to find the museum from the 
street? 
 
James   
from the street that it's on, yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. 
 
James   
But in general, no, it's a bit tricky to find it. Yes. No, real clear signage is a bit like Barley 
Hall. You don't know it's there until you're there. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah. Was it easy to find the entrance? 
 
James   
Well, that paths kinda led you there. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And did you find the layout of the museum easy to understand? 
 
James   
No, not at all.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Like we were saying there wasn't really a flow to it. And there were multiple points where 
you're like, have you been here before? Yeah. 
 
James   
Yeah, I got confused as to whether, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah, alright, so thinking about the shop in particular, was a signage, easy to understand 
 
James   
Yeah, basically.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I mean, there was a sign on the register that said pay for food and drink here. And the 
purchases upstairs. 
 

449 
 
James   
Yeah. Which is very weird. Weird. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was there enough space to move around the shop?  
 
James   
Yeah. I mean, it wasn't busy. So yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was it easy to navigate the shop? 
 
James   
Yeah, well it was just one room. And there was nothing really on its way. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Very open. Yeah. That's not the page I want to turn. So thinking about the toilets now, were 
they easy to find?  
 
James   
They were. Yeah, well, sort of. I mean, that's just my lack of general directions. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
But there were a few signs here and there, were they clean 
 
James   
Yep 
 
Ashley Fisher   
where the floors clean. 
 
James   
Sorry, no, no.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Excellent. obviously haven't been inside the gents, so I don't know. Thinking about the 
staff. Did team members treat you any differently than another visitor?  
 
James   
Don't think so. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Was the team member able to offer help when asked? 
 
James   

450 
 
One of them did say are you okay there, be careful. So I'd go with Yes. Okay. Yeah. It was a 
woman who was talking to us in one of the bedrooms and talking to us about the 
tortoiseshell. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
She was very nice. Yeah. 
 
James   
She said are you alright there. Be careful. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's very nice. Um, did you feel welcomed at the museum?  
 
James   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Not like, other museums that shall remain nameless. The exhibits in general were the 
displays clear. 
 
James   
I mean, I didn't read too much of the displays as you know. I'd prefer to talk to the Yeah, the 
volunteers. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
But it was easy to see like the objects and that? 
 
James   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
we didn't listen to any video. 
 
James   
We did  
 
Ashley Fisher   
we What?  
 
James   
We watched that video?   
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. So how would you say the sound level was for the video?  
 
James   

451 
 
I mean, I think it was just video wasn't audio. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
There was a little bit of music in the back Yeah. 
 
James   
Sound Level was fine for me 
 
Ashley Fisher   
not very memorable then know. were the stories and tales. [drinks arrive] Were the stories 
and Tales of the experience easy to understand.  
 
James   
Yeah  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I think they did a good job connecting rooms between the guides as well. how is the overall 
noise level  
 
James   
It was fine 
 
Ashley Fisher   
any places that were too loud.  
 
James   
No 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Any places that were too quiet? 
 
James   
No, nothing. It was nice. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What about the lighting levels?  
 
James   
bit low. But understandable at the same time. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Were there any places that were overall too light? 
 
James   
No, no, I would say I'm generally it was just a bit too dark. 
 

452 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Were there any places that you think were too dark? 
 
James   
With the room which, again, that same lady showed us the tortoiseshell she literally had to 
get a torch out to show us certain things. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there enough places to sit and over rest? 
 
James   
On the whole? Yes, there were a couple of rooms that didn't have a chair where you could 
sit, or at least I could see. Yeah. The guides were perfectly happy for you to sit on the ones 
that you could 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. thinking specifically to the blue drawing room, which was the one with the big giant 
fireplace and the Christmas tree. Let's think about that specific room were the displays and 
everything clear and easy to see.  
 
James   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Where the stories and tales in that particular room easy to understand. 
 
James   
Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How was the noise level again?  
 
James   
Fine,  
 
Ashley Fisher   
and the lighting 
 
James   
again, you know, a bit on the dark side, but you know, I understand why it has to be that dim. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah. And were there enough places to sit or rest in that room. 
 
James   
I can't remember. 

453 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Give that a no then 
 
James   
I would say on a busy day because obviously we're out of season. Yeah. But I would say on 
a busy day in general that will be because of the sort of attraction that would attract the older 
person who may need to sit down a bit more. Yeah. So in general, I would say there wasn't 
enough on a busy day. you know, even though I've got a disability, you would feel wrong 
taking that seat. If that makes sense, but that's just me. To sum up in general. When I think 
about what a busy day I would say that that probably wouldn't be enough seats. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So what's, what was your favourite thing about the museum in general 
 
James   
I quite like the volunteers to be honest. Yes, they were chatting and engaging, which is nice. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
James   
It does make a change,  
 
Ashley Fisher   
it does really makes a difference. 
 
James   
but I say the same thing at JORVIK, I think your experience of your visit vastly depends on 
who's working. Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
In sites where there are quite a lot of people stationed around employees and volunteers 
and such, it really does make a difference as to who's there 
 
James   
And I won't mention any names, but they're both gone now. But there were a couple of 
people there who didn't want to talk to anybody, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
which is kind of the opposite of your job description. 
 
James   
Little bit. So, you know, like everywhere else, you know, I mean, that can be volunteers that 
they have that don't engage. Yeah, yeah. So maybe just got lucky. But yeah, all the 
volunteers were very straight on it. Yeah. 
 

454 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I will say that like the fourth or fifth time I've gone around, every time they've been brilliant. 
So I can't think of a single one that I was like. Yeah, 
 
James   
yeah. Yeah. All very good. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What was your least favourite thing about the museum in general? 
 
James   
The lack of being able to hold on to the handrails. It's a big thing. No, it is. Yeah. If you put 
things that you can hold on to. Yeah. Going up to quite a lot of stairs. Yeah, I mean, at that 
point, I instantly had to sit down. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah. I'm laughing because you're the second person that that's their Least favourite 
thing about the museum. It's a big thing, actually. And 
 
James   
then you might want to hold on to the going upstairs here.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, exactly. And it's clearly something that Wasn't thought about. It needed. Two 
seconds.  
 
James   
It looked pretty, but it was completely impractical. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
One good thing about accessibility related to the museum. 
 
James   
Well it was flat, It was quite flat, no trip hazards. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And one bad thing related to site. 
 
James   
The stairs. I mean, you can't expect there to be stellar stair lifts. You can't expect that to be 
lifts. Yes. So they don't count because you're visiting that type of building. It's like coming to 
Barley Hall, or one of the medieval sites you know, I'm saying well, why isn't that lift? Well, 
because it's a 700-year-old building.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Because there can't be  
 

455 
 
James   
Yeah, so the handrails 
 
Ashley Fisher   
did any barriers jumped out at you? 
 
James   
Okay, the handrail was such a bad idea. Yeah. on accessibility issues. It was just wrong on 
every level. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think the museum could have provided anything that would have helped you go 
around 
 
James   
those little seats that we discussed that you saw in the shop? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What should the museum design into their exhibition from the very beginning  
 
James   
more handrails, so more sort of things that you can just pull- even on only two or three steps. 
It may not seem like anything to them,  
 
Ashley Fisher   
but that makes a big difference.  
 
James   
It makes a big difference. So just something to hold on to you as you go up the steps. 
 
- 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Back to the staff. How did they make you feel?  
 
James   
Welcome. very welcome. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And do you think you would have been treated differently if your disability had been visible, 
or more visible 
 
James   
Probably. Yes. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   

456 
 
How so do you think? 
 
James   
I don't know. I would just, you would feel, or you'd hope at least that they'd be like, if you 
need to sit, take one, that type of things so so just because you haven't – because of the 
hidden disabilities. They think obviously immediately there's nothing wrong with you. Until ou 
say, there's something wrong with me. And do you mind if I take this seat? Yeah, okay. But I 
feel that if we did have a physical- walking around with a stick, and they would say, Well, do 
you feel free to take a seat 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If you could tell the museum one thing regarding the accessibility of their site, what would it 
be?  
 
James   
Guess. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Is it going to be the handrails?  
 
James   
Yes! Funny, that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Shocking. But see, these are all small. It's a very small change. And it doesn't have that 
much impact. It's not that expensive to do. But just make sure that you tie it on differently. 
Yeah. That is hopefully the point of all of this research that it's the Little things that make a 
big difference. I mean, yeah. Excellent. So for next time, just think about other visits to the 
museum. The museums you've worked at too. And we'll just have a chat we can meet at a 
café or a pub or dig again, whichever you prefer. Whatever.  
6.4. Follow-up Interview. 
We met at a café in York on 25 November, 2019 to conduct this interview. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. So, hello. Hello again. How are you? I'm good, good. So we're just going to do a quick 
recap of our visit. Too much went on and get ready. So how are you feeling the next day? 
 
James   
Yeah, two weeks ago. That was a feeling the next day two weeks ago. Yeah.O kay. Yeah. 
But yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Would you say it's more than normal? Or sort of what was expected after a day? What was 
expected of this like?  
 
James 

457 
 
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I was fully prepped for 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I sent you that photo that they just did the Yes. I know. I was looking back through the notes 
and that was like your biggest problem. 
 
James   
Someone must have told him 
 
Ashley Fisher   
must have Yes. Oh, yeah. So now that that has been taken care of 
 
James   
everything else was fine – apart from probably in the summer when they wouldn't been 
enough chairs. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure. Okay. 
 
James   
For anyone with problems to sit down, yeah. You know, one chair in a room. All it takes is 
two or three people wouldn't ability issues. Yeah. That ran at roughly the same time and 
exactly 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. I can't remember if I asked you, would you visit the museum again? 
 
James   
I mean, if it was my sort of thing. Yes. Okay. Yeah. It's a nice building, but it's not really your 
it's it's not my sort of period. Yeah. So I enjoyed the most right. I feel Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Did this. Did the treasurer's house remind you of any other museums? You visited 
 
James   
every single National Trust property on the planet? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. So pretty standard then. 
 
James   
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, they have a they have a, they have a tick box list and they adhere to it 
and read properties. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

458 
 
Thank you back. Are there any stellar museum experiences that stand out in your mind 
when it comes to accessibility? 
 
James   
I'm gonna be honest: JORVIK. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Good. 
 
James   
Sing our praises. Just very good. Awesome. The latest access I mean, yes, can only have 
one wheelchair user at the time, but all the staff are fully trained to handle people with visual 
impairments any well any impairment at all. Yeah, they've got lovely chairs that you can take 
around and sit on. There isn't quite another museum like I mean, the chocolate story is very, 
very good as well. They've always got the chance that you can sit back draggable chairs you 
can't take them wherever you need. Yeah, front though the fixtures for our Yeah. So yeah, I 
mean, honestly, I mean without, you know, blowing our own trumpet your week does very, 
very well with that. So yeah, I think so too. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think there are different expectations put on paying versus non paying museums? 
 
James   
Yes, I think paying museums, there's an expectation is that you have to go above and 
beyond almost. But it should be outstanding because you're paying for the museum. On a 
personal level, I don't agree with non paying museums because the people who work there 
deserve to be paid. Yeah. Now I know for example, the railway museum. They stopped 
getting paid. Yeah, that's all from charitable donations. Yeah, rather than anything else. As 
far as I'm aware, I don't know the intricacies But no, I I think museums to keep up to date 
with technologies and accessibility needs and everything they should all be paid for 
museums rather than having to rely on anything else. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's the only 
guaranteed way of getting an income. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If we had taken this trip on a bad day, would it have changed anything? I 
 
James   
wouldn't have ended up with on the stairs. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Yeah. 
 
James   
Especially with those handrail problems but even in general, I wouldn't have been able to 
download them stairs. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
There's a lot of stairs in there. There is an awful lot of stairs. 

459 
 
 
James   
So yeah, there's no there's no other way of getting around. Now I understand that it's a 
historic moment when you come in cetera, but maybe a challenge would have been in the 
family thing or some. You can get these things. I don't know. There should be ways around 
it. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
One thing that they do offer is a tablet that has a photo guys, the different rooms that you 
would be able to see. How do you think that would? Would it 
 
James   
be? Okay, we do, do it. We don't do it here [at Barley Hall] actually. We used to do it here. 
Don't have a tablet. I think virtual reality would be a better way of doing it. Okay? Because 
it's more immersive whereas tablet is just photos. You could look at them online. Yeah. But 
some sort of interactive way of being able to explore would be a better, better means. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So this is quite a personal question. Do you consider yourself disabled? 
 
James   
Slowly, slowly? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Do you prefer a disabled person or a person with a disability 
 
James   
haven't gotten that far. 
7. Jessica. 
Jessica is a woman with dyslexia and Irlen syndrome. 
7.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met Jessica at her home to conduct this interview on 22 October, 2019. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So my research is looking at accessibility for people with hidden disabilities in museums and 
heritage sites. And you've been asked to be a participant because you have hidden 
disability, as I mentioned, will have three meetings one now so I can learn how you prepare 
for a trip one later today afterwards, where we go to the museum. In your case, it's going to 
be treasurer's house here in York, and I'll have a basic outline of things for us to do. But by 
and large, I want you to lead the visit so I can understand how your disability might affect 
your experience after the museum will go to a café or a pub or something and have a chat 
about the experience as a whole. And then a few days from now we'll have our last meeting, 
or we'll talk about the museum visit that we took together. Yeah. And also about other 
museums that you've been to and how they compare. Yeah, that's all right. 
 

460 
 
Jessica   
Yep. Excellent. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's great. Now I have a few questions for you. Yep. And these are bit personal. So you're 
free to say no, you don't want to answer them at any time. But you mentioned that you have 
dyslexia and Erlen's Yes, that correct?  
 
Jessica   
Correct.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. I've done a little research on them. Yeah, you're the expert. So can you explain 
them to me. 
 
Jessica   
And so with my learning difficulty and dyslexia, it basically means that I... my brain works in a 
different way. So I kind of learned in different way to kind of what you normally would be 
taught in school and stuff. And so I particularly struggle with spelling and kind of reading and 
stuff like that and being able to kind of find the difference between different types of words 
and stuff like that. It's like they're and there like a different type two spellings and stuff. And 
then with Erlen's syndrome, and it's a light sensitivity and disability. And so for example, if 
there's really harsh lighting, or if there's lots of like, you know, writing on a page like this, and 
I find it quite hard to read it because my brain is kind of working really hard. And that's when 
I kind of started to get a bit tired and a bit stressed and a bit frustrated. And so I do have a 
colored overlay. And, and I when I kind of went through my disability, training and stuff like 
that, once I was diagnosed, I kind of got lots of software and Stuff like that on my computer. 
And so it will do it. It'll kind of read websites out loud to me or even PDFs and stuff like that. 
It's really cool. Like, yeah, the stuff that it can do. So it kind of, so instead of having to kind of 
just sit there and read, I can just have it read to me. And basically when I'm was like 
proofreading in my work and stuff like that, because I could read but you remember 1000 
times I'm not seeing any spelling mistakes, that soon it's as it's being read aloud to me, I can 
easily kind of point out an "I've used "wrong spelling there," or "I've misspelled that," or 
"that's probably when I could use a new sentence or a new paragraph" or stuff like that. So 
yeah, that's basically my disability in a nutshell. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. And because these are both types of neurodivergency, you're born with them. Is 
that correct? Yes, 
 
Jessica   
exactly. So it was really weird because I didn't get diagnosed until last year. Yeah. Um, so 
you know, even though I've lived a bit, you know, the whole of my life. It was until I got 
diagnosed where I was probably you're probably able to kind of see like, okay, you know, it's 
not because I'm stupid. Yeah because I generally have a disability and I just need some 
extra tools to do for me to be able to kind of you know, read and kind of excel in studying 
and stuff like that. So it was kind of one of those things where it was quite sad when I was 
first diagnosed I thought well obviously if I'm got disability, then I can't be in you know, I can't 
study. Then it was a bit like, Well, no, actually, it's quite a relief because it means that 
because I was was stuck, I was just stupid and just needed to work harder. And actually, that 
was not not the case. Oh, 

461 
 
 
- 
 
Ashley Fisher   
5All right, so now when you prepare for a trip, I want you to walk me through what you do. 
What do you research anything ahead of time? Do you look for websites? Do you look at 
TripAdvisor, anything like that? What do you do to prepare for it?  
 
Jessica   
So the thing is, for next I was obviously so on the question. As I was thinking about that, it's 
very hard to because obviously having studied museums and being generally interested in 
museums, it's quite hard to kind of take it apart, like what I do my disability and what I do, 
because I'm interested in in museums and how they work and how they're set up and stuff. 
But I think in in general, I do kind of definitely do a little bit of research about the museum, 
not the actual museum itself, but the actual history and content behind it because because I 
do kind of learn in my own time and in my own way, I do find it quite nice to have that basic 
standing before I go. So then when I am kind of reading the materials there, I already 
understand a little bit  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure,  
 
Jessica   
just because I'm a little bit scared that because it does take me sometimes a little bit longer 
to fully grasp concepts and stuff. And if I'm not in my own comfortable space and able to use 
my own personal tools like my coloured overlay or my laptop and stuff, that I'm scared that 
I'm not really gonna be able to grasp the comments like the the actual concept of the history 
of stuff in the background. So I do always kind of like to do a little bit of background research 
mainly using videos and stuff. And just because I do enjoy kind of learning the kind of via 
audio and stuff like that, rather than then reading is what I've noticed I learn better that way 
to be able to actually grasp what's being said. So I do to kind of go on YouTube, or I might 
find a podcast or a documentary or something like that. And that's kind of how I find I I enjoy 
learning more that way. And I do use the see if they have any audio guides. So I do kind of 
research about Museum in terms of having the audio guides if there's an extra charge for it 
or anything like that, because if there is like a free audio guide, I do tend to want to use it 
better because I know that I will learn better around the museum rather than just stood there 
and reading but if there's usually an extra charge, then I do kind of make that decision. 
Whether it's Hey, am I going to take the audio guide on my not going to do a guide kind of 
thing because sometimes I like 20 pounds, but normally guys like I'm not gonna pay that I 
used to do look at TripAdvisor for kind of when the busiest times are. And because I do 
prefer to go when it's a bit quiet so I'm not feeling as bad if I'm stood right in front of the text 
panel, kind of because if it's quite hard to, to read because of the colors of the text panel or 
the harsh lighting, yeah, I do have to go quite close to be able to kind of read it and stuff like 
that. If it's really busy that I'm not going to want to do that because I feel quite awkward and 
quite pressured. And so do kind of kind of see what's the best times to go. So I know if it's 
going to be quiet or not. So I can kind of prepare myself okay, how much am I going to be 
able to kind of learn and how long am I going to spend in museum dependent on how busy it 
actually is going to be and I think that's kind of the The main things I do like before I do go 
mainly to see if there's audio guides or if there's any sentiments you can tell by the pictures 
that they have any headset so like stuff like that actually in the exhibitions themselves which 
is quite useful but then because they're quite popular because it's quite a good way to 

462 
 
engage people these the quite- they're already taken over as people can be noticed my bit ly 
on do i do i wait for that do I not? And I kind of research all that beforehand to kind of see 
what I'm going to expect before I go so I'm not kind of going in and all that know where do I 
go and what to do. I'm going to have an enjoyable time here. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Have you done any research into treasurer's house? 
 
Jessica   
Yes, I do some research this morning.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent.  
 
Jessica   
And I saw that in some of the room Did you have the headsets and stuff like that? And I 
found Treasurer's House website quiet hard to to navigate. There wasn't much information 
on the They're about what there's there's quite a lot of the ghost tours, yes. What kind of I 
didn't believe through that website, it's kind of find out about treasurer's house because it 
wasn't about like, there wasn't like a about us page or anything like that it was only like a 
little snippet about the actual house itself. It was kind of funded by, and the Roman road 
nearby and stuff. But, yes, I kind of mainly use different websites and stuff to kind of find out 
a little bit more about the history and stuff like that. And I didn't see that they had an audio 
guide. But yeah, as I said, like in the pictures and stuff, I saw that it did have the headsets 
and stuff and some of the rooms and which is something that I would naturally kind of go 
towards to when I'm visiting the museum. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. Now, were there any particular websites that you found useful outside of the 
 
Jessica   
So mainly, and I know we've always been to told  to stay away but I do enjoy using 
Wikipediajust because and it does just have like simple facts. And obviously I'm always very 
cautious when I'm you know, information is very accurate but just for the purpose of just kind 
of finding the base understanding of the concept, you know, when it was builtor you know 
what it's good to see there and stuff like that just living on the history. I do like using 
Wikipedia, YouTube as well. And for any kind of videos I haven't done on it. I didn't find any 
treasurer's house in my search. And then I also I do like to use the website and using my 
read aloud kind of software and stuff just to kind of find out more information about the 
website and the opening times and stuff like that. And so TripAdvisor as well. I used to have 
a quick look on that to see what people have said, but the actual place itself and there's 
usually quite a lot of people talking about kind of wheelchair access and kind of how they 
found it and that the accommodation, how the staff was and stuff like that. So that's quite 
useful to know, as a, as someone who has a disability to kind of see the kind of atmosphere 
that's kind of at the other place, because I visited some museums in you know, Eastern 
Europe, but that is not the same as here in the UK  
 
Ashley Fisher   
a little bit different. All right. So you said that you used a read aloud program? Yeah. 
Anything else that you use? 

463 
 
 
Jessica   
Um, so yeah, mainly use reading read aloud and my color overlay. And mainly when I'm just 
doing just kind of research about museums and stuff like that. I don't really use any extra 
software like that. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. And that's all on your laptop. Do you have any on your phone or anything like 
that?  
 
Jessica   
Yeah. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. When we're done, I'm going to show you a really cool app that might change the 
world really exciting. So when you're physically preparing Is there any specialist equipment 
or aids or things like that, that you need or that you plan to bring or anything like that. So 
 
Jessica   
sometimes, I'm going to a museum that I know that I do really want to engage and I'm really 
excited to go about and I do have a little color overlay that I can it's just kind of like pocket 
size, I can just take that with me. And I find that quite useful. But again, if there's people 
around, I won't usually use it because I'm quite embarrassed. So I only do that if I get a quiet 
moment alone. Or if I'm going during like a really quiet period of time, and there's not really 
many people around like okay, I can probably get my overlay out and maybe because 
sometimes what I've noticed and some of the museum's when they kind of like to have like 
lighting behind the panel and stuff like that is the I can't see anything at all. Yeah, there's just 
the the light is just kind of too. Yeah, it just kind of messes with my eyes too much and I just 
can't even read it a  
 
Ashley Fisher   
kind of like a backlit thing.  
 
Jessica   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. 
 
Jessica   
So in that case, if there's no one around kind of sometimes using my, my overlay can help a 
little bit but again, I'm sometimes a bit too embarrassed to get it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right, are there other eventualities that you plan for.  
 
Jessica   

464 
 
not really I mean, I kind of plan for if, if the museum is going to be busy, and if it's not going 
to be very accommodating to my disability, then I'll just know that I'll just do a quick walk 
around the museum. Maybe if there's any videos, I might watch them and then I usually just 
leave Yeah. It's sometimes that that just just happens. I'm just not engaging with it. And 
there's no point of kind of giving myself a headache Yeah, it's just not gonna be good for me 
in the end. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So do you do get actual physical side effects? 
 
Jessica   
Sometimes Yeah, if if you know I'm quite tired anyways. And you know, there's quite kind of 
glare-ish lights and stuff like in Primark a few times when I was younger, I did pass out and 
stuff and obviously I just didn't realize what it was when I did my mom just thought it was part 
of my heart condition. But when I had my tests when my Erlen's in July did mention about 
the lights in Primark sometimes she did I did pass out she was like, Yeah, I've had lots of 
people had that before. Because they're so bright and so like, yeah, it's just really weird. And 
so sometimes Yeah, if I'm a bit light or not, I can't handle these lights. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Okay. And how much time does it normally take you to get all of this together. Um, 
 
Jessica   
if I'm just kind of planning for, you know, one trip to a museum, it might only really take me 
maybe about 20 minutes of research, maybe a little bit longer. I'm really interested in the 
place that I'm going to or if I'm planning like a long trip somewhere like a weekend in 
Edinburgh, then I might kind of maybe take some notes on my phone. And then when I'm 
kind of there, I kind of remember which museums about which and stuff and I can kind of just 
kind of quickly refresh my mind and stuff. So if it's like a longer trip, when I'm visiting a few 
places, it might take me maybe an hour or something like that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. So let me give you a couple of details about our trip today. So we're doing what 
we've dubbed a semi structured visit. Okay, basically, by and large, I'm going to follow your 
lead. Yeah, we'll go where you want the museum spend as much time as you like in it, 
whatever you like. I want this to be as normal a visit for you as possible. That being said, 
there are a few basic points I want to make sure we hit hence the semi structured so we will 
visit a particular exhibition room for the trash. House, we're going to spend some time in the 
sitting room. Yeah. Which you probably will anyway, you're going to ask a member of staff 
for help. Yeah. And we're going to purchase a small item from the shop, I have five pound 
note that you can use, don't worry. And then we're going to visit the toilets. Okay. Pretty 
basic ones that almost everyone does on a regular trip. So it just helps me to compare visits 
amongst my participants. Yeah. So that we all have certain points that Yeah, I can actually 
directly compare them. Like I said, after museum will go to nearby pub, have a drink or lunch 
or whatever, and do a bit of a debrief. You've got the questions for those as well. And I want 
to do a visit audit with you. Okay. Basically, we'll go through a checklist, see how the 
museum did in certain areas, like levels is actually one of the things I was very interested in. 
So this is great. How easy to read signs worth things like that. Yeah, that makes sense. 
Yeah. Excellent. All right. 

465 
 
7.2. Site Visit. 
Our visit to Treasurer’s House took place on the same day. A technical error meant that the 
audio recording did not work. 
7.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
After our site visit, we walked to a nearby café to conduct this interview, still on the same 
day. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, so we just came back from the abbey house there we go. All right. So how did you 
find walking there? 
 
Jessica   
Um, yeah, it was it was fine. I'm using Google Maps and it took  straight to the to the actual 
place itself obviously wasn't really sign posted I didn't realize I was there until I saw the sign 
that says treasures house and the actual work itself was was fine to me. Okay. Well, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay well, I have a Treasurer's House pen now so it's fine wasn't really signposted Google 
Maps. 
 
Jessica   
Yes. Okay. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think the museum could have provided any more information about how to get there, 
or 
 
Jessica   
I mean, I think it is kind of in the center of York and they did kind of say that it was by the 
Minster on the website, if I remember correctly and obviously, the Minster is quite easy to 
find. Once you kind of situated yourself from the Minster then I guess, you know, you 
probably would be able to kind of see, okay, that's where Treasurer's House is but obviously 
from the way that we came from it yeah you know, there was no kind of sign post and just 
kind of what it was handy to have the sign outside that said, Yeah, Treasurer's House 
otherwise I would have walked straight past it. Yeah. And to that, for the fact that he had a 
sign outside was quite handy. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. So let's go through our museum audit. Was it easy to find the entrance to the 
museum from the street  
 
Jessica   
yes I was going to go into the of entrance and then it says this is the delivers entrance into 
the main entrance 
 
Ashley Fisher   

466 
 
was the layout of the museum easy to understand 
 
Jessica   
I mean it wasn't really clear on where to go as search and but I think that with the there was 
kind of once you kind of – when you went upstairs and you went down you came back down 
he went up the stairs he went round and then he went down. Yeah, that that that kind of 
makes sense. But at first I was a bit unsure of where kind of the actual thing that all all the 
rooms where it might have been handy to to have a map of kind of where they suggest you 
to kind of go so obviously people like to take their their own routes and stuff, but there are 
some times where I wasn't sure whether you could go up the stairs or stuff like that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
was the signage is in the shop? Was the signage easy to understand? 
 
Jessica   
Yeah, there was there was a sign that said to the toilets and to the Tea house and then you 
went straight through the, through the shop, which was obviously their their shop. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was there enough space to move around? 
 
Jessica   
It was quite a small shop. Quite No, but I think we were quite quite lucky that it wasn't too 
busy in there, actually. Yeah, I can imagine that when you get in on peak times at the 
weekend. I can imagine that and be quite busy to handle but when we were there it was. I 
felt I had plenty of space to kind of look around and stuff. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Was it easy to navigate the shop?  
 
Jessica   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right, the toilets. W the toilets? easy to find? 
 
Jessica   
Yeah. Yeah, there's a sign that says it was clearly marked which one male and female the 
toilets were nice themselves. They were clean. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was a floor clean. Yeah. So Staff. Did the staff members treat you any differently than any 
other visitors?  
 
Jessica   
no, but the members of staff are really nice and were very knowledgeable loves talking about 
the ghosts They must have like a quota each day of how many times they can mention the 

467 
 
ghosts. You must mention the ghosts at least six times on your shift today. Otherwise you're 
fired. Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
They do mention the ghosts a lot. Was the team member able to offer appropriate help when 
asked? Yeah, 
 
Jessica   
yeah, the first guy when I asked why it was so dark, he explained why and stuff and the lady 
when I asked her what the toilets was she, you know, kind of gave more of a direction. She 
kind of went downstairs and then kind of met next to the Tea Room rather than just saying, 
oh, they're just downstairs. Yeah, she kind of explained there and directions and that, which 
was good. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, did you feel welcomed at the museum?  
 
Jessica   
I did. It was Yeah, it was really nice. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
A great strength the treasure is houses all of their stuff are really really really nice yes which 
is not the case at all my sites the exhibits in general where the displays clear 
 
Jessica   
yeah I mean it was... There wasn't so much information you know you don't have you know 
wall to wall full of information compared to some of the museum's have been in so obviously 
you did have the the panels, which were kind of broken up into themes which was quite nice 
and then you can kind of you knew kind of which theme you wanted to look at it and in each 
room then so that was quite nice. And obviously there's some of the way that the photos 
were positioned within the text and was quite difficult to kind of then be able to concentrate 
and read. And obviously some of some of the panels they hadquite a lot of bold writing on 
and some Itallics that made it quite difficult to read the actual the in depth one, which had 
one, it had like a little.. in the corner 123 you know, which generally mean and they were 
quite nice to read and it wasn't you know, didn't have too much information on it. And the 
actual panel itself was quite light and quite small to handle. The actual background was went 
quite like quite went quite nicely with the actual text. So that was quite enjoyable to read in 
each of the rooms and stuff. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. Were the fonts easy to read.  
 
Jessica   
So yeah, I think in most cases and the fonts was was quite nice. I think there was one case 
where sometimes on the on the theme, text panels, and sometimes and you know where the 
the image Was it kind of emphasize that the text that they were using kind of made it quite 
hard to read in those cases? So overall the fonts that they used was quite nice but kind of 
was exacerbated with different kind of things like the the image and the lighting and stuff like 
that. 

468 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so it's more the context of font. Yeah, it was what let it down.  
 
Jessica   
Yeah, exactly.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
was the color contrast appropriate?  
 
Jessica   
Yeah. So what I quite liked about all of the the, the panels that you could handle is that it 
was an on bright white paper and the the smaller one it was kind of creamy and then the 
themes ones It was kind of like a like a Bluey kind of tint or a Greenie kind of tint or, or a 
purple kind of tint which is kind of what a color overlay is anyway, so that that made it quite 
nice and actually read against the text itself. I think that if it was kind of bright white, it would 
have made it a lot harder. And so the actual with the contrast between the actual 
background and the the text itself is quite nice and also when we went up to the the top room 
and that was quite nice as you said, Actually with the brown writing and especially compared 
to the black one that was on the wall even though it was the same color background it was I 
see a lot easier with brown because the the kind of the contrast was a lot lot smoother, but 
the black and white kind of thing. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, how's the volume of the videos cuz you watch one with the headphones? 
 
Jessica   
Yeah, so yeah, that that was fine actually, I think obviously with having the headphones on is 
naturally a noise cancelling and kind of tool anyways and I thought You have the volume 
was perfectly fine. And which was which is quite handy because I know I have been in the 
Yorkshire museum and they have videos on and you can't hear a thing and then didn't even 
have subtitles and you're like what's the point of this? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, exactly. where the stories and Tales of the experience easy to read and understand 
 
Jessica   
yeah that I'm the guy what was it called 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Frank green 
 
Jessica   
He didn't seem like a nice person! have it was quite interesting to kind of his personality was 
very much reflective said in the materials that I was reading and it was it was quite amusing. 
And so I think the aspects of it was it was quite nice and then in kind of each of the rooms 
and stuff we tried to make like a person of interest in it so you had princess Victoria and and 
I was like the King's room and stuff like that. So that made it quite nice instead of just being 

469 
 
like here's here's another room isn't it's pretty kind of thing. Yeah, it's quite nice actually tried 
to make it a person of interest and how how the actual room would have been used when 
the house was in function. So I thought that was that was quite a nice thing and you can 
easily will relate to it because you're kind of putting it to kind of persons and stories and stuff. 
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So it's much more of a narrative stories rather than just 
 
Jessica   
Yeah, yes, actually. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right was the overall noise level appropriate? 
 
Jessica   
Yeah, I think in those kind of places anyway. Everyone's always speaking in in hushed 
tones. And so so that was quite enjoyable because what I found in different places and stuff 
when it when it is quite loud when you're trying to concentrate on being and stuff and you are 
finding it quite difficult so then have another kind of like annoyance in the background 
coming quite difficult so the fact that it was quite quiet when when we were there anyway but 
people you know do real always can speak in hushed tones that was that was quite all right 
yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah okay with any places that you thought it was too loud or echo-y or anything like that 
 
Jessica   
I guess like down in the basement area because obviously it is quite echo-y anyway and 
obviously it was like you had the tea room there as well and the shop and stuff so there is 
not actually going to be a lot more chapters there anywhere and obviously when you when 
you come in at the reception area that was obviously quite loud as well, but that's just 
because they're just their general areas. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there any places you thought were too quiet? 
 
Jessica   
No, not really, I don't think anywhere could really be too quiet in these types of places. So no 
I don't think that was anywhere that was too quiet.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Now lighting levels Okay, the fun one was the lighting level appropriate 
 
Jessica   
for me No. I mean it is tough for me because you obviously know why they don't have a lot 
of the natural light coming in because of conservation reasons and stuff. And but I you know 
there was I think that the type of lamps that they were using didn't help either so obviously 

470 
 
like It Wasn't that type of like bold It was quite like an orange one which doesn't give a lot of 
light anyway if you had like a like a light like that, that that does get quite a lot of light. But the 
other one the user could read both Yeah. Which was which made it look even dimmer to be 
honest. Yeah, and there was it couldn't imagine being in there in like peak winter. Yeah, like 
The guy who was speaking he was like us come three o'clock is just pitch black in here you 
can't see anything nevermind me what about for other people like that must be a quite a 
hard experience. But some rooms were better than other but that was just precisely because 
of the natural lighting that was available so if there was a bigger window, but generally I 
found it quite a dark place. Yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. I finished the audit and then yet because we got two more questions. So do you think 
any of the places were too bright? Um, 
 
Jessica   
I didn't think that they were Thank you Thank you so much. I think there were there were too 
light as such I think that when we went up into the top program and that was that was quite a 
light space but it was quite nice because the walls were quite liight and so with the text 
panels and actually kind of blended the room quite nicely together. And I think that if perhaps 
you had like a video in there for example because it's quite, quite bright it would be would 
have been struggling to see it. And I think that the fact that the left it just as text is quite nice 
actually. Okay. But there was like some cases because obviously in the in the dark rooms It 
was really dark in the middle and then it was really bright by the by the windows and then 
with the with the the text booklet that was in the shiny material because then that light was in 
kind of shining on it, it made it really well impossible to read it really bother with any of them. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay. So we're some places to dark. think I know the answer to that question, but go 
ahead.  
 
Jessica   
I think the worst room was in the king's room when it was all the whole room was red. And 
because obviously you've got a very dark kind of colors in the room. It just makes it 
completely dark. And they also the room when they had the ship in the middle of the ship 
that was really really dark. I just didn't really bother reading anything in there because it was 
just given me too much of a headache. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there enough places to sit and or rest? 
 
Jessica   
I think there was Yeah, it's in the I mean, not in obviously the actual house itself. There was 
a lot of chairs, obviously, you weren't allowed to sit on them. But when you went and the 
upstairs pause in the locker rooms, there was quite a lot of places to sit there.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. I did notice you sat down, not immediately in the one big bright room but I did notice 
that you sat down. Yeah. 
 
Jessica   

471 
 
Very interesting, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
because there's actually a chair in each room But I don't think they signpost them very 
clearly. At all. Yeah. So. All right. we've already gone over the fonts and the color contrast 
they're pretty much the same around the around the museum. And you think the stories and 
the tales in the sitting room were easy to read and understand. 
 
Jessica   
I really enjoyed the in depth panel once it's about the vases and stuff that was quite nice to 
to read. And then the theme panels there was a lot of mentioned about the the little like 
niches that was on the floor. That guy put down a little press and yeah, so then he knew that 
none of the furniture would be moved as yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
But that was honestly one of my favorite things about treasurer's house 
 
Jessica   
and that's when will I I remember kind of be in on the panel and I think there was some like 
other stuff about the actual room itself natural desperation and I don't think it was that 
engaging in that particular room but as I said the in depth panel was quite interesting and 
and they're not just on the floor was quite fun to look at. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. noise level, how was it?  
 
Jessica   
Yeah, it was. It was fine. I didn't particularly notice anything that was too loud or anything like 
that. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And lighting is that Yeah, 
 
Jessica   
so it was quite dark in that room because it was quite a big room. It has some windows but 
because it was quite big. It was quite hard to light up that room. Because the was a lot of 
windows, there was the ability to kind of go over to the windows to be able to kind of be able 
to read the panels and the text a bit clearer. But if it was like a busy day, for example, and it 
was quite busy, I probably would feel a bit too self conscious to do that. So I probably would 
have just skipped past that room if it was quite busy. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And he said something about how there they were trying to recreate how it would have 
looked like when Frank green was there, right. 
 
Jessica   
Yeah. So he mentioned about like, and what they what they would have done when the 
house was an operation is that they would have put like the candles and stuff by the mirrors 

472 
 
so he kind of made the room a bit lighter. And that's it. He said that's why they kind of had 
some of the the lamps and stuff in front of the in front of the mirror just to kind of mimic and 
what would have been done He said, That's why they don't have like overhead lights and 
stuff in there because we try to make it as authentic as possible. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you agree with it? 
 
Jessica   
Um, I mean, kind of Yes, in the sense that, you know, people do go to these kind of places 
because they want to kind of  step through history and stuff like that. And obviously, if you 
start putting a lot of modern additions in there, then it is obviously going to, to spoil the 
authentic feel of it. But I think that in that house in particular, it's just very, very dark. And I 
imagine that people would rather be able to see that not see at all so even the addition of 
just you know, some lighting I think not would wouldn't ought to be beneficial for me, but for 
you know, like, a lot of people because there's quite a lot of people You know, older people 
in there, the elderly, and I can't imagine that they have, you know, perfect 2020 is 
 
Ashley Fisher   
that is the National Trust main demographic? Yes, we're honest. Yeah. 
 
Jessica   
And so like if I went in there with my grandma, for example, I mean, I think that she would 
have definitely struggled to see because of the lighting itself. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there enough places to sit and or rest and sitting room? I don't.  
 
Jessica   
I don't recall seeing any seating in there to be honest. I mean, I think you could have sat on 
the windowsill, but I'm not sure if that was neat to see. Yeah, there were there were people 
sitting in one of the windowsills at one point, and they didn't get told off. So I guess it's okay. 
But yeah, it didn't really make it obvious. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, so one good thing and one bad thing about the museum in general. 
 
Jessica   
Okay. One good thing. I'm I really enjoyed the top room. And the exhibition, we had a fair 
talking about the kind of the loss of the many houses around Yorkshire and stuff. But that 
was quite interesting actually, I think that a lot of people would have kind of read that and 
kind of be like, okay, like, this is why these kind of places are important. And I thought that it 
was quite nice actually, to kind of round it all together. And kind of not as you think about the 
history itself, but the actual, you know, kind of overall theme of it and stuff and it was quite 
nice because it was quite light in that I quite enjoyed being in that room and also quite liked 
how on the wall they had kind of like all the list of all the houses and stuff like that, but that 
was a quite a nice way to do it. And I also quite enjoyed interacting with that wall in particular 
as well. 
 

473 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, one bad thing. About the museum in general. So 
 
Jessica   
I was said the lighting, definitely. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
One good thing related to accessibility about the museum 
 
Jessica   
is that it you did have the individual panels that you could pick up, you can kind of pick way 
which is quite nice for me because then I could put my overlay on it and not be embarrassed 
that people are trying to read it with me or anything like that. It was like my own little kind of 
panel for five minutes. I was having it. So that was quite nice actually. And it means that not 
everyone is kind of standing around one panel, people like to pick it up and then take it 
around the room with them. So that was quite nice, actually. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, one bad thing related to accessibility. 
 
Jessica   
And probably the lighting thing 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, did anybody jumped out at to jump out at 
 
Jessica   
you. Probably the lighting lighting again. Yeah. Probably the main thing Yeah. Because while 
the the panels you know that they were great and obviously sometimes were that they were 
laid out and made it quite hard to read and stuff like that book if the whole place was a little 
bit lighter, I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more. Because even though you know the 
actual text itself might have been hard to read at times, but that the aid of being able to see 
and stuff like that would have just made it a lot more easier and a lot more enjoyable and 
easier to engage. Yeah, I think the lighting was it was a huge kind of barrier in the place 
itself. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, were there any access tools that they provided that were helpful? 
 
Jessica   
I mean, I think the fact that the the panels were individual was was quite a helpful Access 
Tool. And I think that the, the video that we watched in the kitchen and that was quite nice to 
have been the fact that you had subtitles on it as well. Text to read and stuff was was quite 
nice and stuff like that, that helps me quite a lot engage. And also saying that the video 
downstairs as well in the basement and had headphones, and it had subtitles as well. That 
was quite nice. 
 
Ashley Fisher   

474 
 
Excellent. Do you think the museum could provide anything else to help? 
 
Jessica   
I think you kind of what you said and I'm thinking about it is the fact that if they had and kind 
of the panels on the website, you can perhaps download so obviously the perspective it 
needs to be dark in there of see if you have even phone and stuff like that and you can 
adjust the brightness to how you would like it you know if they had a downloadable guide 
and they kind of mentioned when you're in this room you read like this titles of someone that 
doesn't have to be in depth as the theme panels for example but the the other like in depth 
one and which was quite nice having the room that might be good to have as a as a website 
version. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What should the museum design into the exhibitions from the beginning to be more 
accessible? 
 
Jessica   
And I think that perhaps I'm kind of like two panels, okay, especially for me, for example, it 
was quite hard to kind of navigate my overlay and the heavy panels at the same time and 
stuff and I think that the doing quite good job ensuring that the panels aren't on pure white 
background, but I think that perhaps not having as much bold on the panels and maybe not 
italics, there is another, you know, there are other ways that you can emphasize quotations 
about being in italics and stuff like that. Yeah, definitely. And kind of the fact that I'm quite a 
bold writing on the other panels. Okay, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
so more around the design of the font suits and things like that. Okay. And obviously, you 
brought your overlay.  
 
Jessica   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
And used that. Now, it's okay to say one way or another, were you using it more often 
because I was there watching you, or is that about how often you use it? 
 
Jessica   
I think that's about how often I would use it. I think that in it. I was able to use a lot more 
because of the individual panels themselves. I've been in museums where it's obviously just 
on The wall and I don't really have the chance to use it. And I sometimes use it when I get 
getting guidebooks and stuff like that in museums. And I felt like I had to use a little bit more 
because of the lighting. And if it was a lot lighter in there, then I may have not used it at all. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How did staff make you feel?  
 
Jessica   
That's what they were. They were nice. And they were very friendly. Yeah, I don't really have 
any complaints about any of the stuff. They're good.  

475 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Good. do you think you would have been treated differently if your disability was physical? 
 
Jessica   
Yes, I can. Maybe not in a negative way. But I do feel for example, that they might have tried 
to help about being about asking about asking for help and things like that. I think that 
People are more prompt to say what is help here. You have a disability that you can see. 
Sure. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Interestingly, when we were in there one of the upper rooms, there's a gentleman that I think 
had Down syndrome. Coming consistently a room behind him. Yeah, yeah. And the person 
in that room was very good with Yeah, very patient. Very helpful. Yeah. 
 
Jessica   
Yeah. really engaged with him. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If you could tell the museum one thing regarding the accessibility of their site, what would it 
be 
 
Jessica   
and to make it more accessible into the lighting? Okay, I understand the reasons that they 
have done it but perhaps, I don't know. They would maybe want to make a make it known on 
the website or something that it is quite a dark place. And and kinda of, you know, provide 
kind of online resources that people can bring on their own devices. And I think get kind of 
maybe making people aware that it is quite a dark place. Sure. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right, that's all of my question. Yeah. So do you have anything else that you want to say 
about the museum? 
 
Jessica   
No, not really? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. 
7.4. Follow-up Interview. 
We met at a café in York on 25 October, 2019 to conduct this interview. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So I'm just going to go back over some of the things we talked about last time. Yeah. You 
came down quite hard on the lighting in, in treasurer’s house. You still feel that way? 
 
Jessica   

476 
 
I do, okay. I mean, it's quite coincidental that we're also in a place that doesn't have brilliant, 
but um, yeah, I was kind of thinking back on it today when I was driving home from work. 
And, you know, it definitely was a huge issue, I think, for me, and I think we were quite lucky 
that we were there to on quite a bright day as it was. Yeah. So I think that if we did go, you 
know, kind of more in the wintertime when there was kind of less light available anyway, I 
think that it would have been a lot more difficult to kind of engage with the material in the 
actual and the museum itself. All right. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
You said that the staff was amazing. 
 
Jessica   
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, this staff were really really nice. You know, when I asked where the 
toilet was, for example, because they kind of just say, Oh, it's just downstairs, it kind of went 
kind of above and beyond them and like, give like, the more detailed instructions and, and 
kind of the stuff that I saw interacting with the other visitors. They were really great, really 
knowledgeable the mentioning thing about the famous ghosts. And in the basement, and 
yeah, I thought yeah, the stuff were really nice.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
would you do you think they were a highlight of visiting there? 
 
Jessica   
I think yeah, I think because, in particular, you know, I wasn't really able to engage that well 
with the material. So it's great to know that you do have staff that you always want to kind of 
interact with, and still have a meaningful experience coming up to ask questions and get 
quite a lot of information from still Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. And you like the handheld panels? 
 
Jessica   
Yes. So I think positive of them was the fact that they were kind of my own personal panel I 
could use my an overlay on like, for example, if I'm in certain museums and heritage sites 
where it's just big panels, yeah, obviously everybody else is kind of around, you're looking at 
them, I don't really want to be kind of sticking my overlay on a on a panel that everybody 
else is looking at. So that was a definite big advantage. Yeah. Of kind of a not horrible 
situation. But it was kind of like the silver lining for most of that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. And you said you probably wouldn't visit the museum again. Is that? 
 
Jessica   
Yeah, I think because it was quite a typical experience for me. And I felt that if I went again, I 
probably wouldn't be able to have a meaningful experience. So I wouldn't I probably wouldn't 
visit there. Again, if I was interested in kind of finding out the information or probably do my 
own research, kind of maybe watch some videos and listen to some podcasts or something 
like that, rather than actually visiting the museum itself. Okay. 
 

477 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Did this museum remind you of any other museums that you visited? 
 
Jessica   
Um, it kind of it was very similar to Gawthorpe Hall in Burnely. And which is near from where 
I'm from. It's a very similar in terms of the lighting because the opposite was house that was 
actually lifted to the lighting is very much restricted, and it's kind of preserved, how it was 
lived in. Yeah, so basically. And so it was very, very similar to kind of that kind of visit that 
I've done. 
 
Jessica   
Previously in Burnley. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think that's a general issue with like, Manor homes and heritage sites like that? 
Yeah, 
 
Jessica   
I think, you know, they're all quite similar and you know, kind of like, Castle Howard is 
another kind of one, that does come to mind is that you're trying to protect It is found and so 
there's not really much way for kind of, you know, adding you know, modern features like 
lighting or perhaps panels that you know, kind of do have a fly or, or video stuff like that 
because we're not really able to kind of put that in. So in a so much lack in kind of the 
modern technology and additions that you might find in a museum, for example, that's been 
built to be a museum. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Are there any stellar museum experiences that stand out in your mind from places you've 
been in the past? So 
 
Jessica   
my favorite places in York is the Minster undercroft. Yes, okay. I do really enjoy that. Even 
though obviously, there's no natural light, there is quite a lot of artificial light, which I find to 
work quite well with my disability. And there's quite a lot of kind of different interactions 
there's videos there's kind of like build your own arch which I'm useless – I guess I'm and 
you're actually able to kind of engage and see the actual kind of like Roman road and the 
walls and stuff like that. And for me like that is kind of like what I compare everything to and 
it's probably one of the my favorite places to go. And another very good place that I've 
recently been to was in North Macedonia of all places, really, I went to the Holocaust 
Museum there. And it was spectacular. It was really really modern. A lot of money had been 
put into it. And, and the, you know, it just had a great array of different kinds of interactive 
panels, video, and headphones. had kind of you know, That you could interact there. And it 
was quite emotional. You kind of went into like carriages and stuff like that. And you were 
really it was very immersive. And I feel that for me, it wasn't it wasn't just kind of standing 
around reading, it was a lot of interaction, which is something I really enjoy things. I'm just 
going around reading, because I find it difficult to kind of read interactive panels as it is kind 
of being able to kind of do it in a different way. Sure, quite nice. So I another example that 
srings to mind is the Liverpool Maritime Museum. And they had a slavery exhibition. And that 
was exactly the same. It was very immersive, very interactive, you weren't just kind of stood 
around reading panels. You have been very much engaged and there was lots of videos and 
audio files and stuff like that. 

478 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
One of the things that I'm seeing sort of common throughout this is that there's lots of 
different ways that they're presenting information. Yeah, 
 
Jessica   
exactly. So it's not just one standardized way of it just being kind of interactive panels and 
the objects that see it kind of, you know, a very immersive you know, I find that I do kind of 
learn by kind of listening and kind of seeing and kind of like interacting and stuff like that, 
rather than just reading it. I'd rather listen to things and learn that way, rather than just 
reading a piece of paper.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Do you think there are different expectations put on paying versus non paying 
museums? 
 
Jessica   
Oh, that's interesting. I guess, in terms of, you know, on the funding side, yeah. If you're 
paying something You expect it to be good almost Yeah. You know, you're you're paying for 
a service. Well. If it is free kind of museum you know you do have your expectations are a lot 
lower because you're not paying for that service. So you're almost your you don't mind this is 
not as much of a engaging experience. Sure. Then if you're paying for it, because if I'm 
going to a museum and I'm paying 10 pounds to get in, and then I realized that I'm I am 
unable to engage with anything because they haven't you know, it's not really catered to my 
disability, yes, that I'm going to be but like, well, it's just pay 10 pounds to kind of come here 
and I'm not really having, you know a meaningful experience. You know, and if I'm paying 
then at least they should be able to have maybe an audio guide for me to use if I if I am 
paying like, if I go somewhere that's free. And I'm not that bothered if I am not been able to 
have meaningful experience and I have to kind of leave after a short amount of time because 
I haven't paid kind of thing, right?  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think that the treasures house would have been value for money basically.  
 
Jessica   
Um I think that if I paid, I'm probably not know. Because, you know, I didn't mean to have a 
meaningful experience and  If I am kind of paying for service, I might expect perhaps that be 
an audio guide or online resources that I can use around the museum itself be able to have 
a meaningful experience rather than just kind of reading off an interactive panels. Yeah. And 
I think on that side of things, I probably wouldn't be inclined to go Again, if I definitely knew 
that I had to pay, yeah, because I knew that I would have a meaningful experience. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, sure If we had taken this trip on a bad day, would it have changed anything? And 
what would that bad day be? Like? 
 
Jessica   
What you mean, my bad day? 
 

479 
 
Ashley Fisher   
 Um, well, for some people like arthritis flare ups, but I think it would be more of a very dark 
day. 
 
Jessica   
Yeah. So like a dark day, or perhaps I had a bit of a headache that day, for example. So I 
think, could you repeat the question? Sorry, yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
If we are taking this trip on a bad day, would it have changed anything? And 
 
Jessica   
I think probably not, no, because I think the experience on the outcome would still have been 
the same because I didn't have a meaningful experience. And I think that nothing could 
really affect that. I think even if it was, you know, a bright summer day and there was kind of, 
you know, a bit more life and I think that the light still would have not been enough. Yeah. 
And maybe for example, if I did have a headache, and I was finding it difficult to read more 
than I normally would, I might be inclined just to not bother reading anything at all. Yeah. But 
overall I say, on the whole, it doesn't really make much of a difference in general. I didn't 
really have a meaningful experience here.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
So it's, in general, a disappointing experience.  
 
Jessica   
Yes.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Fair enough. Now, this is probably my most invasive question, but do you consider 
yourself disabled? 
 
Jessica   
Um, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
there's no right or wrong way. What I'm very genuinely curious about  
 
Jessica   
I think that when I sit, I'm kind of look at that I say that because you know, on the disability 
spectrum, you know, I'm very, very, you know, mild. I know that a lot people who have you 
know, worse Irlen Syndrome a people have worse dyslexia than  I do, I feel like on the 
spectrum I kind of I feel like I don't have the right to say that I have a disability for definitely 
when you know for example when I was writing my my essays for my msterss you know I 
needed the disability help like I needed that so often in that case I did class myself as having 
a disability because kind of compare myself against my peers in my class. I very much could 
see that I had a disability. Yeah, but in kind of the the wider world. I mean, on job 
applications I don't put down that I have a disability because I didn't feel like it would affect 
my job that much and I feel like it is relevant for the job I do now is definitely not relevant at 
all. Like in my on my Word document I have my like, background- I do have my overlay 

480 
 
colour and I did I've had to tell my team leader, but when originally I was hired. I didn't feel 
like it was relevant. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Fair enough. Would you then say that you are a person with a disability or a disabled 
person?  
 
Jessica   
A person with a disability, I think. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
interesting to me, there's a lot of debate as to whether we should be saying disabled person 
or person with a disability. But it mostly affects people with visible disability. Yeah. And as 
I'm doing more of this research, it's becoming very clear to me that people with hidden 
disabilities don't identify as 
 
Jessica   
If I told somebody I have Irlen syndrome, I don't expect them to say you're disabled, I would 
expect them to say, Oh, so you have that disability. Yeah, I yeah, I would never kind of make 
that. Yeah, I would never say that I'm disabled. I said that I just have a disability. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Obviously, there's no research on this whatsoever,  so I'm finding it very, very interesting. 
Yeah.  
 
Jessica   
Because disabled is such like a like an overt term it's like characterizating That's who you all 
you would play with as you are a person with a disability kind of insinuating that you have a 
lot more layers to you, you are a person that does have a disability. But there's more to you 
than Yeah, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah. It's very, very interesting because, for example, people who use wheelchairs, they 
very much identify as a disabled person because, yes, there's other layers to them, but 
everything is touched by the fact that he is a wheelchair. Yeah. But, you know, with dyslexia, 
that doesn't necessarily mean everything about you is touched by it. Yeah. You know, 
exactly. Yeah. Very interesting. 
8. Kasi & Teagan. 
Kasi and Teagan are women and sisters. Teagan has dyslexia and EDS. Kasi has ADHD, 
dyslexia, dyspraxia, and EDS. 
8.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met Kasi and Teagan at Teagan’s home to conduct this interview on 31 May, 2019. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So you guys know what my research is?  

481 
 
 
Teagan   
Correct. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Have I explained to you what it is? So I'm looking at people with hidden disabilities, and how 
museums can better make their museums accessible for them. So First things first is the 
consent forms. I have copies. I know you sent them to me, but here's a paper copy, go 
ahead. Fill those out, here you go. Three different meetings that we’ll be doing in regards to 
this. This is the first one, and on Sunday, we're going to have our actual trip to Abbey House 
Museum in Leeds, and then there'll be one sometime next week, thinking about Monday. 
Very flexible when it happens. Just as a sort of follow up session. 
 
Teagan   
(sounds of agreement as they fill out the forms) 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Alright, Can I get your signature there? That's fine. (giving the date) 31st. Do guys have any 
questions? Before we get started? Okay, that's fine.  So today, we're going to go through a 
couple different things. One is, you know, your pre visit research, and what do you guys look 
at and things like that? And then I'm going to have you walk me through how you get ready 
on the day to go somewhere, just to see what it is. I have a couple questions for you Before 
we get started. So we have gotten started. But still. These questions are in regards to your 
disability, so you are absolutely free to tell me no, I don't want to answer that.  All right. So 
you guys have something called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, is that correct? Yes, I've done 
some research on that. But can you guys tell me in your own words, how those, what they 
are and how they affect your everyday life.  
 
Teagan   
So Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a connectivity problem, specifically it means that my body 
does not correctly create collagen, so it can affect every connectivity tissue – connection in 
your body, from eyes, joints, digestion issues, hearts and everything like that. The specific 
type that we have is the hypermobility type. Of the different types, it tends to be the most 
benign, but it can also cause a lot of issues. One of the problems with it is that just because 
you're feeling good one day doesn't mean that you will continue to feel good the entire day 
or tomorrow, regardless of what you're doing. You can do something as simple as taking a 
step like I did today, and I sublaxed my knee. And my kneecaps are currently in the incorrect 
place, and there's something underneath, which makes it feel very strange. Okay, So in 
addition to that, with me, it means it also affects my digestion, so I cannot eat red meat. This 
is not typically come up as an issue Very often. But it does mean that every once in a while, 
we'll probably need to sit as we're going around the museum. In addition Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome, a common problem that is associated with this is a thing that's called POTS. 
Which the long name for it is like, Let me look it up real quick. (muttering as she uses her 
phone to look up the full name) It's postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Basically, your heart changes your heart rate changes based on how you're sitting, or 
what position you're in.  
 
Teagan   

482 
 
What position you're in. Yeah, it's the strange thing about it is... an easy way to say it is if 
you stand up too quickly, you pass out. Because your blood flow doesn't go very well. But 
what it primarily affects us is we can't stand in one place for too long. Because by not 
standing, it actually causes our heart rate to decrease, which then increases the blood flow 
rate, which causes us to get lightheaded and that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have 
anything else to add on that Kasi? 
 
Kasi   
On the EDS thing? I walked a bit too fast yesterday, and I pulled the back of my le.g. Okay. 
That's fine. Okay. 
 
Teagan   
Why don't you talk about more the hidden disabilities parts since yours is more significant? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah and then you also have dyspraxia, is that correct? 
 
Teagan   
Where you keep on running into things. Okay. 
 
Kasi   
Yeah, I also have ADHD. Okay. But I tend to not act out as much. Sure.  
 
Teagan   
It's gotten better. But I think that's because she doses herself caffeine which helps in that 
regard.  
 
Kasi   
It's mostly just a focusing problem, I struggle. Even If I'm really engaged in a conversation, I 
can get distracted. I can end up spacing off, I have been to a lot. And It's very annoying, 
especially if it's during class. And I'm like, Hi. We're having a test review. Few minutes later, 
class is over? Oh okay. Yeah.  When it comes to dyslexia. It's all a processing thing. 
Whether it comes to writing something down reading something, or just that first like, 
comprehension of a word can be pretty hard. 
 
Teagan   
As you know by my unfortunate handwriting. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I love it. Don't feel that I might laugh, but genuinely, The bright spark my day. 
 
Kasi   
And it can be hard for me to understand what it is I'm reading, especially if I don't hear it 
verbally. Sure. I can read a paragraph and nothing has been retained. Yeah. And it can be 
hard with understanding how things are pronounced. Yeah. Ups. 
 
Teagan   

483 
 
I think my my best example, was fatigue. So I just assumed most video games there was 
this magical thing was magical or called "fat-i-gew". So I realised one day was 
 
Kasi   
Drawer. I had not realised it was spelled draw-er. Yep. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. 
 
Kasi   
I just lose letters. Okay, And I have to mixed stuff up. I have also mixed up numbers for 
letters. Fours and Rs, of course, for some reason. Okay. Gs and sixes.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, I can see that.  
 
Kasi   
Spatial processing thing. I get lost very easy. 
 
Teagan   
This is how you got lost in Alaska. 
 
Kasi   
I did. I am not very good at judging distance. Which is a problem when Driving. Yeah. 
Especially with stoplights that are further away than the line is that that is it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Which is horrendous in this country. 
 
Kasi   
Rights and lefts. Like, I don't know which one is the right one. What I'm staring at it. They're 
not there yet. I also can't retain directions ever. Okay. Yeah, Give me one of those like 
instructions like turn right here. And then left and right and left. It's like I'll remember turn 
right? Maybe 
 
Teagan   
That's why I like when museums use the colour coded maps that corresponds with the area. 
I just look up and ah, I'm in the red area on the map.  
 
Kasi   
But I also have a tendency to, I will look at something. And If I'm walking, I have no 
awareness of where I'm walking, I got lost in Alaska that way. Also run into things that way. 
And fall when I trip over, Okay? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, It's gonna be so much fun going to the abbey house museums guy,  
 

484 
 
Kasi   
you're gonna see me grab onto her arm. And I'm looking at something. 
 
Teagan   
She grabs onto someone's arm so she can look around.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's, that's all I had for this section. So we have hang out. So like I said, I'm going to be 
doing a couple things now. But first, I have little activity. Because during these observation, I 
can look at you guys all I want, But I want to know what you're thinking. So This is something 
called the think aloud verticals. And this is just going to help you verbalise your thoughts 
more easily. You're going to feel really silly doing it the entire time. But That's okay.  
 
(think aloud protocols practice – lots of overlapping voices) 
 
I'm gonna have you guys walk me through your pre trip research. So how you find out what 
you need to find out for a visit to 
 
Kasi   
I trust Teagan to take care of it. We have similar problems. So I assume she thinks about it.  
 
Teagan   
[First checks museum's website] first thing I was looking was what time they're open, Okay. I 
tend to look up and see if I can see an overall map. Not really about access. They're not 
 
Kasi   
looking I look at born in America, I went there is how would I feel to get there?  Would I have 
to walk there? Transportation. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure, yeah. Yeah. 
 
Teagan   
Actually, that's true. Stuff like knowing where we were going to, so google that stuff and see 
where it's located on the map. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, and what websites do you use to figure that out. Google Maps? 
 
Teagan   
Google Maps. Okay. I was just wondering where it's physically located.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
So first, you would sort of chart out a path to see, 
 
Teagan   

485 
 
Yeah, I kind of I would literally go on to Google Maps. typically, if I was to just look in the 
area, I would pull up and see what's the closest, easiest route to get there. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
makes a lot more sense that you don't do a pre trip research. It takes a lot more sense. In 
my head. I was like, how can you about plan everything to within an inch of his life? Okay, 
actually, that makes sense now.  
 
Teagan   
I'm gonna pull it up on transport. Yes. And there is a bus that conveniently goes directly to 
there. If I was feeling particularly good on a day I might consider walk into a location. I've 
done that with the Rowntree Park,, the National Trust house that was here Afterwards [I felt 
awful]. But I still did it. I look at accessible area. The access portion of their website is 
convenient in the sense that it does tell me how close it is to the city centre. It doesn't say 
the bus route on the first thing I would have thought it would, It just says it's located off the 
Abbey walk road. from a short but steep hill, and it says for parking. But I would have 
assumed that anyone needs to take a bus. 
 
Kasi   
something I was currently when I get there is an area to rest. it will be hard to... I'll rest 
against a wall. But yes, yeah, or 
 
Teagan   
Or café. This is one of the nice things about us. And the US, whenever you look up these 
types of things, the maps tend to be quite... quite useful. Because then you then basically all 
the information like all this information was nice, But but read you can read a map so you 
can visually way just so you can see like, was just a general. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so what are you looking for? 
 
Teagan   
I'm still looking for a map just to see if they're gonna have one. No. I don't think they're going 
to be honest. I think they're just gonna want me to read words. The access page? I mean, it 
basically it does have accessible toilets. But that doesn't really matter to us as much as 
 
Ashley Fisher   
well. Yeah. The accessible toilet is, you know at one end of the museum. And you're all the 
way on the other. That's not super helpful. 
 
Teagan   
It's just telling me what facilities are in the toilets, which is really all that important to me. No 
idea what a changing places facility it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So changing places facility is for people with more severe mobility needs. Yeah.  
 
Teagan   

486 
 
To be honest, I don't just assume that they had one of those. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Still looking for a map on there? 
 
Teagan   
Yeah, now I'm looking in general. So what they're going to be showing, since it doesn't look 
like there's gonna be a map on here that shows the basic of what it is and what the layout is. 
They have a physical location, which when I clicked on, Which led to just saying this family 
friendly and it has wheelchair access, which it already said in other places. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
You think it's helpful to have that information in multiple places? Or is it just redundant at that 
point? 
 
Teagan   
I mean, it is useful in a sense, that if you just want to click and see what's on I think this is a 
different website. Yeah, so I like to see what's on at the abbey museum,  it took me to a 
different site. It does feel like it's a bit piecemeal in the sense that the information that it has 
in the access all areas is not as complete as would have been useful. Just, It would have 
been nice to have the public transportation in addition to walk by car. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, it'd be nice to have basically all the information on that page. 
 
Teagan   
It also doesn't say.. I'm having a hard time finding like what type of things it actually has. So 
other times by looking at the page, they are showing at the main idea of... like Wow, Look, if 
they cater towards artists, I Expect the artists to be able to sit, like on a chair you can then 
take around the museum with you in different rooms, handle different art. They don't always 
list that they've got chairs, Sometimes you have to kind of read between the lines yet. 
Actually, I mean, that one picture of the example of the street was the public places you can 
sit But that doesn't really matter too much. Assuming it's not the size of the British museum. 
Back to the café. Yeah. Okay. So the things we'll have to find out as soon as we get there, 
We'll have to get a feel for how large the museum is to get an idea for how long we can go, 
Just in case they don't have seating. Alright, even if we can't finish the entire museum, we 
can see a bit just like walking through the end to quickly make our way today. So basically 
just need to get a feel for how the museum is setup, the location of the toilet and café.  
 
Kasi   
bathroom. 
 
Teagan   
Yes. That'll probably be one of the first things that you go and use.  
 
Kasi   
Probably the last thing I use too. I don't want to go on a public transport [without doing that]. 
 

487 
 
Ashley Fisher   
On the subject of public transport, will you do that Right now or on the day? 
 
Teagan   
No I plan it now. That's the thing that I tend to always plan out how to get there beforehand. 
Okay, once because of the lacklustre response to have on websites I tend to... If I can't find 
what I want, it does have an effect on if I want to go to a place. Because If I can't guarantee 
that they'll have a toilet or place that we can go and sit than I know what I can't spend a 
whole day there. Looks like it would take us about an hour and a half to get there. 13 
minutes on the bus to get to the station. 30 minutes on the train and 15 minutes on the other 
bus. I buy bus [tickets] the day of but I almost always buy trains early. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. What website do you use? Or app or whatever. 
 
Teagan   
I tend to go with whatever the station is. Yeah, I just tend to go with Because I look it up on 
Google. First, I see what the main train operator is.  
 
Kasi   
Because I rely solely on a car. I always make sure I know where it is and stuff like that. And 
do I want to park in this area. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. All right. I notice that you are using your tablet. Are there any specific tools on 
your tablet that you use? Screen reader kind of thing. 
 
Teagan   
I find that if I turn off the blue Light that actually makes it quite a bit easier to just read in 
general. But I actually don't have the same problem with tablets and stuff as I do with 
traditional media. White Paper with like black text tends to be much harder to read a white 
background on tablet which isn't pure white.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure.  
 
Kasi   
I find that black background, white text is easier. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
You, Kasi, come and walk me through how you would get ready On a day. Walk me through 
everything. This will be very weird. Okay. 
 
Kasi   
First I'll Try not to die on the steps. Okay. I fell down on the day I got here. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent.  

488 
 
 
Kasi   
So I Get up. I probably immediately get dressed. Okay, just get a bag, right? I want to make 
sure I have water. I get dehydrated a lot. Might also have to do with going to the bathroom a 
lot. I have my phone, maybe headphones. I take a pad of paper with me. If I need to write 
something for any reason. Sure. I go to the bathroom. Just brush my teeth, brush my hair. 
But I get the bag. Probably grab breakfast. 
 
Teagan   
I tend to like to try and get to museums first thing in the morning because they tend to be 
less crowded, so it's easier to get to, it's easier to get around, especially with a pushchair. So 
given that it opens at 10, it's an hour and a half to get there. We would like to grab food that 
we eat on the way. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. 
 
Kasi   
So than I wouldn't eat breakfast here. So then I'd sit here, Maybe have something to 
drink.  When it's time to go, I'd probably go to the bathroom one more time. 
 
Teagan   
Yeah, yeah, man, just depending on how you're feeling that day depends on whether or not 
Some kind of mobility aid or not. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, What kind of things do you have for that? 
 
Teagan   
The primary thing that I keep, that I have on hand tends to be wrist braces or ankle braces. 
Wrist braces are not likely something that we would need.  
 
Kasi   
Unless I thought I would have to be holding something like just anything more, then I'd have 
[them]. 
 
Teagan   
Yeah, if I like hurt my ankle or something, I'd take my ankle brace. I used to have knee 
braces.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I'm going to take a couple pictures of that. Okay. 
 
Teagan   
[demonstrating ankle braces] I've got one for each foot.  
 
Ashley Fisher   

489 
 
Interestingly, this is roughly how you tape an ankle to prevent ankle sprains in sports 
medicine. That's basically a reusable taped ankle. And they just sort of keep your... 
 
Kasi   
This part's hard. So It doesn't allow me to It's prevents me from hyper extending my wrist. 
that's mostly what the purpose of... 
 
Teagan   
our joints. So my.. most of her fingers hyper extend. mine don't too much except for like, 
these joints here. But luckily these don't Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Okay. 
 
Teagan   
She's getting ring braces to help with that? They have to be custom-made for your fingers, 
right. But Yeah, my problem tends to be with this thumb? Yeah. Check. That one. So that 
brace can actually help by relaxing These muscles. Okay, so that way, if this one gets 
offered up, There are ones that you can get specifically, but to know, Yeah, I tend to not use 
those because I find them annoying. But I am potentially going to get a ring brace for this 
particular joint, I do find that I have a problem of when I work. I'll just go like this. And that. 
OK. 
 
Kasi   
Especially my wrist. Sometimes by choice, but because mostly because the thing with my 
wrists is I paint and draw a lot. So It's a lot of this kind of thing or holding weird positions with 
this giant canvas. And that very quickly will hurt my wrist. These things like Oh, I need to do 
like a thing. It's like my hand. Well, yeah. Okay. And I get oil paint on it. And I like... oh... that 
later. Yeah. 
 
Teagan   
I, judging by the amount of walking we're going to do also really depends on what shoes I 
will wear. Because I have a very heavy duty pair of shoes, which provide some support – the 
insoles naturally provide support to your arches. Okay, So I have that in the sense that this 
joint on my right foot subluxes a lot. So if we do a lot of walking, even though I love wearing 
sandals, But also, because the connexion in my feet are so loose,  Here And here will slide 
out of place. And that's not very comfortable.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Oh, no, I can't imagine. 
 
Teagan   
I'm actually gonna see an orthopedic person about that.  
 
Kasi   
I don't have those problems per se. I can't wear flip flops, because my skin is very sensitive.  
 
Teagan   

490 
 
That's another [EDS thing.] 
 
Kasi   
Yeah. It's also possible I just have baby skin. My shoes are high tops. the ones that go.. 
Yeah, Yeah, they go up to the ankle. I don't think I'm actually having problems with my ankle. 
 
Teagan   
It could actually be subluxing your ankle. But if you're only loosening it up right to the middle 
of your ankle, You can actually start pushing them apart because of how you lace it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So they lace it up all the way  
 
Kasi   
I do. 
 
Teagan   
But You also need to make sure you don't get too tight or otherwise. 
 
Kasi   
That will rub my ankle off. So I have to wear socks that go past where it is because I will rub 
my skin raw. So supports in there, which are going to make sure I don't get flat footed. But 
will also attempt to make a pain in my hips go away. They were.. also apparently one of my 
legs is just like, tiny bit shorter than the other. But I don't think that was addressed in that. So 
I 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Just stick an extra couple of tissues. 
 
Kasi   
My shoes aren't tight. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So it's finding the right balance between too tight and too loose.  
 
Kasi   
Yeah, because I have to wear shoe sizes that are bigger than mine. Any pressure on my 
feet. So I have to wear something that fits but it has to be enough enough so there's no 
pressure on my feet. Because that will it will just make my feet ache. Alright. I'm think I'm 
what size seven? Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's pretty small feet given your height. 
 
Kasi   

491 
 
So I don't really have much of a I don't have as many problems as Teagan does with feet. 
But like, sometimes my knee will just give out. It's not like it slips like Teagan's does, like a 
nerve pinches or something. Or might have 
 
Teagan   
Some nerve tissue  
 
Kasi   
Yeah, it just can't put pressure on it's very painful. 
 
Teagan   
But it tends to be something you just kind of have to do the wrong way, you sit down. But it's 
variable about time for how long it'll take to rebound. 
 
Kasi   
I do know that. Like if I just like oh, I'll just push through it. no it just gets worse. Yeah, You 
can't push. 
 
Teagan   
You know, something we've been considering is looking into buying some mobility aids. It 
doesn't, it doesn't happen often enough for me to found it worth it to own a cane. I've used to 
have one when I lived in the States. I didn't need a very often so I didn't think it was worth it 
to come here. But my right hip gives me trouble sometimes. The other problem with all of 
that stuff I found is just especially like our mom, who has not been diagnosed, likely has EDS 
Also, She got a number of slip discs and her back, which caused her mobility to decrease 
significantly. So One of the things that we really needed to get for her was a cane that has a 
seat on it. But they're all aimed at really really old people. So you get one custom made. 
Yeah. Yeah. And So trying to get one that would look nice. But have both functions. It's quite 
difficult. But If I do go the route of getting a cane, probably end up being one of those. But 
that will something I purchase in the next 5 years. 
 
Kasi   
Another thing, Like all the leg get swollen, and like skin becomes really sensitive to your 
clothes 
 
Teagan   
Still have to be because of the EDS. You're thinking of combination of things that's likely 
could also be POTS but from the is what the heat rush when you get this swelling in your 
hands and stuff tends to be quite a time. 
 
Kasi   
Whatever The leg thing is, if I walk too fast, My legs will start to become like inflamed. And 
it's like it's like the rubbing raw thing again, like with my pants, it can be in tights, it can be 
shorts, It was just my skin. heated and marbling. My, I think I have part of it. It's the 
connective tissue in my veins, more like that. blood flow is bad. So If I'm walking too fast, It 
means like, it's having trouble. It's like pulling my leg or something I don't know. Sorry. Like 
they become like, essentially swollen and like hot. And it can be hard to move especially 
because my hands have been hurting. And I do have trouble with my hands which a small 
friend of mine For a while, but it was connected to being dehydrated, which it kind of is but it 
also just happens. My fingers will swell to the point I can't close my hand. 

492 
 
 
Teagan   
Yeah, I found that happens more often with heat. But there is not actually a correlation that I 
find just as likely to happen during the summer as it is in the winter. 
 
Kasi   
Yeah, I thought it had to do with touching metal. I thought I was allergic metal for a while. But 
it will just happen. randomise. See, my thing is like I was at the bookstore a week ago. For 
some reason, my right  hand completely swelled up. I had just been standing there like I 
have my hands down. I have a trouble. I think it's the whole blood flow thing again, my arms 
will start turning now. And then my hand swelled up. Like That's weird. Okay, just can't hold 
a book now in this hand. So weird.  
 
Teagan   
so awkward, especially if you're walking by yourself. And just like I awkwardly, just like keep 
on adjusting my collar.  
 
Kasi   
I feel like the circulation cut off under my arms. So I'll tend to slow it. but then I run the risk of 
Over extending my shoulder. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So we've gone through Kasi's morning routine. Now you get to take me through. I need to 
find out the stuff that has to do with Annora to because this is temporary accessibility issue. 
 
Teagan   
So I can just going to say... Okay, fantastic. So basically what happens is Annora wakes up 
some ungodly hour I grab her and I feed her. And normally she goes back to sleep, She will 
then wake up sometime between 630 and 730 and decided she  no longer wants to go back 
to sleep. I am quite slow to wake up in the morning because I tend to need to allow my blood 
flow to normalise. Because If I go from a heavy sleep to suddenly standing up very quickly, 
My blood has not reached my brain yet. And I can black out. So I need a few minutes to just 
become alive. So What will typically happen is Brennen will take her and do the first morning 
change. he'll either get her into the day's outfit, or he'll bring her back in here to get the days 
out. And then I will go and I will get dressed After checking the weather to see like what 
temperature it is. Because the poor circulation that I have, I tend to get cold Very, very 
easily. So I always tend to dress warmer, sometimes even warmer than I dress my baby 
Because I don't want to overheat her. She gets very cranky if she gets too hot, and she's... 
And then we will go downstairs and I will start getting everyone ready to eat she tends to eat 
Weetabix. For breakfast. I have a hard time with breakfast because that tends to be where 
my digestion is the most picky. And I think it's because it emptied out. And So now it's 
putting stuff on to a. So I tend to try and avoid wheat in the morning, just as a general thing. 
So What I typically have is coconut yoghurt. Because I can't have dairy right now with 
Annora because she's lactose intolerant. So it's So it's yoghurt, made with coconut milk, 
instead of cow's milk. Mixed with frozen berries, almond flakes, cinnamon, and sesame 
seed, sesame seeds. And occasionally raisins and peanut butter, nice little protein boost. 
And then we try and make sure that we're completely ready before we get her ready 
because she tends to get fussy. So while one of us is feeding her, The other one typically 
then goes and make sure that her pack is fully stocked. Technically, I restock at the end of 
the day. So that way I know like immediately what I need to do, I try to check. Before we go 
out to just to make sure that I haven't forgot to get back to like diapers, You have to make 

493 
 
sure we have enough diapers to make sure that the wipes are existed. If I'm running low to 
put a second one of those, She needs at least two changes clothing. Because baby, And 
you never know. And then she also needs some burp rags. She's old enough now that she 
doesn't really spit up very much. She still she really likes to try and feed herself but she does 
not have the coordination to feed herself. So we do need the ability to clean ourselves up, 
should anything happen. And then I also try and make sure that there are snacks and stuff 
for her. If I am exceptionally forward thinking I will try and put a snack on myself. However, 
that requires me of forward thinking when I was shopping. So that doesn't happen as often 
as it does, it tends to me that I tend to buy more specs at the place Because I don't often 
have problems for blood sugar. But every once in a while I'll just if my blood pressure drops 
too much then eating something will balance it out. I'm trying to put like one toy in there-  she 
tends to get just like people watching so she doesn't really need a toy. But sometimes it's 
nice to distract her while we're waiting for food to show up. And that she basically just needs 
socks, shoes, trousers, shirt, And some kind of hat or a cap. Too much Really cool for 
anyone. And then if my husband is coming with us, We will bring the baby carrier she's now 
too heavy for me to carry in the baby carrier. So I take her in the push chair everywhere We 
have nice jogging pushchair so that way I could take a nice full steps and not need to worry 
about me kicking and potentially damaging my feet trying to push the stroller. And then also I 
don't have a tonne of vibrations, killing my joints  
 
Kasi   
Oh yeah the carts, the shopping carts can my hand swell up very fast you  
 
Teagan   
I love the carts in this country they so much nicer than they are in America.  I don't know 
why. people take care of their carts better? And then I will then check public transportation 
on the phone. Since the six is right there. I have the first app on my phone so I can see 
When they're coming, I'm going to try and leave the house where they are within five 
minutes of appearing. And then we'll leave otherwise we'll just like kill time, distract her.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. That's all I have for this time. Do you guys have any questions about this? 
Anything else you want to mention? 
 
Kasi   
You're gonna be talking to us? Or are you just going to be silently stalking us? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
We'll see how the day goes. For the trip I'm planning on being side by side with you, not 
standing back and watching. I will be taking notes every now and then. Good job. Don't let 
that intimidate you. Because it might just be something that caught my eye and it was really 
cool. And I want to do it somewhere else. For the visit itself, you guys are going to be leading 
it, there's a couple things I want to make sure that we hit. There's one exhibition that I want 
to make sure we go to the same exhibition, so that everyone is going to be having a point of 
comparison. We're going to check the toilets, which obviously won't be a problem Now. 
Okay, and I want you to ask for help  from a staff member. 
8.2. Site Visit. 
I met Kasi and Teagan at Teagan’s home, then journeyed with them to Abbey House 
Museum and back. This trip took place on 2 June, 2019. 

494 
 
 
[all three of us pay admission, the staff member then directs us to a gate to the side of the 
entrace corridor 
 
Staff member   
[On radio] Three headed your way. 
 
[we're let in the accessible way, which avoids two stairs and takes us straight into the 
Victorian Street exhibition] 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thank you. 
 
Staff member   
Just to give you a few more tips like that [she gives us a bit of an overview about the gallery, 
and lets us know that if we have any questions, feel free to ask her]. 
 
- 
 
Teagan   
[suggestion we go to the café] Wait there for 30 minutes and then... dragging. 'Cause she's 
not really settling. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
[sounds of us making our way to the front of the exhibition] 
 
Teagan   
If we pop into the café and we come back and...? 
 
Staff member   
You can come in as many times as you like during the day. We just have a cutoff point. I'll 
just be a moment. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So what do you think of the museum so far? 
 
Kasi   
It's interesting. That it's displayed like a street. I wasn't expecting that. You were right about 
it having nothing to do with the Abbey.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Absolutely nothing. 
 
Kasi   

495 
 
I wish they had the labels of things . Okay. Yes. Just because I don't know what a lot of 
things are. But that might just be because I'm American. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I think a lot of people coming here don't know what a lot of these things are. Okay. 
 
Kasi   
And it's great if they have someone talking, but there's only one. And if theres a bunch of 
people.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
And clearly there's at least two groups in there right now. So us and that other groups,  
 
Kasi   
so it seems like that could be a stressful job. Yes, yes. Okay.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
No, I think you're... I think they rely very heavily on the person in that room to provide the 
interpretation. Yeah. Which is, has its strengths and weaknesses.  
 
Kasi   
Yeah, I mean, it's okay. If it was like, more than one. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Would you feel comfortable going and asking her what something was?  
 
Kasi   
She was very nice. Okay, so yeah, I probably would be fine. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
That is like 75% of the battle, making sure that the room guides are approachable. Yeah. 
 
- 
 
Ashley Fisher   
so finding the museum would you say it's easy to find from the street  
 
Teagan   
Yep. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was the signage easy to see? 
 
Teagan   
It was easy to see what tickets I'd need to get. 
 

496 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yep.  Was it easy to find the entrance? 
 
Teagan   
Well I almost went to the café but then I saw there were steps and stuff, so I was like "ahh... 
that's where I need to go." 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there any barriers to getting inside like stairs, heavy doors? 
 
[a pause, no answer from Teagan or Kasi] I mean, the shop was a nightmare to get around 
but 
 
Teagan   
I didn't think it would be quite that bad. like if I had anything wider than that [points to the 
pushchair] I wouldn't be able to get around. 
 
Kasi   
I didn't realize the entrance to the area, that little gate thing. I thought  that it was a barrier. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
technically the actual entrance to that exhibition is a little- it's the one that she led us out of? 
So we miss the information table that explains some of the things. 
 
Kasi   
Yeah. 
 
Teagan   
Yeah. Because I think you have to go up some stairs. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
There's stairs, I think, to get to that point. Yeah. But why not just have everyone go that 
way? Anyway, it's things like this that aggravate me. The interactions with the staff so far. 
Yes. 
 
Teagan   
It was quite helpful. So yeah, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I was asking Kasi we were talking about how there's not much written interpretation in that 
exhibit. So it's very reliant on the person that's in there. Would you feel comfortable asking 
that person asking her for information on the spot 
 
Teagan   
Yeah that lady's fine. She was quite personable. 
 

497 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What do you think of that the Victorian street exhibition that we saw so far? 
 
Teagan   
It's quite similar to one that I saw at a Ren Faire [renaissance faire]. A pop up one that they 
had at [name of Ren Faire] 
 
- 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you like that? It was a more immersive experience on that street? 
 
Kasi   
The street was cool. Yeah, the exhibits themselves didn't seem like they had a lot of room 
for the stuff they had set up there. Kitchen stuff is piled. Yeah. It's probably a lot more than a 
house.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
There's just too much. 
 
Teagan   
it was immersive on the other hand. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So you like the immersive quality of it? It seemed like they might have volunteers. Just by 
the setup and what I know at the castle museum it seemed like they might have volunteers 
that come in and you know man a shop.  
 
Kasi   
Yeah, that'd be cool.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. I know the Castle Museum does and it's very cool  
 
Teagan   
I liked the dress up stuff, except when someone's fussy [referring to the baby]. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I saw you guys flipping through the little haberdashery booklet. Were you reading it? Were 
you just looking at the pictures?  
 
Kasi   
I was looking at pictures. It was also noticing it was really hard to go through.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. 

498 
 
 
Kasi   
Especially if you had one hand there's no yeah. We didn't bother reading the font it's kind of 
difficult. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Fair enough. Yeah.  
 
Teagan   
I mean, it was convenient but uh.. but I would have rather been able to like go sit down or 
something like that. But I would have actually read it if I could sat down, yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I didn't notice any seating areas in that first section. At least  
 
Teagan   
there is in the haberdashery for that  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, there was a bench in there. I mean, there were the toilet seats that second street 
 
Teagan   
Yeah, I suppose you could sit on those. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
but I'm not sure you don't want to. Whenever I'm in exhibitions like that, it always feels to me 
like they're just trying to put as many objects from their storage on display as possible and 
not really caring whether or not people understand what they are that's always what it seems 
like some it's just a lot of clutter and it's not very clear to me if that's how it was or that's just 
them trying to display a whole bunch of really cool objects. 
 
Teagan   
I just assumed it was cool. 
 
Kasi   
Teagan, do you remember going to the King Tut museum? I thought that some of that was 
laid out pretty well. But it was a portable museum so they had to didn't have too much stuff. 
It was divided in like districts, this district is this section is the- biggest the one that was like 
the sex district.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Oh, okay. 
 
Kasi   
Interesting bits of art there. 
 

499 
 
Teagan   
It wasn't King Tut, it was Pompeii. It was- Yeah, it was the Pompeii exhibition. They had a 
travelling Pompeii exhibit close to the Getty [a museum in America] so that's probably that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What did you think of the layout of that? Victorian street? 
 
Teagan   
There was two steps to have actually get into the exhibit so it was completely stuff that we're 
accessing where to get back into where the seating area was. Yeah.  
 
Kasi   
I was kind of confused where we moved on. Yeah, so that was through the stores and that 
was like it. Which I mean granted it was authentic to the Victorian era. 
 
Teagan   
Authenticity versus accessibility.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Do you think it was too dark or too light in that area.  
 
Kasi   
It was a bit dark 
 
Teagan   
the lighting was fine except for when they added additional light it was too bright. Okay, 
because then made everything else seems darker because you suddenly don't... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
You realize you had the con[trast]. 
 
Teagan   
OK, so the lighting needs to be angled differently so that way you don't look directly into it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, that makes everything else.... yeah, 
 
Teagan   
yeah. So I think they just need to angle the lights differently.  
 
Kasi   
Yeah, like you walked in, turned around immediately blinded. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Well, even walking out there was no way to avoid looking at least almost into that spotlight.  
 

500 
 
Teagan   
Which is not good when you add it to that step. 
 
Kasi   
And the computer thing didn't work 
 
Ashley Fisher   
The computer thing didn't work. It wasn't clear how it was supposed to work. 
 
Kasi   
I tried swiping left nothing happened – yeah nothing happened. Did it really exaggerated? 
And then it delayed it, slowly Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
When we have our café chat I have a worksheet for you guys as a simplified version of all 
these questions. Because you don't need to answer every single one of them. 
 
for level access to the museum. Yeah. Oooo who wants stickers? Everybody wants stickers. 
Excellent. And one for [baby] too! 
 
Ashley Fisher   
so lighting in here do you think it's been ok? 
 
Teagan   
The lighting in this whole pub is better.   
 
Ashley Fisher   
Ok. 
 
Teagan   
Because the lights are covered Yes. So you're not staring directly into them.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
They're there. diffusing the light better. 
 
Kasi   
[reading aloud] gross, grocer... "Refrigeration before people have..." it's a bit hard to read. 
Yeah, little hard to read. "Before they had freezers, they found it more difficult to store of 
fresh food for a length of time and so had to make many more trips to their local grocer. 
refrigeration is the process of removing from an enclosed space or from a..." [baby takes 
booklet from her] I guess I'm done with that. Does say [unintelligble].  
 
- 
  
[in the Danger Zone xhibition] 
 

501 
 
Kasi   
dangers in  a kitchen. more than large number of children experience an accident in the 
kitchen. Kitchen Cabinets. I don't know what those symbols-  we can something with 
 
Teagan   
the numbers correspond with 
 
Kasi   
no no, I mean the hazard sign –  it looks like explosion fire bubble 
 
Ashley Fisher   
No, I don't see a key anywhere. 
 
Teagan   
[points out the key at the beginning of the exhibition] 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And it's covered up by the machine 
 
Kasi   
flammable. It was boiling liquid and something else that's covered up. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Also a key above that. [points to a beam in the ceiling] But again, super helpful to have them 
like over there. 
 
- 
 
Kasi   
Yeah, I mean, I have trouble keeping in line. Okay, so if I can't put my finger against it, it's 
hard to that sometimes just skip lines. Sure. So the glass is kind of hard to 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. I noticed that they had physical lines between the things [entries on the sign] – does 
that help, it all 
 
Kasi   
It doesn't always. Okay, because it's like, it's like the line paragraph. If I accidentally 
switched another line, that line is still underneath. So you keep your fingers there so you can 
track it. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How's the lighting here? 
 
Kasi   
is good. 

502 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Where are the stories that they're telling in the cases easy to understand? 
 
Kasi   
No. Okay. It was like, especially that I didn't know what was bashed against what like what's 
the kibosh his head against the thing? Did they grab the monkey? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
Kasi   
And I wish the sign – Like what do these signs mean? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
the key should have been put elsewhere? 
 
Kasi   
Yeah. 
 
Teagan   
And the way  that the things were shown inside the exhibit. It was hard to read the, you 
know, the top part that I was supposed to like? 
 
Kasi   
Yes. Yeah. And especially because they have a little number of things when something like 
the monkey were was on a chair and there was a monkey they had 
 
Ashley Fisher   
the tickets, right next year six. Yeah, so which, yeah. 
 
Teagan   
I know I just rested in the kids area but I'm still tired 
 
Kasi   
Thanks she can take a nap. 
 
Teagan   
She was disappointed with the lack of things to do.

Ashley Fisher   
[alarm in the accessible toilet goes off, staff member handles it quickly and professionally – 
it's just a false alarm] there's a reset button on the left hand side.

8.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
Our post-visit interview took place at a pub down the road from Abbey House. Due to the 
wind in the area as well as over-head planes, the audio is difficult to understand and I was 
unable to transcribe it.  
8.4. Follow-up Interview. 
We met at a café for this interview on 5 June, 2019. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right, so going back over our recordings earlier today, actually I can hear things so that's a 
good start. I'm just repeating a couple things. If you guys have one thing to say to the 
museum, what would it be? Teagan, you had said sounds, make some kind of sounds, make 
some kind of noises and Kasi you had said they need more space to do you guys still agree 
with those. 
 
Kasi   
Yep.  
 
Teagan   
Yep.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. And your favourite things were- Teagan, it was the he/she/them exhibition, and for 
Kasi, it was the Victorian Street. 
 
Kasi   
Yep. Still agreeing with that. Yeah, 
 
Teagan   
yeah, primarily because I had Annora with me. If I hadn't had Annora with me. Then I 
probably would have enjoyed the Victorian street more. But I have been on Victorian streets 
before so it wasn't quite the same. I do always enjoy them. 
 
Kasi   
I just like the fact that they made a street in a building. That made me happy. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right, so you also said that you likely wouldn't return alone, or immediately, but it might be a 
place for you guys to take someone that hadn't been. Still agree with that?  
 
Teagan   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Now why do you think that 
 

504 
 
Teagan   
because of how far away it is. 
 
Kasi   
Oh yeah. And like it was good. But it didn't have enough stuff to feel like I saw everything. So 
like, I wouldn't be oh man I didn't I didn't get to see this or I really want to pay more attention 
then go back over this. Like, yeah I saw it, saw everything. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
For getting there, do you think the museum could help, could help with information? Could 
they help clarify things? Make the whole experience easier?  
 
Teagan   
No, I think it was about as painless as it could be. 
 
Kasi   
So how did you feel the next day. 
 
Teagan   
Tired for the rest of the day.  
 
Kasi   
I fell asleep immediately. Brennen was like What did she do to you guys. 
 
Teagan   
He was so confused. 
 
Kasi   
What time do we get home. 
 
Teagan   
We put Annora to bed about an hour early so would have been about 430 or five.  
 
Kasi   
I went to bed at the same time as Annora. I was really tired.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I got home, at about five o'clock and I'm just laid down and in bed for an hour and a half. It 
was a very long day, very long day. Yeah, but did you have any problems the next day – 
because I know you guys say that you do need to make sure you're taking easy otherwise 
you have repercussions.  
 
Teagan   
I was quite sore the next day. 
 
Kasi   

505 
 
I think I was. Having a hard time remembering  
 
Teagan   
you went to London. The next day,  
 
- 
 
Teagan   
Anyway, to actual question. I would say I probably had an uptick in pain level by about one 
or two. The next day. Yeah, cuz I had to wear my wrist braces at work. 
 
Kasi   
I don't do that. 
 
Teagan   
I had to wear both braces this time because both wrists hurt. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I know I had shin splints basically all of Monday. 
 
Teagan   
That was probably just from walking so quickly to get to the train. We started the day out 
great. With a nice little relaxing break on the train, which was good. 
 
Kasi   
I was like pouring sweat but it was fine. 
 
Teagan   
I feel for the man that was sitting in the other seat with us. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
We were going around the museum and that may reiterate this is definitely a question you 
can say no I don't want to answer. Do you feel like your EDS or your dyslexia affected your 
experience more 
 
Kasi   
dyslexia. Yeah. 
 
Teagan   
You probably noticed by how little time we spent staring at each thing. 
 
Kasi   
We would look at that thing another label. It's why we spent more time, I think, in the street 
than we did in the danger zone, because the danger zone required a lot of reading, and it 
was. And it was hard was very difficult to match the things you look down at the number and 
you look at the thing and then you forget which one you were looking at and you go, oh and 

506 
 
then you just... just gave up because it wasn't worth it. So I guess we're just going to go into 
the next thing. 
 
Teagan   
And put her in a bunch of 10 p things. And then get a bunch of old pennies and then 
contemplate as to whether or not you should. You get to keep them. 
 
Kasi   
How would you compare them use this museum experience at every house with other 
museums you've been to. 
 
Teagan   
I would say it's on par in terms of how much you have to read, it's actually quite similar to 
most museums. Yeah, I would definitely say it's in terms of reading it was quite similar. 
Because it's just a problem that most museums have.  
 
Kasi   
I feel like it was a bit more... I don't want to say disorganised but cluttered. I think, again, I 
think it was a space problem of the fact that danger zone. Yeah, and the space it was a non 
permanent exhibit so there wasn't as much as thought and placement because it wasn't 
permanent. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How would you have museums, fix the reading issue, like with this text. I showed you that 
Claro scan pen app thing. So, do you think double checking all texts against that helpful 
wouldn't have been helpful in the danger zone.  
 
Teagan   
No that was very disorganised, the way that the danger zone could have done that though is 
if it had a little integrated thing. So you can see spotlights so light will shine on the thing. 
Once you once you looked at them. That way you could.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
That doesn't even have to be a very high tech thing it's a simple lighting rig.  
 
Kasi   
I think part of it also is my first question whatever I look at is, what is it, and what is it, what is 
it for. And then what about it, but usually The written text is where did it come from. And it's 
like, I was looking at the room with all the pots and pans I think something very good to have 
is visual contexts like set it up how it will be in that time that's extremely helpful, because 
then I don't have to read. Is this a bathroom is this the kitchen. That helps a lot and just 
being a just having the main points about it. I think it's also good because my biggest 
complaint with the danger zone is my other complaint is the context. I didn't know what the 
context of the objects were in relation to what it could be. 
 
And the facts given... yeah, like the monkey. The monkey didn't make sense that reading the 
text was about the monkey, wasn't about the monkey, it was about someone who bought the 
monkey. And I was like, well, that's not that's not really the story of the monkey you can have 

507 
 
the story is fine but I'd like to know what it is, what it was for, and then the history behind it. I 
feel like that would be helpful. 
 
Teagan   
Yeah, I mean you could do that really simply just by having like printout background of, you 
know, yeah just have a little kids room or a kitchen or something. Something like that. But 
that would have been a space issue because that would have expanded the amount of size 
that they had and  
 
Kasi   
I really like the light solution. And maybe just. 
 
Teagan   
And I find the museum's that have little push button things, helpful. I've only seen that 
something done like that in one or two times, it's always, at technology museums. I've never 
seen them at something that wasn't a Technology Museum. 
 
Kasi   
I think what I think about when I look at how I look at the exhibition, I look at it, try to figure 
out what it is by looking at it find its name, and then try to figure out more about it because 
reading that giant block of text just know I don't get as much as visualising it. I don't 
remember where it was, but I think it was a car museum. They had the objects and their 
name, but next to it, they'd have pictures of people using it. So you could really see them 
using that with archaeological things but like showing how this rq this object is used. So I 
giving it more context so like, just reading someone did something with it isn't always as 
clear, 
 
Teagan   
Something that I think that could have been really cool with the danger zone is granted this 
would cost a bit more money. But like, even if they had like a TV next to it. So you could just 
see how this object was used, like the child swing for example the dangerous one you could 
see, you could click on it and like a little cartoon would pop up with a kid in it and it goes all 
wrong. Oh no, because it's the danger zone, little cartoon thing, kind of like 
 
Kasi   
Like the Fallout, the Fallout game, animation. Like it's friendly but it's.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I mean, remember the, the pictures that at the end they showed, and all these different 
accidents with people and cars, and like children things children used. 
 
Teagan   
Luckily my child was distracted by books and taking them out of a box repeatedly. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think that there's a difference in your experience at paying museums versus non 
paying museums? Obviously this was a paying museum. 
 

508 
 
Kasi   
Gonna have to ask you on that one.  
 
Teagan   
I think you expect slightly more if you pay and the amount that you pay scales. But I wouldn't 
say too terribly much. But I think that's partially because we're from a place where all 
museums charge.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, I was gonna say might be a very cultural thing because British people have a lot more 
feelings about paying for museums, but I can't think of any free museums that I ever went to 
back in the States, and that includes the tiny little County Museum, that had two rooms.  
 
Kasi   
They charge at the Singer museum and I think that's a room.  
 
Teagan   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What if we had gone on a bad day with your EDS? How do you think they would have 
changed things. 
 
Kasi   
I would have sat down a lot more frequently a lot more often. I probably wouldn't have 
looked at as much stuff that wasn't in your chairs. I've had days where I've gone to museums 
and it's just not...  
 
Teagan   
I mean you could tell by, you could tell how tired I was by the end of it. Like, it wasn't 
necessarily my joint pain. Although my joint pain was starting to uptick, but that was just 
because daughter was requiring to be held all the time. By only me. I think her bottom tooth 
is coming through. But yeah, I was starting to get really, really exhausted towards the end, 
just why I not only sat down with Annora, to let her play with the blocks with the books, but 
then also I went into the shoe and we just died for a moment. 
 
Kasi   
And a nap happened. 
 
Teagan   
So, in that sense I thought it was placed perfectly, because I got, I was getting tired. Just as 
there was more things that I could do while sitting down, that we're also kids differently, 
although granted that house in the shoe could have been used by shoe could have been 
used by anyone. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
That is for sure. 
 

509 
 
Kasi   
I know I'm less likely to read if I'm tired because it's very mentally exhausting. So when I'm 
physically exhausted. I'm fine. I'll just look at it, just a cool thing to look at me I think I asked 
you what something was more that I read.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
There were quite a few times, especially in the Victorians, and you're asking me and I'm 
going. I was listening back in this, there's there's literally a lady that said, we could ask her 
questions that we kept saying how approachable she was and yet we never approached her. 
 
Kasi   
She approached me and I asked her a question while she was there, you were there.  
 
Teagan   
I think that's more Kasi's personality. She will literally start asking questions of whoever's 
standing there just whoever is literally right next to her and her curiosity. It's not as strong 
enough to actually go up and ask, ask someone once she's left the particular area.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Like you said, correct me if I'm wrong but that you might have- that you have ADHD.  
 
Kasi   
Yeah, yeah so that's probably part of it.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, probably just from my experience with kids with ADHD they ask a question, and if you 
don't ask and if you don't answer it within half a second, they don't care anymore.  
 
- 
 
Ashley Fisher  
This is a great transition because it's probably my most invasive question of the entire 
process. Do you consider yourself disabled. And again, I want to reiterate, you can tell me. 
No, I don't. I'm not answering this question.  
 
Teagan   
I consider myself as someone who has a disability but not that I'm disabled, mainly because 
it's, in my mind, not severe enough to warrant me needing to buy what are those seats or 
keys for the disabled toilets or constantly needing a mobility aid for me to constantly...  to 
make significant changes in my work or accommodations or stuff like that but it does affect. 
To me, I'm to the point that I would say I have a disability.  
 
Kasi   
I would agree, just specifically because I wouldn't even really say I'm physically disabled in 
my mind that would mean, I mean I get tired and I can't do certain things for long. But like I 
don't need a disabled toilet. I don't need a wheelchair. And because I don't directly need 
those things. I feel like that belongs to someone else. I don't know. And the only thing I say 

510 
 
that actively impacts me a lot, would be dyslexia, but usually I can get by fine with someone 
knowing that, Like, I don't need special help, don't really need special accommodations. 
 
Teagan   
We definitely needed it in uni, in academia.  
 
Kasi   
And when it comes to work it's usually just my boss understanding that I'm a bit slower. 
When it comes to reading things, and that there will usually be some kind of spelling errors, 
but other than that it's not, it's not too bad. 
 
Teagan   
So, I was actually having this exact same conversation with Brennen not too long ago. Yeah. 
My suspicion is partially, the conditioning that we've received, of what a stereotype of 
someone with a disability is. And I think, Kasi and I both accept the fact that at some point in 
our lives will be disabled. And when we're older, there is a strong possibility that we will need 
a wheelchair to get around and that kind of stuff. 
 
Kasi   
Which would happen hopefully not for a significant amount of time, not until our 80s.  
 
Teagan   
But we are able to have a mother as a good example now my mother is did not take care of 
her body at all. She. She was a, she was a ballerina dancer for quite a long time. In a 
Polynesian dancer. So she was always quite fit. But my father has had to basically paid to fix 
her body so many times, and I can't think of one vacation or anything that we ever took on 
that mom wasn't in pain for. And it was always kind of an undercurrent of her having to take 
some kind of painkiller or, or her making a paint noise. Oh, no. No, I'm fine let's carry on. I'm 
just gonna sit for a bit you guys come back and find me. Don't worry about me go have fun, 
that type of stuff.  
 
Kasi   
Yeah, I mean, I think part of it was me so I definitely. I've accepted this is probably the best 
I'm ever going to feel or be in my mind, so I could probably, I could probably more physically 
fit but I don't think that kind of pains ever was going away I don't think my dyslexia ever is is 
ever going to go away. And I don't think not know but in the future. it's definitely going to be a 
regression of who I am and that makes me sad. But I wouldn't say I'm at a point where I'm 
unlucky. If that makes sense. I don't know. I also think that probably, in my mind, it's been 
stigmatised that I wouldn't call myself disabled, because I'm not severely mentally, physically 
disabled so it's like, I can get on roller coasters, I can graduate from college. So I just... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think it's somehow linked to independence? 
 
Kasi   
Well I think disabled people can be independent. I think someone in a wheelchair could, 
depending on how severe, could be independent. But it partially has to do with that and it 
more has to do with in my mind how much freedom. Like are you relying on someone else. 
Can you walk upstairs. Can you go into those kinds of things. Do you need to use one of 

511 
 
those Lift things or can you walk up the stairs. Like someone can be independent and we 
can use that Lift thing but can't go down the stairs. 
 
Teagan   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Very interesting.  
 
Teagan   
I think it also has to do with the fact that it's kind of hard to judge, because everything 
becomes your new normal. As soon as you get used to it for long enough. So, someone may 
think, if they weren't chronic pain that that would then make them disabled. Kasi and I have 
chronic pain. And yet, even when we have like after I had Annora, I had an uptick in the 
amount of pain, chronic pain I had like on a scale of one to 10 they went up one as my new 
normal as my new constant, but I wouldn't say that it made me more disabled. Even though I 
will be able to say yes there was an obvious uptick. 
 
Kasi   
I think it's really interesting especially with hidden disabilities. I'm trying to think of this like 
with my friend, say if I was something like that, they sort of think I'm like, whatever with me 
Are you in pain right now. Yeah. And they're like, Oh, I didn't realise. I've never not in pain. I 
complain when it gets to the point where it's hard to deal with. It's like I wake up in pain, I go 
to sleep in pain right good little middle of the night with pain I sit down and pay night and 
pain. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I am pain. 
 
Kasi   
I think like taking said it's the norm this pain is there. And it doesn't make me want to do 
things. But it doesn't make me not able to do things until it gets until it gets worse. And I don't 
know, I guess it's kind of this feeling of Can I push through. Could I keep going. Like with 
reading. It's really hard, but I can push through it, it's going to take me longer I'm gonna 
mess it up, someone's going to get very angry with me. But I can do it eventually I not 
everyone can and I think, to me, that's that barrier. That's the difference in disability versus 
disabled. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. 
 
Teagan   
Like sometimes my husband, an able bodied man, he occasionally has pains in his legs that 
refuses to go to the doctor about. That's a different issue. But it doesn't quite understand 
though, when, why, want to do travelling, and that kind of stuff now I sees like Teagan we 
may not be able to. Should we save more money for the future, and that kind of stuff and like 
yeah that's fine and all, but why would I want to put off something that I may not be able to 
do in the future. 
 

512 
 
Kasi   
I think with mom is a good example of that. 
 
Teagan   
Having our mother was a very good. It's a realistic expectation of what we may end up 
doing, which is one of the reasons why I've been so proactive in terms of physiotherapy and 
trying to prevent the uptake that I'm having with Annora, so that way I can try and manage it 
all.  
 
Kasi   
Yeah, cuz like when I think of what happens to my mom and what could happen to me. I was 
very physically active as a kid but college kind of kicked that our mom kind of just hit a wall 
like a brick wall, and then it just that was it. That's pretty much it dead stop, and then fall.  
 
Teagan   
She's quite in denial about it too for quite a while. Take it.  
 
Kasi   
How many times have had to yell at her to not pick things up like the day after her surgery. 
When she got those shots, she got like shots. You're not supposed to do anything when you 
get those shots because otherwise it will immediately reverse it, and she was like, I feel 
better I could do it. No, you feel better because you're not hurting yourself. Like, I know feel 
okay, doing certain things, but if I'm an idiot and I do things more exaggerated things than 
like I can feel okay, I could do things I never would do normally but what I could go run a 
mile and then fall back, and then die and dislocated dislocate my knee as I stepped out 
wrong. I know I still have a problem, even though don't feel it as bad as other times, if I don't 
keep that in mind, other times are going to be all the time. I know if I sit crisscross 
applesauce relax my legs. Relax My knees and lean forward I will dislocate my kneecap so I 
don't do that anymore. And it hasn't happened in years. Doesn't mean I'm going to do it. It's 
kind of like being allergic to food. My mom's started eat more food that she's allergic to 'I 
didn't have reactions!!!!' 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I think it makes a very interesting point about the difference between your mom and you 
guys though, because you've grown up, mostly grown up with these diagnoses and she 
hasn't.  
 
Teagan   
I mean if I didn't have Teagan. I think I'd much more like her and I think I would have ruined 
my body way more than I have much more like your mother You mean yeah because one 
thing that I made sure to do. Whenever I went to physiotherapy whenever I learned about 
something I then told Kasi about it, so she had kind of a five years advantage, a lot of the 
stuff.  
 
Kasi   
Did I take it? Questionable. 
 
Teagan   

513 
 
But she did have that knowledge seeping into her and work, it's a lot of constantly telling her 
to avoid doing this because this can exaggerate it and that kind of stuff. Granted, I was 
wasn't able to help her with reading anything like that. 
 
Kasi   
It's funny because you were blamed for some of it. Some of my. Some of my teachers 
thought she taught me how to be dyslexic  
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's not how dyslexia works....  
 
Kasi   
I thought it was so funny that you that that you, you got certain letters right and I got them 
wrong and take its pattern. Oh well. What can I say... I don't know if I ever told you that I 
remember that very vividly.  
 
Teagan   
I'm sure you have.  
 
Kasi   
I think it was the, the letters and numbers ones. Yeah. I don't tend to mix up letters and 
numbers. No. Yeah, I do. I make mix up nines and fours though.  
 
Teagan   
That's why when I make my nines of my fours, they're very distinct when I write them. The 
way I wrote my letters is distinct so that I know  
 
Kasi   
I absolutely thought about that with my handwriting too.  
 
Teagan   
Yeah, cuz my sister and I have almost identical handwriting actually looking at sheets yeah I 
could see that that sure they were more identical early on yeah they're quite similar. 
 
Kasi   
She's better at cursive. We write our Es almost exactly the same in my opinion. 
 
Teagan   
But just in general we tend to write Es the same way. 
 
Kasi   
But, especially with. 
 
Teagan   
That's why when I wrote my thank you cards, my wedding, I conscripted my sister to help me 
write them. 
 

514 
 
Kasi   
Yep, yep. 
 
Teagan   
No one knew the difference. Nope. 
 
Kasi   
Well, that's the end of my questions for this you guys have any questions or anything. 
Anything you want to talk about now.  
 
Teagan   
I hope this was useful.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
It was shockingly useful actually. Yeah. Like, I feel I could write an entire thesis just on you 
two  so. So this is very very helpful. There were a couple things that I wanted to double 
check. Kasi I need your email address because the one.

While we were there… 
o 
Sarah called reservations to handle an upgrade ticket – she had the agency to say 
“hey I don’t know how to do this” and Paul allowed her to contact Res to learn how 
to do it 
o 
James had to turn away some walk-ins because of limited numbers; he explained the 
situation, that it was due to COVID restrictions, and they were very understanding 
and okay with it 
8.6. Follow-up Interview. 
I asked Teagan for her experience with sunflower lanyards. The notes from our conversation 
are as follows. 
• 
Not a lot of change over all 
• 
Sometimes gets looks, but is pretty sure that’s more from people looking to see 
what’s on her lanyard 
• 
Scheme is helpful when you need to ask for help with a hidden disability 
• 
Really questions when people say they get a lot of dirty looks for wearing the lanyard 
– influence of neurodiversity on the ability to read facial expressions?

Lisa is a woman with general anxiety disorder.  
9.1. Pre-visit Interview. 
I met Lisa at the Abbey House Museum and we sat in the attached café for this interview. 
We met on 20 November, 2019 in the morning.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Excellent. So my name is Ashley, as you might have remembered, we've emailed a few 
times. And before we get started, I just wanted to go over a few things to make sure we're all 
on the same page. My research is looking at accessibility for people with hidden disabilities 
at museums and heritage sites and your participant because you have a disability. So, as 
mentioned, we'll have three different meetings one now, one, technically immediately after 
this. So to go around the site, and then later on, we'll probably schedule a Skype or a phone 
call or something like that. To have a follow up and talk about Basically, anything that's 
changed since then. So yes, I sent you, I think, a copy of the information sheet in the 
consent form, but I have copies here for you. So here's the Information sheets. And here's 
the consent form. We go much further. Get that out of the way. Fantastic and I might take 
some photos while we're here, but it's never going to be your face. I don't know if it's going to 
be like hands, things like that. Okay. Great. So I've got a few questions for you. Before we 
get started. You mentioned that you have anxiety I believe. Yes, yes. Okay. So obviously 
I've done a little research on it, but I want to hear your take on it, how you define it and how it 
impacts your daily life. 
 
Lisa   
So that's quite a good question. So I take medication. Anyway, it helps with that. So I take 
(setelopram?) and I've been on that now for about three years. And the way that impacts me 
mostly is sort of social anxiety. So it will be I can't just go out somewhere I have to kind of 

516 
 
think about how I look and think about how I'm going to get somewhere. Whether that's 
parking or buses, it's kind of planning to the extreme. Okay. So you know, other people 
might kind of look at the traffic route, but I would look at where can I stop? I would give lots 
of extra time to get somewhere. Either that or sometimes I'm mega late because I've had a 
panic attack so I'm either mega early or mega late. It means that I cancel my plans a lot. I 
don't always give the real reasons for cancelling. Okay, so you know I might tell my friends 
I'm really sorry and I know it was gonna come out for this has come up yeah. Or sometimes 
like it causes migraines, you know I have to cancel just because I'm just generally not feeling 
well. That's that's that's the main thing, really, social anxiety. I don't really go out that much. 
Yeah. Especially in the evening. And also because it's personally-  so I had anxiety before 
my son was born but then after my son was born, so I have extra anxiety about different 
things. And so like, I don't like leaving him in the evening, we like routine. He's really good 
with routine. And I don't like to change that. So, you know, bedtime routine is very important 
in our house. So I won't just kind of leave him with a babysitter, Yeah, unless it's urgent. 
Yeah, so that's kind of how it works. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, I take medication for anxiety as well. So a lot of what you were talking about with 
planning and sometimes cancelling and not always given the exact reason I do that. Yeah, 
just” Oh, I'm sorry. My daughter's not feeling very well, I think I better stay in.” Yeah, it's, I 
understand completely. So talking about How you get ready for a trip to a museum or just 
anywhere in general? How do you prepare for it? 
 
Lisa   
So there will be a lot googling, okay? That would be where is it, Google where it is, so say 
I'm taking the car it'll be how long does it take to get there? How long would it normally take 
someone to get there then there's my added time. How long does it take me to get there? 
Yeah  
 
Ashley Fisher   
25% extra, Yeah, 
 
Lisa   
Yeah. Then it’s where to park. So I use parkopedia quite a lot because it'll tell you the tariffs 
whether you pay by card or cash. I think about clothes. I don't like being too hot. So I have to 
think about what I'm gonna wear. Have I got enough change in my purse? like do I need to 
stop off at the petrol station? It will be. So sometimes I like to look for photographs of where 
I'm going, like the inside. So for example, if I didn't know this café, I'd be looking on Street 
View. Where's the door? How do I get in there? What's the menu like? So I haven't got an 
obsession with food. But if I'm going out for a meal, I would check what the menu is first 
before I get there. But we Yeah, like I say so looking inside what was the reception desks? 
So like I said, it's not planning to, to the extreme. Yeah. don't really need to do all that but 
that's what goes through my brain.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I love looking on TripAdvisor just to see photos of menus. Yeah, I  would like but I just like to 
know. Yeah, yep. There were lots of little restaurants that we would go to quite a lot back in 
Chicago and I had a specific order every single time because I knew I could say it without 
stuttering. I knew exactly what the routine was. I couldn't deviate from it. Yeah, 
 
Lisa   

517 
 
yeah. I went to a Thai restaurant with  some friends for their birthday. And I had to look 
online and I was like, I can't pronounce anything. I don't know what these things are. So I 
just went with the Tikka Masala because I know I know what that is. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, so lots of Google parkopedia? Yeah. Any other particular websites that 
you check? 
 
Lisa   
Probably Facebook. Okay. I'm on there quite a lot anyway. So I just find it handy sometimes 
to look at their pages. But nothing specific. It's normally just Google and I'll just see what 
comes up. Yeah. depends where I'm going 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you check out the museum's official website? 
 
Lisa   
Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And again, it might just be to see how many floors, where I should be 
heading, where they might recommend to park, because sometimes they have travel info on 
there so on. And sometimes just a general nose of things. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you ever check out accessibility pages? 
 
Lisa   
Not usually. It's normally on the same page. I wouldn't search it out. Sure. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, are there any specialist equipment or aids or things like that that you bring with you? 
 
Lisa   
No, just make sure that I've got my phone and it's fully charged and you know, day two and 
stuff. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What eventualities do you plan for? 
 
Lisa   
Oh crumbs. so there would be traffic jams. If it's public transport it would be so I need to get 
that bus. but if that bus cancels and I'm going to be late so I'll get there earlier but I tend to 
find.. sort of loo trips and something to eat. Sometimes I can feel a bit wobbly so like is there 
somewhere I can go back and just get a quick bite to eat and have a sit down. So, you know 
cafés and I'd like to know whether you know where the loos are. So I've been to places that 
don't have toilets and I hate that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, how much time would you say it takes you to get everything together? 
 

518 
 
Lisa   
Weeks. So I would normally as soon as I know I'm going somewhere, that's when I would 
start googling. Sure. And I would Google over and over again, even if it's the same 
information. Especially if I'm using Google Maps, I'll Google it and I'll be like, Okay, so how 
much time is it saying that it takes me at this time of day on and then it might be you know, 
the next week? I do on a different day, you know, how long is it going to be on this set? 
Because it changes Yeah. So for example, I went to Birmingham four weeks ago by myself 
which is quite a good thing. Yeah. And it said three hours and then the next morning and it 
said two hours. I still start off at the exact same time, just in case Yeah. I ended up having to 
just wait in the service station for ages to be late. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So yeah, it could take 
it. It's not that it takes me weeks of planning, it's just that that's when I start. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
It's more that you do like a little bit each day. 
 
Lisa   
And it goes through my mind and I just think how many to look at that. Yeah. I mean, the 
Birmingham thing was quite funny because when it's for work, I can do it. And it doesn't 
bother me. But if I was going to Birmingham, from my trip for myself, I probably wouldn't 
even go to be honest, it's too much investment Yeah. Yeah. I've got a different hat on. 
9.2. Site Visit. 
Lisa and I then went around Abbey House Museum. This too was on 20 November, 2019. 
Sensing her rising anxiety, I did not audio record this part of our visit, instead taking more 
detailed notes. 
9.3. Post-Visit Interview. 
After the museum visit, Lisa and I walked down the road to a nearby pub. Again, this 
interview took place on 20 November, 2019.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so let me pull up my questions. Yep. All right. Okay. Wonderful. So we've gone to 
Abbey House Museum. Now how would you normally get there?  
 
Lisa   
By car. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And you know how to get there pretty? 
 
Lisa   
Yes.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Pretty well by now. And when you're driving there, is it easy to find? Are there lots of signs 
along the road or...? 
 
Lisa   

519 
 
No, I don't think there are, okay, and I know that people usually find.... have trouble finding 
the car park okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So let's talk about finding a museum. Do you think it's easy to find the museum from the 
street itself? 
 
Lisa   
No, I don't think people know that it's there, actually, as a museum. They know there's a 
building now. Yeah, but... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
they don't realise that that's it.  
 
Lisa   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think the entrance is easy to find when you get up to the building? 
 
Lisa   
Depends which direction you come from, but I think it's okay. Although it's not clear, the sign 
kind of says that you can come in and there's a shop, but it's not really clear that that's the 
museum entrance.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Right. Do you find the layout of the museum easy to understand?  
 
Lisa   
No, no. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I like that you are being completely honest. You are not pulling any punches. So talking 
about the shop, do you find the signage easy to understand? 
 
Lisa   
No. I think it's quite difficult to know where you go from there.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. 
 
Lisa   
The pricing is clear. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think there's enough space to move around the shop? 

520 
 
 
Lisa   
Well, ideally, it would be bigger. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, we're talking about an ideal world.  
 
Lisa   
It's okay if it was just me in the shop or just a couple people in the shop. If there had been a 
couple more people in the shop, I wouldn't have stopped. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So I'd imagine if there's a school group there, oh, you're just hightailing it there.  
 
Lisa   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think it's easy to navigate the shop? 
 
Lisa   
Yeah. But there is a back bit that you might not know is there, where they have the books. 
You don't know it's there. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
No, no, I missed that. 
 
Lisa   
So right where the desk.. the desk's there, then there's a little door here and you can go in 
there and there's a load of books, but it's not clear that you are allowed to go. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Is it? I think I've been in that room before because it's like a big giant table. 
 
Lisa   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I have been there before. But I completely forgot that it existed. Yeah. So turning to the 
toilets, were they easy to find?  
 
Lisa   
Yes, they are.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Quite well signposted.  

521 
 
 
Lisa   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were they clean?  
 
Lisa   
Yes.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was the floor especially clean? 
 
Lisa   
Yes, I think so. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
talking about the staff now. Did staff members treat you any differently than another visitor?  
 
Lisa   
No 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was the team member able to offer help when you asked?  
 
Lisa   
Yes, yes. Very detailed help. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. It was a good good spiel. Yeah. Did you feel welcome there?  
 
Lisa   
Yeah. Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think you would have felt welcome there if you weren't married to someone who 
worked there? 
 
Lisa   
Yeah, I do find this one of the friendlier museums I think probably because it's smaller. Yeah. 
And they, you are in touch with a lot of staff as you go through. Whereas other museums, 
you may only see one or two members of staff yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
seemed like there was a lot more staff there today than the last time I was here. 
 

522 
 
Lisa   
That might be because they knew that they had the group in.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Thinking about all of the exhibitions overall, were the displays clear. And you can interpret it 
however you want. 
 
Lisa   
I think the Victorian street has lots of little things that are not necessarily clearly signposted 
and you wouldn't know what they are. Okay. Unless you, you know, picked up some of the 
loose information. Yeah. I think they've done that on purpose. And I think the new ones 
upstairs are fairly well, like He/She/They and the danger zone. The signing, just quite 
engaging. As I mentioned, I don't look at the signs. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there any videos that we watched? I don't think so. 
 
Lisa   
No there I did see some, but I didn't watch them. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were the stories and tales of the experiences easy to understand?  
 
Lisa   
Yeah, I think so. I would say so. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How was the overall noise level? 
 
Lisa   
I'm generally quite good but as soon as the group's there, I'm not going in their direction. 
Even upstairs in the kids bit, so I love kids, but I wasn't going to be hanging around. And the 
end bit where the little girl was crawling. Yeah. I wasn't going to be trying to concentrate and 
look at the stuff, I'd just move through. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah, it's gonna say you seem to move through that quite quick.  
 
Lisa   
Yeah, yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
It's very polite. And you know, no one would notice. Do you think some places were too 
loud? 
 
Lisa   
For me? Yes. I think having that group there, it was quite loud. 

523 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Any places that were too quiet? 
 
Lisa   
No. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Now let's talk about lighting. How was the overall lighting? 
 
Lisa   
Good for me? Yeah. Cuz I mentioned I quite like... I quite like when it's not really bright 
artificial light. Tends to make me feel a bit wobbly. I mean it is quite dark in the Victorian 
street area, but I quite like that.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Were there any places that were too bright? 
 
Lisa   
The stairway going up was just quite bright. Yeah. But obviously I understand that it needs to 
be bright, right? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. And do you think there any places that were too dark 
 
Lisa   
Not too dark for me. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Was there enough places to sit or rest? 
 
Lisa   
No.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so now we're going to think specifically about the Victorian streets. Yeah. You already 
mentioned that you think some of the displays weren't necessarily clear enough?  
 
Lisa   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Were there any particular sections that popped out to you as you needed something a little 
bit more? 
 
Lisa   

524 
 
The first one where this all sort of- was it the pharmacy? Where it had all the little different 
pills and things. I'd like to know more about those and maybe there was information there 
that I just didn't see.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah. Well, if there is and you didn't see it, that's also a problem. Right, with the stories and 
tales of the exhibition- of the exhibit, easy to understand. 
 
Lisa   
Yeah, I think it was clear it was a Victorian street. And you're sort of moving through to the 
backstreet. Yes. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
You also took a different trail than they normally suggest is that intentional was that to avoid 
things? 
 
Lisa   
It was to avoid that group.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you think that detracted from the experience or the story?  
 
Lisa   
Um, yeah, because it meant that I couldn't see. I couldn't go to the school but there was that 
whole section. And where there's I think it was a toy shop back there – I think it was a toy 
shop – anyway, and I know there's a couple of shops behind that little school but certainly I 
didn't see any of that.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sure, yeah. And overall noise level in the Victorian street? 
 
Lisa   
Fairly loud. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Quite echoey too. 
 
Lisa   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
And the light level in the Victorian streets. 
 
Lisa   
I mean, it's dim. But I like that. Yeah. 
 

525 
 
Ashley Fisher   
But as someone who- but as a looker not a reader, yeah, it doesn't really make that much 
[difference]. Yeah.  
 
Lisa   
So if I wanted to read everything, obviously, it'd be a bit dark, so I'd get that for anyone with 
any visual impairment that would be quite dark. Yeah. That's why I say it for me. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, exactly. Yeah,  
 
Lisa   
For me It's okay.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
And enough places to sit and/or rest? 
 
Lisa   
I think there just needs to be a little bit more to sit down 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Or at least a little bit. More. obvious. 
 
Lisa   
Yeah. Yeah. Especially if I was, you know, maybe just wanting to sit down and kind of soak 
in a little bit. Or if I wanted my son to go out and explore.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, around a little bit. 
 
Lisa   
Yeah, yeah. There's nowhere for me to sit that I could really see. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so now let's talk about just what was your favourite thing about the museum? 
 
Lisa   
Just the Victorian street with all the different little bits and bobs? Yes. Because I like that kind 
of stuff anyway. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What do you like about it? 
 
Lisa   
It intrigues me with all the little bits and bobs that people used to buy or that belonged to 
people. I quite like those kinds of things myself, little momentos. I just would have liked to 

526 
 
know where it was from, who it was from, so the history's there. Treasure boxes and things 
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What's your least favourite thing about that museum? 
 
Lisa   
I think I'd have to say the child died bit. it's important, but I... Yeah, I don't think it's 
appropriate, the location. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I had two miscarriages between my two kids. So like, seeing that is not an area I'd 
particularly like to see. Like, yeah. And also the height of where they put the picture kind of 
bothers me. Yes. Quite child height. Yeah. Yeah, it is important and I think that it should be 
somehow there but maybe we need to think about the presentation a little bit.  
 
Lisa   
And also it's the very first thing you see when you walk in the children's section Yeah, so I 
don't quite understand why, why would it be there. Yeah, I think generally we need a better 
relationship with death and we need to talk about death more. Yeah, but yeah, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So what's one good thing related to disability and accessibility in relation to the museum? 
 
Lisa   
For my disability or disability in general?  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Anything. Yeah. 
 
Lisa   
I mean, I would say, I didn't use it, but I know there's a lift. I know there is disabled toilet. I 
know that is the ramp going in on the entrance. So I think some of the physical stuff to say is 
that it's a very old museum that's very limited. I think they do quite well for physical access. 
All right, 
 
Ashley Fisher   
and what is one bad thing related to accessibility or disability? 
 
Lisa   
Layout. For someone who has anxiety, it's just not very clear with where- I know they explain 
to go through the door and bump left but it's like a little maze to even just get to the Victorian 
street from there.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
I think that's particularly significant because you are so well acquainted that it still feels like a 
maze.  Yeah, yeah. Did any barriers or easy fixes jump out at you that way over there- While 
we were there? 

527 
 
 
Lisa   
I didn't actually see a sign to say where the stairs were to go upstairs. In the Victorian Street. 
Yeah, that might be there, but I didn't see it. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Well, if you don't see it.  
 
Lisa   
That's still the same.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, we didn't use any particular accessibility tools there. But do you think that there were 
any that they could have supplied to you? Even if it's something as simple as, you know, 
signs or maps or layouts or something like that. 
 
Lisa   
Maybe they could just hand out a map to people just to kind of say what the usual route 
would be, how to get there, as in how to get to the Victorian Street. Yeah. Where the steps 
are, where it brings you out. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Feels like that's a museum that's really easy to get turned around him.  
 
Lisa   
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
What do you think the museum should design into their exhibitions from the very beginning? 
Since the community room and the temporary exhibition space tend to change fairly 
regularly, yeah.  
 
Lisa   
For me, it would be having more handout sheets to just pick up and read. Because I tend to 
scan if I- if it's just on the wall or something I tend to just scan it. Yeah, whereas just a bit 
more time I just hold it in my hand where I'm not sharing it with someone else. Yeah, I would 
spend a little bit longer not kind of feel pushed to keep going. And also it's not very clear that 
there are exhibitions upstairs and they do change. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
I didn't realise that the last room was the community gallery that changed, so even though 
there are signs that say the dates it's gonna be there.  
 
Lisa   
yes and it's moved, so that that used to be in a different section, it's been moved to that area 
okay so that there's a bigger space. yeah if you don't need just... like I say, I know the 
museum so if you hadn't already been there before I mean... 
 

528 
 
Ashley Fisher   
How did the staff make you feel? 
 
Lisa   
Welcome. Fine. Yeah. I mean, I get self conscious just because I know them and they're 
probably thinking what is she doing? Yeah. But yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Do you feel like you were treated differently than any other visitor? 
 
Lisa   
Only in that... because they know me? Yeah. But before I knew them, I always felt it was a 
friendlier place.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
okay. 
 
Lisa   
So, my husband used to work at a different museum. And I very rarely went into that one. I 
still don't know that many of the staff members he worked with whereas this one, I know a lot 
more. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
yeah, yeah. In my experience, each museum has a very different feel.  
 
Lisa   
different dynamics.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. At my museum,  We all are based around this one small desk, that's 
probably about the size just of the exterior of this. So four of us on any one shift, we have to 
get along, And you can tell that we all get along because we have to spend so much time 
together. Whereas, another Museum, there's two staff members, one in the first entrance 
area and one that travels around through the other ones. And like, they may say hello to 
each other. Yeah, you can just tell Yeah, yeah. Do you think you would have been treated 
differently if your disability was visible? 
 
Lisa   
Yeah, yeah. So I think if you come in... if you have a physical disability, I think people are 
much more comfortable with offering you help. Yeah. Or asking if you need any help, they 
would, you know, "just let me get that door for you" there would be something then that they 
would, you know, I think they would be much more open to asking you if you need help. 
Yeah. Which can be bad as well because it can presume that just because you're in a 
wheelchair you need help. Yeah. And you're not independent. So I suppose it goes both 
ways. But they wouldn't look at me, especially because they know me. They wouldn't look at 
me and say Do you need any help today? Sure. Yeah. And if they did, I'd probably say no. 
Even if I was really anxious. Yeah.  
 

529 
 
Ashley Fisher   
In going around other museums, have you ever felt overly anxious or on the verge of a panic 
attack?  
 
Lisa   
Yeah, yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Have staff ever reached out or do you just get the British? Let's ignore it, it'll go away. 
 
Lisa   
No. So I think I just dealt with it myself and they probably wouldn't know that it was a panic 
attack. I've had them just outside the city museum and my husband was working at the time. 
So I rang him and said, I've just had a panic attack. I was at the German market. And the 
staff were good, like the, they let you have a room to sit down and my chair got a drink and 
stuff. But again, you know, they knew me. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
So, yeah, yeah. Which kind of, yeah, 
 
Lisa   
So if I had gone to a museum in York, by myself, and I was feeling a bit anxious, yes. And I 
felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack, I would just leave the museum. Okay. I don't 
think it would ask for help Yeah. It's happened to restaurants before where I just said, Oh, I 
gotta get out, yeah. actually asked the staff for help. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Would you accept him?  
 
Lisa   
Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Sometimes asking for help is really difficult. Yeah, 
 
Lisa   
I think it depends on if I did feel like, Okay, if I just get outside, then I'll feel Okay, then I 
wouldn't accept help, you know? Yeah, but sometimes it is a case of, you know, can you just 
help me sit down? Get me a drink? Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
This might be a bit of a throwaway question, but would you visit Abbey House Museum 
again? 
 
Lisa   
Oh I so would! 
 

530 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, so if you could tell the museum one thing regarding the accessibility of their site what 
would it be? 
 
Lisa   
Um just not presume that because I haven't got you know, a leg missing that I'm okay. That I 
know my way around. And just probably think about the signage a little more. Because 
obviously they are comfortable and they know the layout and it is probably easy for them to 
not realise how difficult it can be to get from the shop to the Victorian Street.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
That's perfectly fine. I forgot to ask this but how long do you normally spend in a museum? 
 
Lisa   
Probably about an hour, maybe two hours. It depends on how big it is, What which parts 
interesting 
 
Ashley Fisher   
perhaps to do with how busy it is on a day? Oh yeah. 
 
Lisa   
So I wouldn't go to have lunch. It'd be like, right we'll go from you know, like this morning, 
half 10 till half 11-ish and that'd be me done. yeah 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Wonderful. I do have one curious question. If they were to do things like autism hours or 
quiet hours where they limit the number of people that are in there, would you be more likely 
to go? 
 
Lisa   
No, I wouldn't. I'd encourage them to do it for other people, right. But... 
 
Ashley Fisher   
you wouldn't feel that that was necessarily something that 
 
Lisa   
Yeah, I wouldn't feel it was for me, okay. And feel. I feel like if there's something that is for 
autism then those people with their carers or their families. should be able to enjoy that and 
not feel like they have to share that space and be apologetic for outbursts like that so that's 
just me being in that they deserve that. That's that time and space. Yeah. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Interesting.  
9.4. Follow-up Interview. 
Due to distance, Lisa and I did not meet in person for this interview. Instead, we spoke over 
the phone whilst I recorded it on my end. This phone call occurred on 27 November, 2019. 

531 
 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right, so I just wanted to start out our chat with just sort of a recap of things we talked 
about last time. So one thing that you wanted to tell the museum was that they shouldn't 
assume everybody's fine just because they don't have any visible disability. Is that still 
accurate?  
 
Lisa 
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher 
Okay. And also to consider their signage because they probably need some fresh eyes.  
 
Lisa 
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher 
Okay. And you would definitely return and your favorite aspect was probably the Victorian 
streets.  
 
Lisa   
Yeah, yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right, excellent. How did you feel the next day? 
 
Lisa   
Um, it was a bit weird, because I felt really tired. I actually had a panic attack that night, 
which I haven't in a while. Yeah. So, yeah, I was quite tired the next day. I'm feeling a little bit 
anxious. But I spoke quite a lot with my husband, obviously. Yeah, we talked about things 
that the museum has been doing and the feedback that they've been getting anyway. And 
it's, it felt good to actually say, you know, not criticize, but just to say, actually, this is how I 
feel when I go to these places? Yes, kind of acknowledge that that happens and yeah, yeah, 
that's very good. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay, oh, I might have to follow up and see what that feedback is. Alright, um, how 
significantly did your disability affect the visit, do you think? 
 
Lisa   
It affects in the sense that we missed out because wherever it was busy, the pub and stuff I 
didn't go in and I know that it could have been somewhere that I don't know, then it probably 
would have been worse because that would have been having to plan, you know, the train 
journey, right? 
 
Ashley Fisher   
When you were avoiding those crowded areas, was it more because of the noise because of 
the space? Because it was, you know, sort of cramped? What do you think? 

532 
 
 
Lisa   
Yeah, I think it's more space with me. Okay. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Some of those places can get very small in that museum. Did this museum remind you of 
any other museums that you visited in good ways or in bad ways? 
 
Lisa   
Um this one street scene and that always sticks out in my mind because it's similar to the 
school. Yeah, and I like that. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, that's York Castle Museum. 
 
Lisa   
Yeah.  
 
Ashley Fisher   
Any others it brings to mind? 
 
Lisa  
Oh, maybe JORVIK? Yeah. And that's because I think that's the kind of museum I like, 
where you are so surrounded by the museum type thing. Yeah, it’s not just an object or 
reading it, I like the whole kind of scene. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yeah, yeah, there's a museum from where I'm from called Cantigny Park, and it tells the 
history of an army platoon or something that's from that area? And one of the things that it 
does really really well is it takes you through the wars that they were involved in. And it's set 
up like the Victorian street at Abbey House, like you walk through a recreation of a Paris 
Street and some trenches from World War One and like, you go on to the beach when they 
were on Normandy, it's really really cool. I mean, it's this tiny little museum, but it's honestly 
one of the most effective things that I've ever visited. Just because you feel like you're there. 
 
Lisa   
Yeah, that's the thing I like. I guess JORVIK is the same that sticks out in my mind again, 
just when you get in. I don't know if it's still like that. But when you get in the car and you go 
around, and it stinks. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Yes. We've even updated it so there's multiple smells now. So it's not just poo the entire 
time. There's a nice part where it smells like burning wood so it's almost manageable All 
right, and do you think there are different expectations put on paying versus non paid 
museums from a customer's point of view? 
 
Lisa   

533 
 
Um yeah, I think you expect to get a little bit more and more money so if I was comparing 
Leeds City Museum, that's free, to Abbey House, you probably get a lot more experience if 
the museum’s not free. Yeah. That can kind of detract from it a little bit. Because you notice 
the expense as you go into the museum, you're expecting maybe a bit more experience. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
Okay. Um, if we had taken this trip on a bad day for your anxiety, do you think it would have 
changed the experience? Or even going? 
 
Lisa   
I think just because I know the museum I would still have, I would still have gone but I 
probably would have been there even less time. I think I maybe would have broken it up with 
going for a drink and then go back in, something like that. Okay. Yeah. 
 
Ashley Fisher   
All right. And this is, this is my last question, but it's a quite a personal one. Do you consider 
yourself disabled. Okay. Do you consider yourself a person with a disability? 
 
Lisa   
No, no. Okay.

Going back and forth between the different types of panels – using the laminated 
booklet too

Interested in the history of the building itself 
• 
Went up the great hall staircase first

Finally asked a question – asked why there isn't a statue of Thomas Cromwell in 
York 
• 
Poor room guide has literally no idea – they know a lot more about Frank Green 

536 
 
• 
And now he's just chatting – but the room guide is trying to be nice and 
accommodating 
• 
Oh bless his heart 
• 
Passed him off to a friend who knows much more about medieval stuff 
• 
And they are juuuuust talking away 
• 
Alas he still has no answer 
• 
Looking at lot at the objects 
• 
Doesn't like the modern wing 
• 
But this does point out the lack of flow in the building – we've skipped the first half of 
the building

"Sounds like Frank Green had OCD"

Not a Frank Green fan then 
• 
But my pens spilled again and I've got red ink all over my hands 
• 
He does totally love velvet 
• 
He's looking at the children's dress up 
• 
Bit unsteady on his legs – might just be his lankiness 
• 
Seems intrigued by the writing on the walls 
• 
Also the demolition and restoration panels 
• 
Seems to like the thread of Frank greens life in general, just as a way to feel 
connected to the house? 
• 
Yep bit unsteady on his legs rn 
• 
Retracing our steps now

Looking at the art

• 
Who looked vaguely horrified that he walked into there 
• 
Examining the ship 
• 
From all sides 
• 
Very quiet in here, not super chatty 
• 
"what's the context"

Room guides are slightly awkward with him – has to do with his questions? Oddly 
wording some of them 
• 
Man lots of people are interested in the Eagle statute thing 
• 
Pausing on the staircase to look at the paintings 
• 
Started to reach for the banister but stopped – decorations? 
• 
Oh he is ITCHING to talk to the room guide in the queen's room about Frank Green

The room guide is talking about the dichotomy of working for Frank Green 
• 
"how did he die?" 
• 
Avoiding gaze of the male room guide 
• 
Is he a megalomaniac

Might have been gay

Asked about how he treated his servants

Interested in the Royal connection as well

Very comfortable around the male room guide – following him around

Asking about Frank's sexuality 
• 
More of a vague thing than any actual evidence e 
• 
Spending a LOT of time in the queen's room 
• 
Chatting with him about Gloucester now 
• 
Has only said thank you to one room guide so far, and it was immediately after I had 
said it to the previous one 
• 
Gets SUPER close to the things but doesn't quite touch

Looking at the clock again

He likes tapestry

It's very phisophical 
• 
Philosophical

Got out the magnifying glass for the needlepoint 
• 
He's examining it very closely 
• 
Some people were struggling to get up the stairs

Really examining the stairs

Prefers the older tour guides

Couldn’t tell where the entrance was 
Audit 
1. Once the signs were there – the building itself was fine 
2. Not really 
3. Odd layout – knew where to walk to, would have missed the study/office area and 
beyond 
4. Pretty small – just look at the item itself 
5. Yes

7. Yes 
8. Yes 
9. Yes – little drain thing was a trip hazard 
10. Yes – good answer, led to nice discussion 
11. Yeah 
12. Interactive was good – better understanding, likes touch aspect 
13. Not everywhere – just everything could be difficult

17. Fine – good noise cancelling (from outside) 
18. No 
19. No 
20. Not bad overall (in parts)

25. Better than the rest – not bad 
26. Yes – the one he did get 
27. Not bad 
28. Good 
29. Didn’t notice 
General questions 
1. Interactive – not many museums are 
2. Boards – frustrating very draining 
3. - 
1. Sound was relatively okay (volume, noise quality); good for colour blindness; 
interactive – more senses involved, other senses to rely on 
2. Boards were hard to read; mobility limitations; steps are slanty (inform people 
somehow? Like with the threshold signs) 
4. Steps, thresholds, many stairs in general 
5. - 

541 
 
1. Audio component (able to listen to info rather than read) 
2. Boards could be designed better – consistency, matte material, even in low 
light, things would be better 
6. - 
1. Friendly, welcomed, just a thing 
2. No – just a thing – no hassle, friendly enough 
7. Probably – interesting place

people in, less about the enjoyment once inside 
1. Spacious exhibits, better furnishings, evidence of investment 
b. 
Non-paying – sharing the info 
1. Friendlier – there because they WANT to be  
c. 
That being said, Barley Hall was quite friendly 
Tired – less likely to read

a. 
Fairly steady 
b. 
But also it limits capabilities

May review how she pays for things 
• 
Used to quibble over paying

Residents weekend – likes to plan things, but often feeling lousy and then doesn’t 
follow through

Concentrate with this colour contrast

Wants dates 
• 
Rather than eras

Map would have been helpful to conceptualise the layout

Bit noisy but not too disruptive

544

In the parlour 
• 
Nice chat about textiles through time

VERY dark in the buttery and pantry 
• 
Didn't go into the pantry probs because of the step 
• 
Loved the building puzzld 
• 
Horn spoons are still used for eating eggs 
• 
Tbh the school was less obnoxious than the two 20somethings that were 
visiting 
• 
Limped a bit after going up the back stairs 
• 
Kinda braced hersrlf to go down the stairs 
• 
Migrated towards the shelf stuff in the gift shop

Lovely interaction with Sarah on the desk – checking stock of tea towel 
• 
Paul was quite helpful too

• 
Went to Japanese tea shop on Blake Street 
3.3. Post-visit interview. 
• 
Fine to finds – looked on google maps 
• 
Easy to find the entrance 
• 
Flow was alright – signs help, small site 
• 
Gift shops are always strange – how it is linked, didn’t really read the signs 
• 
Enough space, easy to navigate, easy to find toilet 
• 
CLean – bit of a wet day, so clean enough 
• 
No difference in attitude 
• 
Might have been more helpful with a visible disability 
• 
Welcomed – not too many staff on view 
• 
Not always – hard to read white – not always well lit 
• 
Not the best font 
• 
Not light on dark 
• 
Good level of noise 
• 
Didn’t get the story of the HOUSE – bit of day to day life but not a full picture 
• 
Noise levels were fine – quite like the quiet 
• 
Some places were too dark especially when stepping into a room, light is needed 
• 
Lots of benches 
• 
Lots of stuff on display – more about the feel of the place, left to work it out yourself – 
maybe the guide book would have helped? 
• 
Lighting was nice and bright in the Great Hall 
• 
Easy to get from BB parking 
• 
Not easy to read 
• 
Toilets on ground floor – easy to open door 
• 
Some kind of grab rail would be appreciated 
• 
Tiled floor is a bit uneven – easier to stumble 
• 
Walking frame/cane ma help 
• 
Raising lights in general 
• 
Info as you enter – handheld signs, info on the room As you enter the room 
• 
Cushion on hard benches was a nice touch 
• 
Friendly – bit embarrassing about the whole price issue 
o 
Sort out the issue later, slightly embarrassing 
o 
Fed up by that point 
• 
York is a medieval city – I accept that but things like a step into the building make it 
obvious 

545 
 
o 
Don’t need to over compensate – the ramp for example took away from the 
experience – let’s find a way to make it fit with the rest of the building 
o 
Good for a family on a wet afternoon 
o 
Not a lot to grab your attention 
o 
Nothing that made it really stand out 
o 
Great for children and families 
o 
They need a Middleham Jewel – a star object that draws people in 
o 
Nothing extra really 
o 
There’ a lot of medieval history in York – needs something special 
o 
Wouldn’t visit again 
▪ 
Would go to a special event 
▪ 
Would take someone if they were visiting and were particularly 
interested 
3.4. Follow-up interview. 
• 
Went to the garden centre over the weekend, going out for lunch that day 
• 
Next day (it was cold and damp) 
o 
Relaxed for the afternoon 
o 
Might have been poorly but not linked 
o 
Nice and relaxed 
• 
Knotted rope hanging in doorways?? Instead of grab rails 
• 
Likes to visit special exhibitions – read everything 
o 
Once in a lifetime experience 
• 
More of a looker in places like Barley Hall 
o 
Reads things that are interesting 
o 
Revisits favourite objects 
o 
Not always clear how the labels associate 
o 
Crete – Hanya – Roman museum – post card info 
• 
Temperature – would have cancelled on bad days – might have skipped 
o 
Have to cancel sometimes 
o 
Nice family who is very will to help – going with someone elsse is helpful 
• 
Temperature had more of an impact – not a lot of natural light 
o 
Info sheet that’s portable 
• 
Go with a friend who was keen 
o 
Liked special events 
• 
So much stuff in York, you reall need to stand out 
• 
More like a resource for schools, good for tourists 
o 
Easy to understand way of presenting information 
o 
Burton Agnes – adds a certain extra element as the family is still there, 
deeper connection knowing that it’s still an active house 
o 
Liked the restoration, but not the same continuity 
▪ 
Give a bit more of an experience of the actual room – less exhibition 
• 
Richmond Castle (Mary Queen of Scots was held here) – connection to actual people 
through objects 
• 
Non-paying vs paying is an interesting topic 
o 
Non-paying are a wider audience 
o 
Paying are smaller, need more of a push to grab people in 
▪ 
Scottish Art Gallery 
▪ 
Families don’t have to worry about paying 
o 
Rail Museum as a pseudo day care 
▪ 
Only non-paying place 
• 
Edinburgh Festival 
o 
Exhausting after one day 
o 
Art gallery outside of town 

546 
 
o 
Lots of effort to get there 
• 
Buggies 
o 
Hire them at the site 
o 
Railway stations could offer them 
4. Amy. 
4.1. Pre-visit interview. 
• 
Hypermobility syndrome 
o 
Involves pain, stiffness in joints 
o 
Hip dislocates, which can impede mobility 
o 
Knee pain – just walks a bit slower 
o 
Almost fused joints (sorta the opposite of hypermobility, which was a younger 
thing) 
o 
Shorter steps 
o 
Hard to write – can write about half a postcard and then it gets painful 
o 
Plans ahead – if having a long lecture the next day, doesn’t write late at night 
o 
A doer – difficult to hold back and therefore manage the condition 
▪ 
Pushes through the pain and discomfort on holidays because it’s such 
a unique experience 
o 
Sitting on a bus is hard – need to move 
▪ 
Can’t sit with knees against the back of the seat as it puts pressure on 
that joint 
o 
Recently diagnosed with scoliosis – which also involves sciatica 
o 
Can’t sit in one spot for very long 
o 
Injured coccyx 
o 
Basically a physical (hidden) mess 
o 
The HMS may be related to something deeper, but no diagnosis 
▪ 
However, she’s very convinced of it 
• 
Mental Health 
o 
Mental exhaustion is a big thing 
o 
Anxiety loves to make her overthink – it’s so tiring 
o 
So much overthinking – logically know it’s not the end of the world, but 
anxiety doesn’t listen to logic 
o 
It does, however, involve lots of planning to make sure things are prepared for 
o 
Obsession-oriented 
▪ 
Food especially – ‘safe’ foods 
▪ 
Brain refuses to accept certain foods are food, like unprocessed meat 
or vegetables (only processed ones are safe!) 
▪ 
Worry about other people’s safety 
▪ 
If they don’t answer right away, immediately assumes they’re 
dead 
▪ 
At least it’s not depression conclusions 
o 
Intrusive thoughts are big – not extreme as in ‘I could push someone in front 
of a train’ but more realistic ones like ‘I could lick their hand’ or ‘I could shout 
out in the middle of a test’ 
▪ 
Somehow more terrifying because they’re more realistic 
o 
Fatigue is big – especially from joint pain 
▪ 
Needs a solid 9-10 hours of sleep, and even then that’s not always 
enough 
o 
Mental exhaustion vs physical exhaustion 
▪ 
Can often power through it but it’s not good 

547 
 
▪ 
Sometimes have the physical energy but not the mental; vice verse as 
well 
o 
Life is much harder this year than last year but nothing more has been added 
on 
• 
Getting ready 
o 
Lots of balance is required – can’t carrying too much (back problems) but 
need enough to feel secure 
▪ 
OCD is overpacking? 
o 
Items 
▪ 
Diet coke (jolt of caffeine and sugar) 
▪ 
Water 
▪ 
Book – calming tactic, safety net 
▪ 
Pain killers 
o 
Check weather – cold has a big impact 
o 
Prepare the night before – hard time waking up, so chronically late to things 
o 
Check how outdoors the place is (for temp) 
o 
See if there’s a café – blood sugar can drop very fast (if no café, then bring a 
small snack) 
o 
Uses the museum website to check normal things 
▪ 
Hours 
▪ 
Location 
▪ 
Mostly looking at photos 
▪ 
SOMETIMES checks Trip Advisor but mostly for photos 
▪ 
Normally hard to find the prices?? Especially if there’s a student price 
o 
Tries to minimise walking 
▪ 
Plans a route – could 2 buses work? Could just take an Uber? 
o 
Hates using trackpads – DSA gave her a mouse and WOW a whole new 
world 
o 
Uses sticky stretchy athletic tape 
o 
Been advised NOT to use a stick – moves pain to her wrists rather than 
getting rid of it 
▪ 
But it’d also worsen the scoliosis as it would lean her to one side 
▪ 
Would need to use two crutches – but then wouldn’t have hands free 
and therefore couldn’t really do anything else 
▪ 
Not ready for that at this point 
▪ 
Not a pride point 
▪ 
Would prefer to use something like that as people would notice 
she has a disability 
▪ 
Example: visited Tower of London and there was a 2 hour 
queue, but she wouldn’t be able to stand that long. Talked to a 
Beefeater, explained her disability and that she simply can’t 
stand that long, and they let her do a queue jump (very 
understanding staff, but felt judged by other people – anxiety 
brain?) 
▪ 
Same with using an accessible toilet – has to do with leg space 
– worried that people will be judging her for using it without a 
visible disability 
o 
All the preplanning really is for possible eventualities 
▪ 
Low blood sugar 
▪ 
Pain flare 
▪ 
Tiredness 
▪ 
Lets friends know if she’s having a rough day (ie, cranky because 
depression, needs to go a little slow today, etc.) 
o 
Goes to museums alone a lot 
o 
Checks for certain eventualities 

548 
 
▪ 
Rain 
▪ 
Eczema – types of clothing 
▪ 
Snacks 
▪ 
Water 
o 
Takes about 5-20 minutes of research, depending on museum 
o 
Night before takes 5-60 minutes 
▪ 
Constantly checking bag 
▪ 
Worrying about temperature control 
▪ 
Anxiety brain 
▪ 
Lays out clothing (sometimes several options) night before 
4.2. Site visit. 
• 
There is in fact a green sign, though not quite the kind that Ellie was talking about 
• 
Much quieter than it was on Friday 
• 
Amy likes to stand on a person's left hand side 
• 
More overcast day 
• 
Quite low lighting 
• 
Not a whole lot of natural light 
• 
Wandering between people no problem 
• 
Unsure if she could pick up the chairs have eyes sign 
• 
People are taking boards and basically standing there 
• 
Ellie skipped the dining room 
• 
Went STRAIGHT for another sign 
• 
FINALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE COULD SIT ON A CHAIR 
• 
Like having multiple copies of the same hand held board 
• 
LOVED the tree 
• 
Only one in the blue drawing room and the guide was a bit too awkward to talk 
• 
LOVE the little touch of the champagne glasses 
• 
Quite outgoing and had no problem going up to the room guide 
• 
Talking about the style of furniture – country of style and time era 
• 
Talked about the lighting again – ambiance, conservation, etc. 
• 
VERY personable 
• 
Went and sat while talking to the room guide, had no problem doing it 
• 
Quite upfront about her disability 
• 
Taking down the name of Frank Green 
• 
And we're talking about the ghosts 
• 
The popular roman soldiers first of all 
• 
Cyril is the room guide 
• 
She had heard the story as a young child and knew the basics of it 
• 
Talked especially about the clothing of soldiers and the "proof" 
• 
Talked about another one in the upstairs 
• 
A ghost who sits in the chair 
• 
Who appears to children 
• 
Admits people like to hear about the ghost stories 
• 
In the tapestry room 
• 
Cyril clearly likes these stories – treading a line between believing and not believing 
• 
And another ghost story from another NT property 
• 
In Wales 
• 
From his sister 
• 
Five or six family groups have gone through the room while we've been here 
• 
Absolutely lovely chat 
• 
Comment on the banister garland again 
• 
Far less room guides today too 
• 
Asking about ghost stories from the tapestry room 

549 
 
• 
New ghost story! Someone was murdered in this room 
• 
Kinda wandered off in the middle of the conversation 
• 
Asking questions of basically every room guide 
• 
Not SUPER chatty guide but still nice 
• 
Stopped at the top of the strairs 
• 
Confusion over layout 
• 
Prefers asking questions to the guides than reading the answers 
• 
Wants instructions! Too much freedom 
• 
VERY confusing to get in and out of the toilets, but also a very heavy door 
• 
Same problem with the sign on the register 
4.3. Post-visit interview. 
• 
Eh on signposts – used google maps, not the easiest place to find, more signs would 
be helpful 
• 
Roughly knew the location 
• 
One way walking systems feel more secure – not super easy to find a path there; 
would like a more guided path 
• 
William and Mary staircase was nice to get up – shallow steps, wide passage 
• 
Great Hall staircase was quite narrow – couldn’t pass people but at least one way 
direction 
• 
Gift shop stairs VERY narrow – for both up and down, good bannisters though 
• 
Spacious rooms, not too much in the way 
o 
Family portrait room was a bit smaller but no danger of bottleneck 
• 
Has a hard time NOT going her own speed as it can be painful to be sped up or 
slowed down 
1. Not really 
2. Didn’t immediately notice 
3. Okay but maybe a bit more structure? Not a map, but a trail disguising a map would 
be good; needs to be ‘markable’ so she can check off rooms 
4. Put a sheet over the till because it doesn’t look ‘closed’  
5. Not big, but fine for when we went 
6. Yeah 
7. No 
8. Yes 
9. Probably was 
10. Bit awkward, didn’t cross his mind to be more audible 
11. Answered questions nicely, didn’t really ask for help but certainly asked questions 
12. Yeah 
13. Yes – not much written – liked the oddities trail – not obvious locations, so perhaps 
missed some, liked the multiple copies 
14. Yes 
15. Quite dark so didn’t help – maybe bigger font to mitigate the darkness – good that it’s 
not text based 
16. Loud enough – mix on the Roman video was bad, sounded like audio feedback 
17. Family portrait room was a bit difficult to follow 
18. Yeah – doesn’t like it too quiet where the only sound are own footsteps – ticking 
clocks were annoying 
19. Perhaps the café? 
20. Blue drawing room – but it didn’t feel too bad, it was very atmospheric – not too 
solemn 
21. Liked it – like it a bit darker 
1. Has an eye muscle strain thing – muscle ache (it’s normal eye strain, but 
more susceptible to it) 
2. Too bright or too dark lighting can be a trigger 

550 
 
22. No 
23. Frst room – fireplace room; also blue drawing room – made it calmer, plus nothing to 
read 
24. Yes but hard to find – lack of places to lean or even rest a bag – “please touch” signs 
would be really nice, unsure on whether could touch tables or not 
25. Whoops 
26. I 
27. Skipped 
28. These 
29. Questions 
30. Will 
31. Ask later 
32. + room guides, – decorations on the banister 
33. + hand held cards, – toilet adventure (REALLY heavy door, no phone signal in the 
bathroom but also no red cord which could be an issue if you need to call for help), 
no toilet check signs 
34. How long it took to get to the toilet – also no signs through the rest of the house 
35. Wore gloves all the way around – liked to pick up the signs and the small side 
banister on W&M staircase 
36. Changing a few little things: 
1. Bannisters – making sure they’re clear 
2. Not crowding the top or bottom of stairs 
1. Jester’s window – felt crowded with so many signs so people wanted 
to stop and linger there, made it back up 
Wanted to know more about the gnome trail – stand with leaflets or something 
No 
Welcome – sometimes guides can be enthusiastic but ignore any feedback, these room 
guides were more conversational than lecturing 
Liked to have been treated differently – sitting especially, notice little things 
Yes – could have been more involved 
Yeah 
Banister decorations, bathroom door 
4.4. Follow-up interview. 
25. Yeah 
26-27. No text – good with guide, didn’t see boards – sent photo 
28. Mentioned the lower lights – with the guide; bit of history about the ceiling, not prompter 
29. Bit quiet but chatting with the guide was fine 
30. Like the darkness 
 
Chilled atmosphere – glasses can reflect the light, so she could have sat and enjoyed 
the atmosphere easily 
31. Not obvious – sat on a window bench – obvious where you COUDLN’T sit, not as 
obvious where you could 
• 
Had a weird dream that night 
• 
Not a massive impact from HMS – out of breath, obvious oversight 
• 
Really liked the eyes in the chairs

551 
 
o 
Experience it through someone else’s eyes 
o 
Nothing else for the day if bad 
o 
Need enough rest  
1. Yes visit again 
2. Fairly standard – going to someone’s house 
3. Museum in Dublin – how they display humans remains 
1. Warning ahead of time – info outside the room, no info with the body itself (it’s 
a body, not an artefact) 
4. Yes – expect more from paying 
1. Should be relevant to the time spent 
2. Based on the worth 
3. Treasurer’s HouseE was more than expected – student rate? 
5. Situationally determined 
1. According to the government and ‘official’ diagnosis 
2. Depends on the day 
3. Something is disabling me 
4. Not an adjective 
5. PwD – not always disabled 
6. Constantly disabled by _____ 
7. Have a Disability moment each day 
• 
Prefer hand dryers – little bit of a warm up 
• 
Take hand dryers out of accessible toilets?

Bit too big, bit too heavy 
• 
Bit awkward to handle 
• 
Like that there are multiple ones 
• 
Images and text are a good combo 
• 
Quite obvious too when you walk in 
• 
Struggling to take the words in but it's going straight out 
• 
More of a brain fog and distraction thing 
• 
There is a quite chatty room guide that's a bit loud 
• 
Ghost mention 1! 
• 
Lots of info but can skim through it 
• 
Presented nicely in terms of how the information is laid out 
• 
Even with a cane, no one pointed out where to sit 
• 
Taking it quite slowly 
• 
Meandering towards the sign holder thing 
• 
Happily glancing through all the panels 
• 
Quite busy today actually 
• 
8 people in the first room, 6 people in the second 
• 
Good lighting in the great hall – bright and atmospheric without being artificial 
or too dark 
• 
Struggling with the lights in the sitting room 
• 
Very intense light in a small bulb 
• 
Windows are shuttered now so it's a bit darker 
• 
Blue drawing room is the name of this room 

553 
 
• 
Small but intense light 
• 
Hard to transition from the corridor to the blue drawing room because of the 
light difference 
• 
I just really like that touch 
• 
Guides are very much interacting with the older visitors, kinda just nodding at 
us 
• 
William and Mary staircase chat 
• 
Change in the light level is hard to adjust 
• 
More consistent lighting would be helpful 
• 
Really struggled with the drawing room 
• 
Changing light is just tough 
• 
Consistent internal lighting would make it easier to enjoy and read 
• 
Mildly disappointed in the lack of history for the object (see above photo) 
• 
Pretty but also makes it difficult to actually USE the banister 
• 
Talking about the deafness of Queen Alexandra 
• 
And how her younger daughter stayed with her, likely as a carer 
• 
Never less than 4 people BESIDES US in a room 
• 
Def eavesdropping on the room guides 
• 
Another mention of Queen Alexandra and her deafness 
• 
Flat out said Zeus raped Leah 
• 
In those words 
• 
Which on one hand is accurate 
• 
On the other hand trigger warning omg 
• 
Upstairs is better 
• 
Easier to navigate 
• 
Feels clearer 
• 
Has a focal point in each room with a bed, makes it easier to move around 
• 
Finally had a room guide speak to us but we were also the only ones in the 
room 
• 
Bahaha though the little old lady is arguing that the tray doesn't look like a 
tray 
• 
Definitely TRYING to be interested 
• 
Ellie moved in on a conversation instead of asking and the guide took the hint 
• 
Not an official flow 
• 
Not sure if like it or not 
• 
Feel a bit lost and rudderless 
• 
Need to make sure the garland isn't tied AROUND the banister but rather TO 
the banister 
• 
Some confusion over the layout from another group of visitors 
• 
Finally spoke with a room guide! 
• 
Once again the room guide is taking the lead and not waiting to be asked, 
instead just talking 
• 
Yessssssss got a question in 
• 
Asked about the wallpaper 
• 
Decoration painted directly ON the paper 
• 
Low light for the textiles 
• 
Very interested in the textiles and the needlework 
• 
WOW interested in the textiles 
• 
Can tailor your own experience 
• 
Still haven't seen ANYONE sit in the acceptable chairs except for the lost 
houses room and the obvious settee in the middle of the room 
• 
Feels like a good point to take a moment and just ponder 
• 
Nice and neutral, nice stopping point 
• 
Someone sat on one of the benches again in the neutral hall 
• 
Again saw someone sitting on a wooden bench in the cellar 

554 
 
• 
It's clearly a seat you can use 
• 
Ellie finally sat – took the headphones off 
• 
Just watched the video partially 
• 
Bit of confusion about where to pay for things but it was handled efficiently 
and nicely 
5.3. Post-visit interview. 
• 
Already knew where it was – initial sign helped and then it was easier after 
• 
No green metal street signs 
o 
Actually, there is (INSERT PHOTO) 
• 
Fairly easy – Christmas market crowd 
1. Yes 
2. Yes 
3. Not realy – bit more guidance, especially up in great hall upstairs 
4. No – “please pay upstairs” sign – no way to get attention 
5. Yes 
6. Yes 
7. Ffairly 
8. Could have been better 
9. Ditto – hard to find the light switch – dark immeiately on entering 
10. No 
11. Yeah – room guides 
12. Yes 
13. Once the theme were understood, it was good – maybe needs an intro board? 
14. Yes 
15. Yeah 
16. Roman – really loud 
17. Panel – yeah 
18. Little noisy – first fireplace room 
19. Fireplace room 
20. Never! 
21. Not good – variable  
1. Conservation, sure, but CONSISTENCY 
2. Natural vs. artificial 
22. Blue Drawing room – intensity of light 
23. Blue Drawing room – too intense in small bursts 
24. Not in downstairs in Great Hall 
25. Needed more light to be sure 
26. Yes 
27. Yes 
28. Yeah 
29. Good 
30. BAD 
31. No 
• 
Quite achy – short walk, then stand over and over – tough on joints 
• 
Blue Drawing room – migraine trigger potential 
• 
Difficult to curate the multistrand narrative 
o 
Pick and choose your levels of engagement 
o 
No obtrusive sign boards 
• 
Lighting 
• 
Quieter space – nice decompression space (sensory space) – intentional? 
• 
Decorations on banister 
• 
Options for visually impaired – not offered on arrival – only one method of presenting 
info 

555 
 
o 
Physical accessibility  
▪ 
Understandable, but how to mitigate? 
• 
Not really provided access tools 
• 
Needs an audio element 
• 
Multisensory is really important – balance between text and image (some boards 
were super text heavy) – think about how people move around museums 
o 
Didn’t realise there was anoter staircase in the Great Hall at firsst 
• 
Used walking stick 
• 
Really nice room guides, welcoming, admissions too 
o 
Felt like a bit of a nuiscence in the shop – seemed impatient 
• 
No 
• 
Possibly not – maybe at a ticket desk if needed more help 
• 
Yeah – when less brain foggy 
• 
Lighting – makes a big difference 
o 
Reading can get very tiring very quickly 
5.4. Follow-up interview. 
• 
Really exhausted the next day – quite surprising, didn’t expect to be that tired 
• 
Lighting is still a bit issue – quite prominent 
• 
Lighting was a bigger thing than the fibro – longer lasting impact 
o 
Could have a seat if super necessary, but can’t do anything for a migraine 
• 
Fibro biggest impact – physical aspect 
o 
Stop and go is hard 
o 
Used to movement but the change in energy and momentum is hard 
▪ 
Hips and knees especially 
• 
Slightly too big on the handheld panels – design and content and intent were spot on 
o 
Surprisingly heavy – size related? 
• 
Decorations – not a HUGe thing but a potentially big issue 
• 
Don’t tend to check accessibility guides 
o 
Look more at photos to get a feel 
o 
Basic overview on the admissions page tells her what she needs to know 
(wheelchair accessible throughout, etc) 
• 
Tapestry room – revisit just for that 
o 
Without the christmas decor though 
• 
Reminded her of Temple Newsam – mixture of period rooms (Tudor room, later 
periods, change between eras) 
o 
General stately home experience 
• 
Changed going upstairs – would have just skipped that on a bad fibro day 
• 
Migraine – would have avoided the Blue Drawing Room 
• 
Anxious – would have avoided interaction with the room guides 
o 
Not too bad on the day 
o 
Normal expectation of nervousness 
• 
Yes disabled – taken a while to accept 
o 
Identifies as a person with a disability 
o 
Not a conscious thing 
• 
It’s the little things – Leeds City Gallery has lots of interactives and different senses 
engaged 

556 
 
6. James. 
6.1. Pre-visit interview. 
• 
Everything hurts 
•

Comes and goes 
• 
Variable 
• 
Today is a medium day

Spoon method – grade your actions accordingly

Work has been understanding – moved to less movement position, cushion, touch 
screen pen

Batch cooking rather than every night 
• 
Little things like that help 
• 
Alexis – turns on lightswitches 
o 
Wifi lightbulbs 
o 
Voice control things 
• 
Thought it was just age – until diagnosises 
o 
More and more time off 
• 
Couldn’t understand why the pain 
o 
No test for it 
o 
Have to eliminate everything else (MS, arthritis) 
o 
Added stress 5-6 years 
• 
Gillian Tilsey – off on full pay, full hours 
o 
Felt good at the time, even if it’s the law 
• 
“Gee, what CAN I do as a Viking?” 
o 
Scared of losing job 
o 
Work has been amazing 
• 
Health-wise is helping to control 
• 
First of all okay – just cancel plans if pain is too bad 
• 
Depends on the size of the museum 
• 
Mentally prepare for it and deal with it 
• 
Like to be surprised – not a lot of research beforehand 
• 
Familiar with York – know what to expect 
• 
Sometimes changes throughout 
• 
Uses a stick 
• 
Not a lot of planning – use a smart phone – good support structure 
• 
Not long to get ready 
• 
Depends on pain level – nothing significant, about 20 minutes 
6.2. Site visit. 
• 
No handrail 
• 
QUITE a fast walker

Having a quick look around

Uh oh my battery is going fast 
• 
Ghost mention 2!

Noticed the sittable chairs

No real flow to the house

Mentioned banister

Sat down in the Princess room 
• 
Room guide walked over with us to speak 
• 
Room guide wearing a cardigan

Bit colder than last time

Bit busier but not as much as last Friday 
• 
Another room guide with a coat on 
• 
Likes these chairs quite a lot 
• 
Room guide has a torch and a buzzer around her neck (not sure what the 
neck thing is) 
• 
Might be a portable hearing loop? 
• 
Used the torch to show the tortoise shell in the cabinet 
• 
More of a looker than a reader, prefers to chat with the room guides (how he 
learns? How he's trained at JORVIK?) 
• 
Another room guide with a coat 
• 
Last room guide had a gilet 
• 
Nice an level floors 
• 
Good to have these available at the beginning

25. Yes 
26. n/a 
27. n/a 
28. Yeah 
29. Fine 
30. Bit low but fine 
31. Can’t remember – probably not 
1. Probably not enough for a busy day 
2. Feel wrong taking a seat from another (more obviously) disabled person 
32. - 
1. Volunteers – very engaging, very friendly, on it 
2. Lack of handrails – pretty but impractical 
33. - 
1. No trip hazards 
2. Handrail

Achy, expected levels

JVC – chairs to take around 
• 
Chocolate story 
• 
Yes – pay – more expectations 
o 
Don’t agree with non-paying 
o 
Charitable donations 
o 
Paid for – income 
• 
Not done with stairs 
o 
Chair lift? Ways around it 
• 
Barley Hall tablet 
o 
VR – more immersive 
o 
Interactive way of exploring 
• 
Funding is always an issue 
• 
Some kind of scheme – help poorer (social inclusivity) 
• 
Maybe children are free? Tricky balance for income vs charity 

559 
 
7. Jessica. 
7.1. Pre-visit interview. 
• 
Dyslexia – learn in a different way, spelling, reading, homonyms 
• 
Irlens Syndrome – light sensitive, harsh lighting 
• 
Lots of text is tough 
• 
Colour overlay 
• 
Software – read texts on a machine – good for editing/proofreading 
• 
Didn’t get diagnosed until last year 
• 
Just need extra tools 
• 
Sad at first, but relieved now 
• 
Preparation 
o 
Context of museum – scaffolding for herself 
o 
Videos are helpful – audio is better to learn by 
o 
Youtube, podcasts, documentary 
o 
Audio guides – no extra cost is best 
o 
Learn better through audio 
o 
TripAdvisor – see when it’s less busy 
▪ 
Wants to take more time, and will feel less guilty about doing so 
o 
Headsets can be TOO popular and have queues, which puts her off 
o 
Treasurer’s House 
▪ 
Headsets 
▪ 
Website is hard to navigate 
▪ 
Not a lot of good info on the House itself 
▪ 
No audio guide but saw headsets 
▪ 
Wikipedia was good for background info 
▪ 
Uses youtube for videos, but there were none on Treasurer’s House 
▪ 
Read aloud for info 
▪ 
TripAdvisor – actuallly has lots of access stuff, good to learn about the 
atmosphere 
• 
Colour overlay – on laptop 
• 
Pocket size overlay 
o 
Embarrassed using it though 
o 
Backlighting on panels is HORRIFIC 
o 
If it’s too busy or not accomodating, not a long visit as it’s not engaging 
o 
Headaches are a thing – passed out from harsh lights before 
• 
About 20 minutes of research per museum 
• 
Keeps notes about museums for longer trips on phone – up to an hour of research 
for longer trips 
7.2. Site visit. 
• 
Start from her flat 
• 
Using Google maps 
• 
Made it 
• 
Reminds her of a place she went to in Barnley 
• 
Looking at a card 
• 
Quite dark 
• 
Colour of the card is quite nice because its ivory 
• 
Really weird font on the pull out cards 
• 
Really hard to concentrate 

560 
 
• 
Off white is good 
• 
Image isn't in between the text 
• 
Bold doesn't help with reading 
• 
Underline instead? 
• 
But she is looking through all the pull out cards 
• 
Standing near the stand though 
• 
Light is quite dim 
• 
Reading through the cards 
• 
Glancing through, reading the starts of paragraphs but lighting isn't helping 
with concentration 
• 
Light is shining on the laminated sheets and making it impossible to read 
• 
Lots of bold and italics 
• 
Wouldn't bother reading 
• 
Probably just go home and read more about it 
• 
Natural light is nice 
• 
Doesn't look too overwhelming 
• 
Would read it online 
• 
The numbers are helpful 
• 
Numbered pdfs? 
• 
Download it to your phone 
• 
Could read it in her own time 
• 
More engaging 
• 
Overlay helps to keep place when reading too 
• 
Overlay is much better for stuff that is picked up 
• 
Like my own personal text panel 
• 
Too many colours now 
• 
All she can see is the white, very distracting 
• 
Asked about the lighting in the sitting room – conservation and energy 
• 
Good explanations 
• 
Nice and chatty, comfortable and easy with her 
• 
Very personable 
• 
Natural lighting through the windows is very nice 
• 
But it doesn't extend too far in 
• 
They keep it dark for conservation reasons but also to recreate what it would 
have been like when Frank Green was here 
• 
He didn't have electricity, only candles 
• 
The Sheen of laminated stuff is just awful 
• 
Also looks so tatty 
• 
Needs clean layouts 
• 
Not pics in between text blocks 
• 
Instead of bold, larger font? Less thick bold? 
• 
Borders instead of different background colour 
• 
Difficult to differentiate between sittable and non sittable chairs 
• 
Lighting in ship room is really hard to see 
• 
Some confusion over route 
• 
Quite heavy 
• 
Text panels 
• 
Balancing with the overlay is quite tricky 
• 
Audio?? 
• 
Nothing about the weird table on the panels 

561 
 
• 
Reads well outloud with her overlay 
• 
Only one small swap of words in the last sentence 
• 
Room guides were chatting with someone who likely had down syndrome and 
they were very patient and welcoming 
• 
The steps in the garden were too hard for him 
• 
Text is in chunks, so it's not so bad 
• 
Wouldn't be able to put overlay on that, but doesn't really need to either 
• 
Kngs room is very dark 
• 
Alt text on the images is greatly appreciated!!!! Her screen reader picks them 
up 
• 
A lot lighter in the last room, easier to read the text on the wall 
• 
Sat down for the first time, it was obvious she could sit? 
• 
Good lay out, enjoyable to read, nice and bright, doesn't need the overlay for 
this 
• 
The cream is quite nice 
• 
The brown text is easier to read 
• 
Brown is more enjoyable to read than black text 
• 
Example above – very small difference, but it IS a difference 
• 
Darker in the corridor so it's harder to read 
• 
We aren't the only ones confused about the route 
• 
You don't need to put quotes in italics if they're already in quotation marks 
• 
Immediately drawn to the video in the kitchen 
• 
Leaned in to read the newspaper text on screen – was it long enough? 
• 
Yes she could read everything in the video just fine 
• 
With captions! 
• 
Absorb info better with audio 
• 
A nice break from so much reading, it's easier to learn 
• 
In the shop, mostly aimed at adults 
• 
Lots of gardening 
• 
Cute for Brenin and Rhiannon 
• 
Stood at the till for a moment, needed to get the lady's attention 
• 
She was very polite and nice and was working on arranging things in the 
shop, less pressure to buy on the customers 
• 
QUITE dark in the dining room with toilets 
• 
Confusion on how to get back out 
7.3. Follow-up interview. 
• 
Still hate the lighting 
o 
Huge issue 
o 
On a bright day but still tough 
o 
A dark day would have been awful 
• 
Great staff 
o 
Above and beyond  
o 
Really lovely 
o 
Good alternative to reading 
• 
Hand held, personal panel 
o 
Less obtrusive 
o 
Silver lining to the whole thing 
• 
Too difficult to revisit 
o 
Would do own research instead of revisiting 
• 
Gorthorpe Hall 

562 
 
o 
Similar lighting 
o 
General issue with manor homes – see Castle Howard 
o 
No modern additions 
• 
Minster Undercroft 
o 
Lots of light 
o 
Interaction  
o 
Hands on

Immersive 
o 
Do the reading in different ways 
• 
Liverpool Maritime and Slavery Museum 
o 
Lots of senses 
• 
Lots of different ways of presenting info 
o 
Listen, see, do, read, watch 
• 
Paying expected to be better 
o 
Non-paying, lower expectations 
o 
Paying for a service – needs to be a meaningful experience 
o 
Bit more lenient for lack 
o 
Perhaps not meaningful at Treasurer’s House 
o 
Online resources, audio guides 
• 
Dark day, headache 
o 
Bad day 
o 
Probs wouldn’t have changed much 
o 
Even at the brightest outside, probs still wouldn’t be enough 
• 
Disability SPECTRUM 
o 
Not that bad 
o 
Don’t have the “right” to use the word 
o 
Needed disability help – compared to peers 
o 
Don’t put it on job applications 
• 
People with disabilities – overt word 
8. Kasi & Teagan. 
8.1. Pre-visit interview. 
• 
Postural Tachycardia Syndrome – comorbid with EDS 
• 
Kasi – ADHD – spacing out a lot 
o 
Needs verbal information 
o 
Gets lost very easily 
o 
Right and left are confused 
o 
Can’t remember directions 
• 
Colour coded maps are helpful 
• 
Trip prep 
o 
Teagan – uses a tablet 
o 
Kasi – needs to know where bathrooms and food are 
o 
Looking at the time 
o 
Abbey HouseM site – no time on the access page, wants a layout of the 
museum 
▪ 
Wants how to get there on the access page  
▪ 
One handed typing 

563 
 
▪ 
Wants bus info on access page 
▪ 
Embedded maps 
▪ 
Again, wants site layout

• 
Canes? Mobility aids – braces (took pictures) 
8.2. Site visit. 
• 
Compression socks 
• 
Didn't check bus times so walked to train station 
• 
"DO YOU HAVE TO GO PEE ALREADY" 
• 
Lift out 
• 
Had to run to catch the next train 
• 
Carried stroller up and down stairs 
• 
Apples and peanut butter and Nutella for snacks 
• 
Brought water bottles 
• 
Organisation : use folders for each of the three meetings, will hold things better 
• 
Maybe folder for each participant? 
• 
Laminate instruction sheets 
• 
Wrong train tickets – missed first train, caught one five minutes later, conductor didn't 
care (possibly because baby?) 
• 
My temp access needs: anemia, both symptoms and medication 
• 
"recording shirt" with pocket 
• 
Showed wrong ticket, conductor didn't care. Definitely the baby 
• 
Really hard to not jump in and help, either physically or with suggestions 
• 
Toilets at station out – person at desk told us to use some outside 
• 
Signage for toilets outside was fine but inside was a bit of a nightmare 
• 
Bus wardens were mindful of "if you're able to walk another five minutes, this will be 
helpful" 
• 
A MESS of bus stations outside, there's work going on 
• 
Not many noticeable employees inside, but outside there was loads 
• 
Bus arrive about 1025 
• 
Reeeeeally sketch item in gift shop 
• 
Automatically got the gate for us because stroller 
• 
Helpful when asked a question

Mostly flipped through interpretation to look at pics 
• 
Blinded by that – a spot light 
• 
Spent more time looking at the book of ONLY pics (portraits of the time) 
• 
Paused at the café to feed Annora 
• 
Woman was very helpful 
• 
No name tag though 
• 
Man it can get BORING following them around a museum 
• 
Though it's likely because Annora is slowing things up 
• 
11 stairs 
• 
Level throughout Upper story though 
• 
Lots of seating in almost all exhibits 
• 
No name tags on anyone 
• 
Steady but not busy, probably 20-30 other people in at the same time 
• 
Someone pulled the cord by accident and the person responded quickly, though 
there was an air of "here we go again" 
• 
But also it was just a dad with his kids doing a nappy change 
• 
Annoying that nappies must be disposed of in the accessible toilet 
• 
But they do call it the accessible toilet so there's that 
• 
WELP I dropped my booklet somewhere, that's okay, I think I can rebuild a lot of 
what I said in there from memory 

564 
 
• 
Yeah I def need a new phone battery especially for my visits to Leeds 
• 
920 train 1020 bus 1045 museum 
• 
1430 bus 
• 
1330 pub lunch 
• 
It is definitely time for my nap

Follow up questions : one thing to tell museum still the same, still wouldn't really

While we were there… 
o 
Sarah called reservations to handle an upgrade ticket – she had the agency to say 
“hey I don’t know how to do this” and Paul allowed her to contact Res to learn how 
to do it

o 
James had to turn away some walk-ins because of limited numbers; he explained the

Appendix E – Field Diaries. 
This appendix contains all the field diaries that were written throughout the course of data 
collection. Field diaries were written after meetings with participants to allow me a more 
reflective and reflexive way of thinking about our interviews and site visits. They are 
arranged alphabetically by participant’s name – except Teagan and Kasi, who are listed 
together. 
1. Aaron. 
1.1. First meeting. 
Aaron is an interesting character. A lot of his answers seemed rather rambling and I didn’t 
always follow how they related to the question. I will need to go back and re-listen to follow 
the logic. He also was extremely fatalistic about basically everything, but I think it’ll be good 
to have that point of view as well. Not everyone has to be understanding nor kind – it does 
make me wonder how fast his BPD cycles are, as you can almost track the rise and fall of 
his mood.  
2. Alfie. 
2.1. First meeting. 
I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Alfie. I’m really interested in exploring the intersection between 
his dyslexia and his vision, particularly as he has limited depth perception. I really enjoyed 
going around and checking the different labels with him – it was fascinating how things like 
margins impact how well he can read. But also, the fact that everything is so text heavy is 
really surprising, even though I’ve been through Barley Hall countless times. I just never 
realised it before.  
3. Amanda. 
3.1. First meeting. 
Amanda was a very lovely participant. She definitely spoke her mind and wasn’t afraid to be 
overly harsh about certain aspects of the visit. At the same time, she also didn’t hold back on 
herself, admitting that some of her own foibles and the fact that her pride is keeping her from 
getting more visible help for her disability.  
 
At the same time, she represents a very different type of museum visitor. As she said, she 
likes to go to places that have a ‘star item’ – but none of my case study sites really have one. 
They are more about providing an experience, an atmosphere. She likely would have 
preferred a more traditional, white box with glass cases kind of museum.  
 
You could certainly tell that she was getting more and more tired as the visit went on, and a 
few times she simply sat on one of the benches and just closed her eyes, breathing deeply. 
It was unclear if she was simply relaxing or taking a moment to control her pain. I didn’t see 

570 
 
her take any pain medication, though she did have both that and water on her the entire 
time. 
 
There was a bit of confusion in the shop when we left. The tea towel that she wanted was 
incorrectly priced, and the admissions staff was a bit perplexed, so she had called in the duty 
manager to help sort it out. Amanda started talking very loudly to me about her experience 
working in a charity shop where a similar thing happened, and how she handled it by just 
using the lower price and dealing with the problem later. While that is what eventually 
happened, she was clearly bothered by the whole situation. The entire interaction lasted a 
maximum of two minutes, from the moment she approached the till to the moment she was 
given her purchase and receipt, and there was no one else in the shop, but it was a sore 
point for her. She did say that everyone was helpful and lovely, though perhaps they could 
have dealt with it more efficiently to prevent embarrassment.  
 
I also think she might have an undiagnosed learning disability like dyslexia. She had 
problems reading the signage, and when pressed, agreed that it wasn’t the size of the font. 
She suggested using a different font, or a different colour scheme, both of which suggest 
dyslexia to me. She also said that the letters were blurry or bouncy to her, which again 
suggests dyslexia. Given that she is in her 60s, she likely wouldn’t have been diagnosed 
with it as a child and had to make her own accommodations to deal with it herself. It’s very 
possible that she doesn’t even think she had any learning disability, as this is how she’s 
been her entire life.  
 
Overall, the visit went really well. It was quite chilly and damp on the day, which was 
affecting me and I can only assume was affecting Amanda all the more. I think I need to 
make sure that the front of house staff member is instructed to ignore me, as I think her 
interaction with the admissions staff was slightly different than it would have been for another 
visitor. I don’t believe it made a big difference, but I want to make sure they receive an 
authentic experience and not one that is challenged by my presence. 
 
Also, there was a SEND school group in while we were. The ramp to the Great Hall was set 
up for them, and we were warned that they would be eating lunch there shortly so we should 
walk around it before they went in there. They were well behaved and I didn’t get a chance 
to see any staff interaction with them. Natalie did show up at one point, but I don’t know if 
that was related to the group or entirely coincidental.  
3.2. Second meeting. 
Amanda definitely represents a different type of museum visitor than most of my other 
participants so far. She was far more focused on ‘star objects’ – artefacts like the Middleham 
Jewel and things like that. I think she would feel more at home in a traditional white box, 
glass case museum, rather than the type of sites that I’m studying in this research. This 
could be another avenue of research for the future, as all of my sites are more immersive 
and experiential. However, I believe that a lot of the findings from this research will be 
equally applicable to those traditional museums as they are to my case study sites. It would 
be interesting to see if there are any specific accessibility issues related to the traditional 
museum layout – again, perhaps a future avenue of research. 
 
Talking with her more, it was now clear that the lighting was more of an annoyance than a 
true hindrance. However, I would still recommend revisiting lighting in some of the areas, 
particularly as the lighting in places like the pantry and buttery makes them uninviting to 
visitors. Also, if a place has written text, it’s vital that there are places with enough lighting to 

571 
 
read that text. Someone in a different interview mentioned spotlights on text panels as being 
helpful and a good compromise for conservation concerns – but also being able to pick up 
these interpretation panels and take them to an area with better light is a good shout, as 
Amanda pointed out. 
 
Her views on paying vs non-paying are REALLY interesting, as she put more expectations 
on the non-paying museum, whilst all my other participants so far have said the exact 
opposite. But I understand her logic – non-paying ones tend to be National museums, and 
also have external sources of funding, which then makes them seem better connected and 
financed than paying museums. I can see this being a generational difference, given that 
Amanda is older than my other participants so far. I’ll be interested to see how this trend 
continues in the future.  
4. Amy. 
4.1. First meeting. 
Amy is an absolute delight. She has more trouble with mental health issues than physical 
issues, I believe, but that’s partly what makes her insight so crucial. I don’t know the 
statistics off the top of my head, but my instincts say that more people are diagnosed with a 
mental illness now than a lot of chronic illnesses. It’s certainly a very prevelant thing, and 
knowing how to make museums mental illness friendly is going to be HUGE as we move 
forward. Also, it’s very heartening that she too is a heritage student, and that a lot of these 
access issues, she’s already thinking about.  
 
Our visit was very nice – there were a few times she needed to sit, and it was quite clear that 
there wasn’t necessarily a place for her to do so (not obviously at least). She was very 
interactive with the room guides, and was very upfront about her disabilities, despite them 
being invisible. It’s also helping me immensely in talking with her, as I have a similar set of 
mental health issues, and I’ve been struggling with whether or not they were disabilities. But 
the very fact that I do have to take medication in order to manage them proves that they 
have a significant, negative impact on my life, and therefore they’re disabling.  
 
I find it really interesting that she liked the lower light levels – she’s right that it adds to the 
ambiance, especially in the Blue Drawing room which is supposed to be just after a party. 
But also she wasn’t relying on written text, which she also admitted would need higher 
lighting levels. Finding that balance is going to be really interesting. 
4.2. Second meeting. 
Amy has been really insightful throughout the whole process. She’s very aware of her 
disabilities and their impact on her, and also how to manage them and the world around her. 
This has meant that she also has a lot of insight into how different places can adapt to 
increase their accessibility, as well as the problems inherent with it. 
 
It also sounds like she has an amazing support structure around her – she and her friends 
discuss accessibility in normal conversations, which is amazing. Their insight into removing 
loud hand dryers from accessible toilets doesn’t solve ALL problems, but it would certainly 
cut down on inaccessibility.  
 

572 
 
It’s very interesting that the banister is still something that bothers her – but it’s much more 
the meaning of it than the detail itself. It’s the fact that no one really thought the decorations 
through, that they simply assumed people wouldn’t need to use the handrail AS a handrail 
and not just as a decorative thing. This was actually borne out as I went around on multiple 
visits, as I saw a number of visitors go to use the handrail and pull back when they touched 
the decorations instead. 
5. Ellie. 
5.1. First meeting. 
I’m really really glad that I’ve chosen Ellie to go to all 3 sites. I think she’ll have some 
amazing insights and experiences to share. Also, her variety of disabilities – all hidden, but 
fibromyalgia does have a visible aspect with her stick sometimes – make things really 
interesting and show the wide range of accessibility options. She’s very quiet, which I think is 
much more to do with her personality than her anxiety, but she seems very comfortable 
around me. I’m really looking forward to building that rapport with her, and also revisiting 
some of her earlier answers to the questions in these interviews. 
 
Overall, our visit was fairly standard, as I’m coming to understand. Lighting is an issue, she 
didn’t know where she could sit, the staff was very lovely – these are very common themes, 
although it’s not necessarily across the board. However, it is showing that there are small 
little changes that could easily be made to make people more comfortable in the space.  
 
I find it really interesting that the flow has consistently come up. People are slightly confused 
where to go – and not just amongst my participants – and skip some rooms entirely. This 
was something that Teagan and Kasi had flagged up, but I’m noticing that the need for 
directions or at least some kind of spatial layout is common amongst people without 
dyslexia. 
 
The only really memorable moment that stands out in my mind is when we were paying in 
the shop, and there was a little exchange with the cashier. It was unclear where she should 
pay, as the café customers were paying in the shop, but the shop customers were being 
directed to pay upstairs. It very clearly rattled Ellie, and it came up in our interview as well. 
I’m not sure the system that’s in place right now, but it’s very confusing and needs to be 
revisited.  
5.2. Second meeting. 
One interesting thing that I asked Ellie was whether or not she checked access guides, and 
this is a question I want to start incorporating into my interviews. She said she didn’t, and it 
actually surprised me. Then again, I’m very steeped in what access guides include (or 
should include) and have a vested interest in the subject. So far, no one has said that they 
actually check them. On one hand, this is a bit disheartening to me, given all the work I’ve 
put into ours, but on the other hand, it’s understandable. The overall impression is that it’s for 
people with severe, obvious disabilities, not someone who just wants to make sure there’s 
enough places to sit. In turn, we need to make sure that we’re incorporating passive 
accessibility things, like obvious seating and better lighting, rather than active accessibility 
things, like lifts or large print guides. Things that are just Treasurer’s HouseERE are going to 
be more helpful than things that people have to ask for – Amy said something similar, that if 
she has to ask for something, she’s unlikely to ask for it.  

573 
 
6. James. 
6.1. First meeting. 
James is a very interesting participant – he is not only someone with a hidden disability 
(fibromyalgia), he also has worked in tourism for decades and indeed, works at one of my 
case study sites. The fact that he understood the balance and tension inherent in 
accessibility in listed buildings made him very understanding of some limitations, but also 
aware that there were definitely areas that they could improve without much difficulty.  
 
He was a surprisingly fast walker, though I’m not sure if that’s natural or simply wanting to 
get to a place to rest as fast as possible. He was very engaging with the room guides – 
probably part of his experience in working in tourism and heritage as an interpreter himself. 
He had no problem sitting when he spotted a chair he could sit in, but he also sought them 
out when he entered a room. 
 
He himself said he’s very much a looker rather than a reader, and I wonder if that’s because 
of preference or some undiagnosed learning disability. It’s also very possible it’s simply 
personal preference. 
6.2. Second meeting. 
I’m so looking forward to working with James again in the future – he will be one of the 
people I shadow at Barley Hall, so I’ll be able to follow up on many different topics and any 
questions I have. He’s been remarkably candid and open about his struggles and his 
opinions, and I’m really interested to see how he uses his experience as an employee in the 
heritage industry.  
7. Jessica. 
7.1. First meeting. 
For Jessica, we decided to do the pre-visit questions and the visit itself on the same day, 
which actually ended up being an amazing decision and I’m going to recommend it to all 
participants going forward. The York visits at least shouldn’t present a problem, but we’ll play 
it by ear with the Leeds participants. It might be difficult for me to get to Leeds in time – but 
we’ll worry about that when we get there. 
 
Another thing that was interesting today was the audio recording for the visit itself. Jessica 
put the recorder in her bag, and listening back to the audio, nothing really was recorded. But 
the house itself was very quiet and hushed, as Jessica herself pointed out, so I’m not sure 
that would have made much of a difference. However, I had a feeling that might be the case 
and took as many notes as I could during the visit itself. But it seems like recording the visit 
itself isn’t really necessary – I just need to make sure that I’m taking copious notes. Even 
during some read aloud moments, I took really detailed notes and can reconstruct what was 
said without a transcript. Also the visit took FAR less time than the pilot study visit, about an 
hour total, so that also helped with exhaustion levels. It was about 4 hours total, which was 
amazing. 
 

574 
 
It’s interesting, contrasting Jessica with Teagan and Kasi. Jessica is quite new in her 
diagnosis and even fought against it for a while, whereas Teagan and Kasi have dealt with it 
their entire lives. Given that all three have dyslexia, it’s really interesting to see how they’ve 
handled it well, and yet they all see themselves in the same light, especially regarding 
disabled vs PwD. All of them see themselves as someone with a disability, even though that 
disability affects the way that they read, which is a very significant act in our culture. I’m 
going to follow up with Teagan and Kasi about their use of colour overlays, as I’m not sure if 
Jessica’ use of one was linked to her dyslexia or her Irlens or both. 
 
I think starting my proper data collection with Jessica has been really helpful too. We’re both 
comfortable with each other, and it’s boosted my confidence even more in this whole 
process. I’ve had to reschedule three different participants now, which is rather 
disheartening, but I know that it will be fine. I have plenty of time to get these visits in, and as 
long as I get my Treasurer’s House visits in before Christmas, I’ll be in very good shape. I 
don’t foresee that as being a problem, either, it’s just a matter of persisting.  
7.2. Second meeting. 
Jessica and I met for our final meeting tonight – I admit, I was a bit tired, having come from a 
very busy day at work, but luckily, the meeting didn’t last too long. It was about half an hour, 
and it was just going over the interview questions anyway. Jessica had somewhat prepared 
her answers, judging by how she presented her answers, but I’m glad that she had. A lot of 
these questions don’t really require a gut reaction, and a more thought out answer is helpful. 
I also noticed that I was giving far less vocal feedback than I had with Teagan and Kasi, 
which will not only help with transcripts but also makes me feel like I wasn’t dominating the 
conversations nearly as much. I very much want to put my participants front and center, and 
not talking over them is a crucial part of this. 
 
Overall, I believe Jessica was an amazing participant, and I’ve gotten a lot of good data from 
her. There’s lots of aspects of design that she highlighted that I hadn’t considered before, 
specifically the placing of photos within text panels. If we want to encourage people to read 
our interpretation boards, we need to make sure they actually CAN read the boards, not 
simply glance at them and then decide they’re too difficult to decipher. 
8. Kasi & Teagan. 
8.1. First meeting. 
Overall, the whole thing took about 1.5 hours. It might have been a little less, as we got off to 
a slightly late start, and we had Annora interruptions every now and then. Each time she 
interrupted, however, it made me realise that I probably don't need to have an exact 
transcript of each part, as her little interruptions won't be relevant. It'll be interesting as I go 
to figure out what is relevant and what isn't, but for the start, I think I'll err on the side of 
caution and add in anything that isn't obviously irrelevant.  
 
There was one comment that I made in a teasing, friendly manner that upon reflection, I 
probably shouldn't have, as in the written form it might come across as mean. Kasi had 
made a teasing comment about Teagan being dramatic in her accessibility needs, and I 
likewise made a teasing comment to Kasi, but as soon as it had left my mouth, I immediately 
felt like I had crossed a line. It took away my professionalism, even though I think of Kasi as 
an adoptive little sister. I don't think I should have said it, even though both of them laughed 

575 
 
it off, and I'm debating whether or not to keep it in the transcript. I think I need to keep it in, 
but emphasis the tone in which is was said. 
 
I did find that Kasi was a little quiet and subdued at the start of the interview, letting Teagan 
lead most of the initial discussions. She did open up as the interview went on, and by the 
end, she was talking even more than Teagan was. I feel like there was a certain amount of 
unease discussing her disability at first, as if she wasn't used to people asking her about 
these things or was uncomfortable discussing them in an open manner, but the more I 
looked to her as an expert, the more she seemed to respond to that.  
 
Also, I thought I knew quite a bit about dyslexia going into this, having done a decent 
amount of research for both this PhD and my masters about accessibility for people with 
dyslexia. However, I was quickly shown that I had only scraped the surface of what living 
with dyslexia was like. It was very interesting to see the interplay between EDS and dyslexia, 
and I want to follow up on that in one of our other interviews. 
 
One thing that really surprised me was the insistence (perhaps not the right word) on how 
useful a map to a site was. Not how to get there, but rather how to get around. Even if it was 
a really basic one, showing where exhibits were and toilets and things like that, it would have 
been really helpful for them in the preplanning stage.  
 
I conducted the interview in Teagan's living room. I sat on the floor, as I am quite 
comfortable in that space, whilst they sat on a chair and the couch. I felt that this positional 
authority helped Kasi especially, though Teagan and I have a very good friendship already 
and so we were very comfortable talking about her disabilities. Also, I know they have a 
habit of not turning on the living room light until it gets nearly dark in that room, and so I 
found it difficult to see as the daylight started fading. I also found myself spacing out a little 
towards the end, but I think this had to do with me being quite thirsty and not having any 
water on hand. For future interviews, I think I'll try to sit at a table with them and make sure 
that I have adequate light before we start as well as bring my own bottle of water. 
 
For the morning routine walk-through, Kasi did physically take me through the stages whilst 
Teagan sat on the chair and explained it to me. It was slightly different, I believe, for Kasi, as 
she is staying in a different location than her home, but it still seemed like everything was 
roughly the same for her routine, just with spatial differences due to being in a different 
house. Teagan had mentioned that she had hurt her knee that day, so I didn't want to 
aggravate the injury any more by making her physically walk me through her routine. Plus, 
her morning routine is very regular, due to being a mother, and most of it revolved around 
getting Annora ready rather than getting herself ready for the day. 
 
It was a bit tricky having two people for this meeting, especially when trying to get them to do 
the Thinking Aloud practice. I couldn't concentrate on both of them at the same time, and I 
didn't want to single one of them out at a time, so I drifted between the two during the 
practice. They did both seem to come to it easily enough, and I only had them practice twice. 
I think with future participants, it will really be helpful when there's only one person so I can 
give them my undivided attention, especially when I have limited rapport with them. 
 
Overall, I think it went really well. I need to practice my transitions a little more, practice my 
"speeches" so that it feels more natural, but I didn't refer to my notes nearly as heavily as I 
thought I would, so I felt like I seemed more professional and more prepared than I 

576 
 
necessarily felt. I'll definitely be practicing my sections before I interview other participants, 
as I want to present myself as someone who is very interested in what my participants have 
to say, but also very prepared and has a certain amount of control over the interaction. I 
worry that if I just let them loose, it will seem like I have no idea what I'm looking for, but I 
also don't want strict control over every interaction. I think the way I have it set up now is 
good, I just need to put a little more practice in my sections to really nail down the tone and 
feel that I'm going for. 
8.2. Second meeting. 
So I definitely need to really think through whether the whole trip is worth it, especially to 
Leeds, as this was a VERY exhausting day. I think part of it was just how busy this month is 
and I'm also trying to pull myself out of anemia and that exhaustion, plus getting ready for 
Tanzania. It's also worth remembering that I only need to go to Leeds 4 times, and the rest 
are in York. But maybe a truncated version, as in not following them all the way back to their 
house. Something to consider, at least. 
 
Overall, the visit was helpful, but I think more as a relationship-building exercise. I don't feel 
that I learned a whole lot from the visit itself, at least not things that I didn't already know. 
This may change as I examine other disabilities, but the café chat and the travelling aspect 
were far more informative than going through the museum itself. 
 
Also, I'm really leaning towards doing my own access audit of the museum before I take 
participants around. I can still follow my worksheet, but it'll be easier to go through that on 
my own rather than juggling it with my observations. A lot of the questions won't change from 
visit to visit, and what does change, I can focus on more. I do want to add in things like the 
light meter and the audio reading, as well as testing out the Claro Pen scan app. I can 
probably also find some app that tells me font style and size, and I can more closely look for 
other access aids.  
 
Writing my initial notes in Discord worked surprisingly well – it gave me time stamps and I 
could send quick little messages. I tried to open the journal app I had but it just wasn't 
working well for me. I really like making a note, hitting enter, and being able to start a new 
line where I can't mess with previous notes. So I might make my own server for privacy 
reasons and use that for my field notes. 
 
I am glad that I brought both my plug and my extra battery, as I really needed it, so I'll need 
to get a better battery for my cell phone before I do my full survey. I haven't listened back to 
the audio yet, but I'm interested to see how my shirt worked with the recorder pocket. I also 
need to talk to Neil about making sure I have the cord that's needed to transfer the files 
straight to my computer. 
 
I think I do have QUITE a lot of data though, lots of insights that I would not have gotten any 
other way, so I definitely think this is a really good way of gathering this type of data. I think 
there is more to tease out of the semi-structured visit – like I'm trying to do too much with it, 
and I need to focus it more or perhaps divide it into separate things, I'm not sure. It felt like it 
had lots of potential but I wasn't quite able to unlock it all. But that's what pilot studies are for, 
and I think this is a really good start to the whole thing. 
 

577 
 
Also I managed to lose my print out that I made for myself with my worksheet…. So again, 
doing the audit will probably be a good idea, and making digital field notes as well. Much 
harder for me to forget my phone somewhere. 
 
I didn’t want them to worry about writing or reading the worksheet I made for them, so I 
verbally went through it with them. Also, we had our food then, which would complicate 
things, and when I had given them the consent forms, they didn’t even read them, just ticked 
all the boxes, so I felt it was better to go through the questions as part of the interview. I think 
I want to combine my outline and the worksheet a bit better so that I didn’t have to jump back 
and forth between the two in my folder. I’ve got PLANS for organising that physically though 
for future participants.  
8.3. Third Meeting. 
This interview, I feel, went much better than our café chat. I felt better prepared for sure, and 
I think that had to do with me relistening to things beforehand. I needed to come up with 
those extra questions, so I didn't have to listen to ALL of the recordings, but listening to bits 
and pieces really did help me come up with some of the new ones. 
 
I was definitely very stressed that day because of personal things, but I was able to put it out 
of my mind during the interview well enough I think. I'll have to listen back to be sure, but I 
doubt they could tell. And frankly, it was nice to put it out of my mind for a little while. 
 
Their suggestions for how to improve the study were VERY helpful too, mentioning small 
tweaks that I hadn't considered and also rationalising things that I had been struggling with, 
especially the aspect of making sure I'm inviting enough for people to say no.  
 
Overall, I really think this study went well. I'm going to relisten to everything this next week 
and just make some notes before I try to transcribe the whole thing, but I've got a lot of 
insights that I didn't have before and I know I have lots of data as well. I'm also more 
convinced than ever that I don't need to take notes while recording, as they seemed to just 
detract from my attention. I also really liked having the meetings over meals – people tend to 
lower their defences over food, though I'm not sure it'd be practical for all meetings and all 
participants. Might be worth thinking about though. 
8.4. Barley Hall follow up. 
It was really good to get Teagan’s view of the changes at Barley Hall. Even though she was not my 
original participant to Barley Hall, she was perfect for a few reasons: she had visited Barley Hall 
before the pandemic, but importantly, she has dyslexia (like Alfie) and a joint disorder (like Amanda) 
and could offer insight into both those aspects. 
Her input on the map especially was helpful. I didn’t realise that having different contrasts on a map 
would be a strain, but now that she had mentioned it, it makes complete sense. Not only does it 
make it more readable to be only dark on light printing, it would also save a small amount of ink on 
each map (which would add up, given how many maps they have printed), and given their eco-drive, 
that would be another easy win. 
One thing I did notice going around this time was that the staircase that leads to the closed off area 
was almost hidden. It wasn’t obvious that it was an area that was closed off, and that helps with 
people feeling like they’re not missing out.

Appendix F – Interview Design 
for Organisation. 
This appendix contains the questions that I asked staff during my ethnographic 
observations and interviews. 
1. General questions. 
These are questions that I asked during all observational interviews with front of 
house staff members.  
• 
What’s your favourite thing about your site? 
• 
What’s something you would change about your site? 
• 
What’s something good about your site in relation to accessibility? 
• 
What’s something you would like to see in relation to accessibility at your site? 
2. Follow-up interviews. 
I conducted several follow-up interviews with management staff. The questions were 
based on my observations, and they are listed here. 
2.1. Ellen and Issy (Treasurer’s House). 
2.1.1. General Questions. 
• 
Can you tell me more about your role and responsibilities? 
• 
What’s your favourite thing about Treasurer’s House? 
• 
Are there any staff members who have asked for disability accommodations? 
Is there a process for handling these requests? Has anyone gone on long 
term sick leave? Are there any mental health programmes? 
2.1.2. Themes from Participants. 
Personal Interpretation Boards. 
These were incredibly popular amongst the participants. This isn’t really a question, 
I just wanted to give this feedback! 
Lighting. 
All participants understood that this was a conservation issue, but there didn’t seem 
to be any attempt at compromise. This was a comment not just amongst the 
participants but also amongst other visitors and the staff. Is there some way to 
mitigate this?  
Seating. 
Literally everyone said there weren’t enough seats – even those who found the 
chairs they could sit in them. 

580 
 
• 
Pop up seats?  
• 
Signs on sittable chairs? 
2.1.3. Notes from Observations. 
Layout. 
The basic layout of the house is slightly confusing. Obviously, this can’t be altered, 
but are there ways of making it clearer? 
Staff. 
By and large, staff interaction was amazing. Everyone had nothing but glowing 
praise about the staff and how helpful and comfortable they were with them.  
• 
What kind of training does the staff receive? 
• 
How is the House specific training handled? 
• 
How can Front of House send suggestions/requests/feedback? 
Active vs. Passive Accessibility. 
• 
Could I get a copy of the style guide?x 
• 
Is accessibility part of early discussions? 
• 
Who is “in charge” of access? Is it managed site by site or is there an area 
leader? 
2.2. Mary (Abbey House). 
• What are the duties of the duty manager for the day? 
• What are the duties of a visitor assistant? 
• Who made the decisions for the changes in terms of COVID measures and 
how were those decisions made (if you're able to answer that)? 
• What kind of training do front of house staff receive? I was especially 
impressed with everyone's dedication to accessibility, and I'm very curious if 
training has anything to do with it! 
• Is there a policy regarding lighting levels that I could read? 
• Are there any plans to keep some of the COVID measures, or will things 
revert back to 'normal' once restrictions have been lifted? 
• There were a couple extra staff members I saw throughout the day. One 
seemed to be some kind of cleaning crew (they were disinfecting things 
whenever I saw them, but they were also very unobtrusive about it) and one 
was some kind of technical/maintenance team member. Could you tell me 
what those roles actually were and what they're duties are? 
• There's currently a cap of 36 people in the museum – has this had any kind of 
impact on admission levels? Ironically, at Barley Hall, having a cap on 
people in the museum seems to have increased admission rates, but that 
may be more an impression (there's more a steady flow of people rather 
than very quiet times and very busy times) than an actual increase. 
2.3. Maggie (Barley Hall). 
• 
Barley Hall findings 
o Layout – Maps 

581 
 
▪ Most were slightly confused and worried that they’d missed 
some sections – even with the new layout, people ask about 
the buttery/pantry 
▪ Participants specifically suggested maps to mitigate 
▪ Showed maps to a dyslexic participant, who really liked them 
except the black on white/white on black switch up 
▪ Slight adjustment to steward’s room, as sharp turns are quite 
hard on hips 
o Lighting 
▪ Inconsistent lighting was difficult 
▪ Of course, buttery and pantry were just too dark – at least no 
reading required 
▪ Lesser chamber table too dark to see the instruments well 
o Thresholds 
▪ Some kind of rope to grab and help go over the threshold? 
o Seating 
▪ Fantastic – people felt welcome to sit anywhere and it really 
helped everyone 
• 
General findings 
o Personal interpretation boards  
▪ Handheld boards meant that they could be moved around – 
especially to an area with better lighting 
▪ More personalized experience – also means you can have 
multiple strands of interpretation instead of just the big boards 
▪ One participant specifically suggested a small board in each 
room explaining what the room would have looked like/been 
used during the period 
o Active vs Passive accessibility 
o Dictation vs dialogue 
o Embedded accessibility 
▪ COVID-19 measures 
2.4. Dr Heather Smith (National Trust). 
• 
Role of duty managers at sites? 
• 
COVID policy? 
• 
Categorisation of properties? 
• 
Impact of COVID on the “for everyone, for ever”?

Appendix G – Ethnographic 
Observations. 
This appendix contains all the field notes and field diaries from my ethnographic 
observations at case study sites. Field notes were written during my interviews and 
observations, noting details and events as they happened. Field diaries were written after 
meetings with participants to allow me a more reflective and reflexive way of thinking about 
my interviews and observations. They are arranged alphabetically by site, then 
chronologically within that group.

1.2. Field Diary. 
Today was hugely successful. I was only there for the morning due to a personal emergency 
that happened over lunchtime, but I was able to speak with almost everyone who was 
working that day. Everyone was really helpful, and it was clear that they all got along well. 
They were on friendly, familial terms with their coworkers but also with their managers – 
Steve referred to his managers by their shortened names, indicating that closeness, but also 
he knew who was supposed to be in that day management-wise. I certainly don’t always 
know that at work, so they clearly communicate very well. 
 
It was REALLY refreshing to see the interaction between front of house staff too. Everyone 
has been so cut off from each other, it was clear that everyone at Abbey House was really 
happy to be together again.  
 
I think the term “visitor assistant” is really telling, and it was something that everyone clearly 
took pride in. I want to see what the other places call each of their positions, as I think that 
has some implication on how engaged the employee is. There may even be some research 
on this already, but “visitor assistant” means something different to “visitor experience host” 
which means something different to “admissions host.” This is definitely something to follow 
up on at the other sites. 
 
I only briefly met Rich, who was the duty manager, but he responded very quickly when he 
was called on the radio. Everyone did, actually, despite how big and sprawling it is. 
I found it REALLY interesting that they said most visitors liked the layout of the museum. 
That’s certainly not the case at Barley or Treasurer’s, and they have equally confusing 
layouts. I didn’t see any maps, but the building has also more of a leisurely stroll atmosphere 
to it than the other sites. More evidence that one size doesn’t fit all. However, the fact that 
they had signs for the one way route also gave the street a much better flow.  
 
I did notice that though the temporary exhibition had changed, the layout was basically the 
same. They still had the same positioning of signs and objects, they had the same 
organization of items. I know that there’s only so many ways to change an area like that, but 
I was really struck by the similarities between the new exhibition and the one that my 
participants visited. 
 
I definitely want a follow up email with Mary to ask her some more technical questions, and 
also to discuss what my participants have said, but I don’t know if that needs to be in person 
or not.  
 
Despite how short my day was, I got a really good feel for the atmosphere that they have at 
Abbey House, and it’s strikingly different from Treasurer’s House. 
 

585 
 
I’m not sure what their particular roles were, but I saw a couple people who looked more like 
technical/maintenance team and they were interacting with the same ease as the visitor 
assistants. One had a cleaning kit and sort of scurried away when visitors approached an 
area, but in an unobtrusive way. It was almost like she wanted to let the other staff shine and 
do their roles. The other was hanging posters in various areas for other LM&G sites and 
exhibitions, and he was quite respectful of the visitors when they were around and stayed 
back while they interacted with other staff members, waiting for a free moment to ask for 
something or to access a particular area.  
 
There really wasn’t a lot of people at the museum today, I think I saw 8 other people during 
the morning, and never in groups of more than 2. It did have a really nice, relaxed 
atmosphere, and I wonder if the cap on numbers would help Lisa feel more at ease. It’s 
almost forced ‘quiet hours’ onto the site for all the time, and I really wonder if that’s good for 
access. I know it’s difficult financially, but I do wonder if visitors appreciate it, or if they’d 
rather have the bustle.  
 
1.3. Meeting with Mary. 
Personal interpretation boards 
• Layout 
◦ Looking at getting a map produced – on the cards for a while 
◦ Led by the access committee 
• Lighting – used to change on the Victorian street 
• Changes post-COVID? 
◦ Kept hand sanitizer, encouraging mask wearing, encouraging 
social distancing 
▪ Reinforced through signage “personal space is lovely, please 
be mindful” 
▪ Very variable in following these 
▪ Staff members wear masks when moving around the museum 
or if public facing 
◦ Sneeze screens are still at the tills 
◦ Signage encouraging to use hand sanitizer 
◦ Staff are taking regular lateral flow tests 
◦ Lifted cap on numbers – tickets available online – trying to avoid 
everyone arriving right at 10 
◦ Able to reopen childhood gallery and community gallery 
◦ Crafts are still bumper craft packs (probs staying that way) 
◦ Starting to think about Christmas 
▪ Book room was Santa’s Grotto – carry on doing that? 
◦ Online engagement has been fantastic – keeping that up 
◦ Still have QR code, still will take details is desired 
◦ All office staff were “taking turns” to go in and were working from 
home where possible – LCC policy – now it’s easing everyone back 
in 
▪ Working from home will continue but in a more hybrid 
capacity – green impact as well

1.4. Mary’s Emails. 
• What are the duties of the duty manager for the day? Basically the duty 
manager is there to make sure things run smoothly. They ensure we have 
enough staff, make sure everyone knows what’s happening that day and at 
what time, that the building is safe to open to the public and be on hand to 
provide any support needed and deal with any issues that arise. If there was 
an emergency they would coordinate whatever actions were necessary. 
They are also there to supervise any contractors on site and ensure the 
security of the building and collections.   
• What kind of training do front of house staff receive? I was especially 
impressed with everyone's dedication to accessibility, and I'm very curious if 
training has anything to do with it! The VA’s training starts with their 
induction which covers familiarisation with the building, collections, different 
staff members and roles, emergency procedures, cleaning, health and 
safety, customer care, cash handling, EPOS training security and daily 
procedures of all kinds. They have training on facilities available for those 
with additional needs such as touch tours on demand, ear defenders, 
torches, magnifiers and wheelchairs available to borrow, braille signage in 
the museum, all signage is large print, that we will adapt workshops and 
tours, BSL interpreters available (with advance notice), info on our monthly 
sensory play sessions and relaxed activities.  The more specialised training 
they receive are things like annual safeguarding training. As one of the few 
council buildings in an urban area we are a designated safe space and 
sometimes have to deal with difficult and sensitive situations. We are just 
trying to organise a refresher of Safe Space training. They have also 
received Makaton and Dementia Friendly training. 
• 
Are there any plans to keep some of the COVID measures, or will 
things revert back to 'normal' once restrictions have been lifted? This 
is something we are working on at the moment as a service. We do foresee 
keeping some of the measures in place whilst others will be relaxed.   
• One accessible suggestion that came from the front of house team was for 
Relaxed Santa. They suggested we turn off the noisy hand dryers in the 
toilets and replace with hand towels for the day to avoid triggers for visitors 
who are noise sensitive. We’ve continued to do this for any event that is 
aimed at visitors with additional needs.

Building and exhibition are popular 
• 
Small children – vastly different experience 
▪ 
Must be on time 
▪ 
Less interactive 
▪ 
Take home wand 
▪ 
Less to DO – leads to shorter visits 
• 
No response to maps 
• 
Simple instructions aren’t simple instructions to a lot of people (i.e. use 
the toilet before you go upstairs) 
• 
Reuse the maps – put them back into circulation after a quarantine 
period, environmentally conscious 
• 
Not as much grumbling over buttery/pantry as expected 
• 
Would like the shop & admissions back together – so little to do when it’s 
separate, it’s very boring now 
• 
Liked seeing the customers come back out – less engagement with 
them now 
• 
Feels more detached from visitors 

588 
 
• 
Weirdly more interaction with fellow staff members – but only kinda 
• 
They really only pass each other a few times during the day, there’s 
not much chance to chat 
• 
Management really receptive to suggestions – if there’s capacity 
• 
Subtitles 
• 
Far stricter on COVID enforcement, making them feel safer 
• 
Overly cautious, if anything 
• 
Screens reflect a lot actually, especially at certain times of day 
• 
Wheelchair access – free admission since they can only access the ground 
level, and even then, from a different entrance 
• 
Portable ramp 
• 
Fave – very unique – more interesting than most people expect 
• 
Really good relationship with management – trust in your responsibility/work 
ethic so you’re not being micromanaged 
Interaction still very personable (same with Paul) 
QUITE a long intro though 
Finn and Paul R both dropped in while I was there 
• 
Chatted with each FOH and asked after them 
• 
Finn on duty, also cleaning 
• 
Paul off rota, still checking in on them 
2.2. Field Diary. 
It was really interesting to get two vastly different perspectives on Barley Hall. Jessica 
primarily works at BH, while Paul was primarily at one of the Walls sites that has since 
closed because of COVID. Despite their disparity in how long they’ve worked there, they still 
had similar views of how things changed, especially with the interactive element of the site. 
That’s something that it has in common with Abbey House, that taking away the interactive 
elements has made it less child-friendly and really changed the experience. I wonder if the 
same will hold true for Treasurer’s House, since that wasn’t nearly as interactive (at least, in 
terms of multi-sensory activities) before COVID. Not to mention the impact on accessibility, 
which was felt by the whole staff. 
 
The interaction between the different groups was exactly what I’ve come to expect from 
YAT. Everyone is very personable with each other, on very good terms, and even if they 
don’t know each other very well, there is an element of comradery amongst everyone. While 
I was there, one of the cleaners came by (he normally works as a Viking interactive at 
JORVIK, but has joined the cleaning team and goes between the three sites, cleaning high 
contact areas throughout the day) and was chatting and laughing with Jessica, even though 
he’d never worked at Barley Hall before and therefore didn’t know her very well. 
 
The same held true when it came to management. Both managers (one on duty, one off 
rota, so he wasn’t in charge of the building) came down multiple times in the span of about 
an hour and checked on the staff members. They asked how they were doing and also how 
the building was doing, a quick way to ask if there was any situation they needed to be 
aware of or deal with. It was quite a small interaction, but it was clear that there was a good 
rapport between the managers and the front of house. 
 
It was really interesting to see Finn especially, as he came down with a bucket of disinfecting 
wipes. He didn’t leave all the cleaning to the front of house staff, he dug in beside them to 
keep the site clean. It was nice to see that the managers aren’t “above” certain types of jobs, 
especially the less glamorous ones.

• 
Wondered if any participants would check out the website to see how accessible it 
really is?

SO many volunteers – FoH don’t always recognise them

Inspire to Engage 
• 
Mystery visits are about membership

Less necessary engagement because of layout (first volunteer is the intro to the 
house)

Garland WAS about access – steward noticed someone struggling to get up and 
adjusted it – no complaints that were known about

Longest stretch was about 5 minutes without a visitor at reception

Similar sitting chairs across properties

Takes a long time to get new things – lamp on desk took a long time (how long?)

see it” according to another volunteer) 
o 
20-25% use the boards 

592

guidelines 
• 
DM – open/close building, “on call” 
• 
Don’t print on stark white paper anymore – light green or yellow 
o 
And yet, the desk stuff is on white paper – concern more for visitors than 
staff? 
Friday 20th December. 
• 
Great Hall Observation (1143-1213) 
o 
Total: 24 
o 
Boards: 2 people 
▪ 
They used 2 of the boards each, stood near the info stand to read 
them, looked around the Hall in response to reading things 
o 
Seat: 0 

593 
 
o 
Layout confusion: 7 (3 came back from King’s Room confused about where to 
go) 
o 
Really engaged with visitors – not many really lingered but those that did 
spent quite a lot of time here 
• 
6-7 people in the Minstrel’s Gallery is completely too many – choke point, and yet 
there’s written interpretation here 
• 
Christine 
o 
3rd year 
o 
Socialise out of hours as a team 
o 
Favourite thing is the story of the House – such a uniqueness to the site, it’s 
about one guy 
o 
Everyone is so welcoming 
o 
Wants more things for children, more exhibitions 
• 
Volunteers are really close and sociable  
o 
Little bit cliquey 
• 
Send an email to Natalie, Anne, and Trish about coming back in April and also about 
scheduling meetings with them during closure 
• 
Better pricing sign in the foyer 
• 
No disabled toilet for men – only in the women’s, separated from the ACTUAL 
women’s toilet but it still makes men uneasy 
• 
Audio guide was Frank Green talking about the house 
• 
Used to have a lift 
• 
David – cluster manager 
Tuesday 13th July 2021 – guided tour 
• 
People gather outside 
• 
Slight confusion over where to stay until your starts 
• 
Guide takes you down to the toilet – waits a decent amount away so no pressure for 
speed 
• 
REALLY weird to see it so empty inside downstairs 
• 
First room is an overview of the history of the site 
• 
Romans up to Frank Green 
• 
Room 2 – mention the sittable chairs in each room 
• 
5 people per group, so six total with tour guide 
• 
Groups do cross each other a bit – in great Hall and bottom of William and Mary stair 
case 
• 
It's a lecture tour now, so less interaction 
• 
Well less spontaneous interaction 
• 
Little bit of chit chat but there's not the extended kind I saw before 
• 
Crossover at the top 9f the stairs too 
• 
VERY similar script from what I've heard of the other tours 
• 
Mild disappointment from the guide about the clocks not working – especially since 2 
are quite important to the tour 
• 
No stopping in the King's room because covid?? 
• 
But the minstrels gallery, which is smaller, is okay 
• 
No stopping in the gallery room too 
• 
Finish up with a slide show at the end – chance for everyone to sit 
• 
Slide is is stuff from the previous three rooms (minstrels, Kings, gallery) that we 
couldn't stop and look at 
• 
So now we can sit and listen to the lecture as we look at the pics 
• 
Good close up pics – might not have been able to see these details on a regular tour 
• 
However there is very little circulation in here, so it's slightly stuffy and I kinda just 
want to fall asleep

3.2. Field Diaries. 
Sunday 8th December. 
• 
Anne and Sarah – very lovely, very helpful 
• 
Not much official disability training – but very eager to help 
o 
Accommodating 
• 
Take notes with phone? Insert photos 
• 
Knew the access off well – especially how people can get around (# of stairs to café) 
o 
How to determine who needs the information? 
• 
A lot of good intentions – super hard to read the PP room guide and no text on the 
room book 
o 
Need to redo both 
• 
No audio guides but still have references to it 
o 
Thorough exam of the site to make sure everything is up to date 
• 
Take photos of toilets to demonstrate equipment 
• 
Really want a pull gauge to measure how heavy the doors are 
o 
Any lit on how heavy is too heavy? 
o 
Volunteers know about the heavy door, but admissions don’t 
o 
Who to talk to about this? 
• 
BDR lighting is very divisive, even amongst the staff 
• 
Advertise discount admissions? 
• 
Totally forgot to introduce the research – really need to do that, probably coloured 
some of the early discussions 
• 
Seemed a lot of people were a bit lost 
• 
What does staff do during closure? 
• 
Disability policy for staff? Anyone on extended sick leave? Mental health programs? 
• 
Genuinely pleasant people 
o 
Bit of a disconnect between FoH and Management 
▪ 
Changes to Father Christmas bookings, seemed to be frustrated by 
the limitation  
• 
Sarah – dyslexia 
• 
Any staff accommodation? 
• 
Doing what they can with what they have 
• 
Frank Green said not to change a thing – how seriously will they take this? 
• 
Definitely a line between admissions and room guides 
o 
Def need to observe room guides 
• 
The access offers are there, but no one’s using them 
o 
Active vs passive 
o 
Advertise? 
o 
List on admissions? 
• 
Hearing loop – always on? 
• 
Traffic light system? 
Monday 16th December. 
• 
Unintentional obliviousness is a huge thing 
• 
Confusing layout – the admissions people say it’s because people don’t listen, but 
that can’t be all of it 
o 
ADHD 
o 
Dyslexia 
o 
Audio processing issues 
o 
Memory 
• 
New touch tour – better printing, much better interpretation 

595 
 
o 
But will it be used? 
• 
They have membership training, why not disability training? 
• 
Need to set up a meeting with Trish and Anne – any longer term disability? Any 
accommodations? Any disabilities on the team? 
• 
Genuinely pleasant people and also eager to help – but super need disability 
awareness training 
o 
Very common comment: staff were brilliant (let’s just make them a little more 
brilliant) 
Tuesday 17th December. 
• 
Conflicting info about training – ask higher up? 
• 
Very compartmentalised 
o 
Admissions and retail 
o 
Café 
o 
Volunteers 
• 
What do the managers do? 
o 
No toilet check sheet 
o 
No hourly walk around 
• 
People don’t sit a lot – same red chairs across the Trust 
o 
Maybe pop up stools? 
• 
Banister WAS about accessibility – no complaints, one of the volunteers saw 
someone struggling and changed/adjusted it 
• 
Some volunteers have been at TH for 30 years – THAT is buy-in 
o 
How do they incentivise this? Why are people staying? 
• 
Alarms around neck – good way to call for help in a sprawling place like this 
• 
FoH is very eager to help – down to engagement training 
• 
SO many volunteers omg – they really engage with the visitors 
• 
Tour guides are only around for the tours- what kind of buy in do they have? 
• 
As always, it takes time to get new things in – apparently, it took forever to get a lamp 
on the desk (for lighting levels?) 
• 
I think the info stands in each room are a missed opportunity – floor plan? Pop up 
stool? Reading lamp? 
• 
Tomorrow will be good for volunteers – but chatting with each over lunch is good 
(one on one chatting is helpful) 
o 
Catch the volunteers on their break? 
• 
Also really need to have a proper, full day with them – but that’s for spring 
• 
Feel very rushed with a lot of this – partly the time of year 
o 
AH – March – take that month off (or go down to fewer days a week) 
o 
BH – April – stretch it out more/use DM shifts? 
o 
TH part 2 – May 
• 
Also, make weekly write up of themes 
Wednesday 18th December. 
• 
The volunteers are SO passionate about the House 
o 
Need to ask them how many years volunteering 
• 
Really want to check their training 
• 
Asking one thing they’d change is a really helpful question – also ask them their 
favourite thing about the House 
• 
Interesting how varied some of the responses are – how often people sit, how often 
they use the boards 
• 
It seems the more comfortable the volunteer is with people, the more aware they are 
of disabilities – is there a link? 

596 
 
o 
Someone mentioned that they link it to their own need to sit/rest, backache, 
whatever 
• 
Paul and BDR person were both really in turn with body language – is that with 
training or experience? 
o 
Helpful with disabled people 
• 
Again, everyone is really lovely but seemingly isolated 
o 
Do they hang out after work? Have parties? 
• 
Need to ask about lighting 
o 
One volunteer mentioned the lighting and WOW does reception get dark – 
meter reading in morning and afternoon 
o 
Need to be more systematic in taking readings 
• 
BARELY saw management 
o 
Super division between them 
• 
Don’t always recognise the volunteers 
• 
Methodology for taking meter readings 
• 
Ben seems quite up on access stuff – but he’s also one of the more enthusiastic and 
personable of the reception staff 
• 
Some kind of chart for the terms? Venn diagram of responsibility 
o 
More like isolated spheres of interaction 
• 
How does management put together House training? 
o 
Specifically “tips and tricks” – what is the communication line? 
• 
iPad roll out? 
• 
If FoH has suggestions/requests, what are the mechanisms? 
• 
Observe from the minstrel’s gallery for 30 mins 
• 
Actually DO the touch tour 
o 
It’s for Visually Impaired visitors…. In text format 
• 
Paul was a great room guide – want to talk more with him 
• 
Need to get the design guidelines 
Friday 20th December. 
• 
Need to chat more with Mike (? bald guy with elf ears) 
o 
Knew a great deal about The that I hadn’t heard yet 
• 
Day leaders are going to be REALLY helpful 
o 
Volunteers with an extra level of passion 
• 
Ben was unsure I knew Avril – reflection of culture of isolation in TH? 
• 
Need to organise my days better (sticking with reception, watching rooms, chatting 
with volunteers, rather than all in one day) 
• 
Overall, it’s proven just how useful this kind of research is – there’s so many behind 
the scenes things that are preventing change 
• 
Can they even trust management to listen? 
• 
Need to be more systematic about my questions too – catch them in the break room? 
• 
Room observations are great too – need to structure those a bit more 
• 
Sarah – dyslexia, but mild – doesn’t need many accommodations 
o 
She has a hard time reading on stark white paper – so why are the sheets on 
the desk stark white? They don’t use white paper for visitor sheets, why 
reception sheets? 
• 
SUCH variation in lighting levels – need to make a map/diagram of the levels? 
3.3. Meeting with Heather. 
• 
Role of duty managers at sites 
o Different way of operating than AH/BH 
o Redoing what it is anyway 
o Rotates betweens head of department 

597 
 
o Don’t do anything unless they’re called 
o Don’t practically need to do anything 
o Heather WOULD, though, just to check in 
o Most of the time, they just cover breaks at most 
o In COVID times, they’ve been responsible for more cleaning tasks and 
floating around 
o If they’re not called, they don’t need to be around – not entirely a bad 
thing 
o But still no toilet checks so 
o More of a Treasurer’s thing than a National Trust thing 
o Rethinking the role – someone wanted a more active role for DMs, much 
more of a service model than waiting to be called 
o Changing the name as well – more of an emphasis on service 
o Proposed way forward – Heather will come back about this  
o Higher visibility and proactivity 
o Not always the head of department doing this, maybe someone else? 
o How much has this change been discussed with Front of House staff? 
Heather to follow up on consultation process 
o Organigram just doesn’t exist for the lower down, property level – follow 
up with Heather 
• 
COVID policy 
o Daily briefing for months that went to all staff; then it became 3 times a 
week; now it’s twice a week 
▪ 
M – Stuff you need to know (what Boris means) 
▪ 
F – Nice to know (fun things that have happened at properties) 
▪ 
Always an intro from an executive 
• 
Weekly video blog from Hilary McGrady 
▪ 
Transcribed nearly from the beginning (missed first 2 weeks) 
▪ 
Added subtitles 
▪ 
Just audio version 
▪ 
Transcribed in Welsh 
▪ 
Sometimes a walk and talk – but people are finding that distracting 
(neurodivergent) 
▪ 
Even on her holidays, she’s had someone else do it so that there’s 
always a video blog each Friday 
• 
Lots of text-based things (the blog has been a good way to diverse) 
• 
Lots of links to Acorn system – policies and procedures 
• 
Webinars throughout last June as they prepared to reopen 
▪ 
Sessions with experts and heads of departments 
▪ 
Regionally as well 
▪ 
Every week for a while, less often now 
▪ 
“How to help you make sense of all the words” 
▪ 
Listening in sessions – general feedback 
▪ 
All recorded, all subtitled 
▪ 
Lots of social media for external consumption 
• 
Even on furlough, you could keep up to date (if you wanted) 
• 
Wellbeing webchats – 2 a week for several weeks, now about once a 
fortnight 
▪ 
People are busy at work now 

598 
 
▪ 
Furloughed staff were a different group than those still working, as 
they were having very different experiences 
• 
On-property briefing as they came back to work 
• 
Mandatory e-learning courses 
▪ 
Re opening safely 
▪ 
Staying safe (many visitors were being awful when we re-opened) 
• 
Continuity group met every morning  
▪ 
Meet every day as a way of keeping things consistent 
▪ 
Changed from “how are we going to deal with all this” to “right, we’re 
doing this, so how are we going to go forward” 
• 
Really DID try to pivot 
▪ 
Set up all these things quickly 
▪ 
Didn’t really repeat things or change the method of delivery 
▪ 
Didn’t do a lot of direct checking in with various teams (left that to 
more of a regional team) 
▪ 
Unsure how successful that was 
• 
Heather checking in who is now in charge of Treasurer’s 
• 
“Implications of all the info coming out of all the other groups” group 
• 
Still needed all these other bits that are normal for every year – like a 
member’s handbook 
• 
New signage that was consistent 
• 
How does access development factor into this 
• 
More regional discussion feeding into this, which would then go 
upwards 
• 
Cascading information didn’t always trickle down to the front of house 
• 
But then, it would be overwhelming for a lot of people 
• 
Daily briefing was great but after several months, it was hard to keep up 
• 
Good for consistency 
• 
But it also felt like if you missed a couple days, you wouldn’t be 
missing much – except that you could miss something crucial 
• 
Seems like the two a week worked best 
• 
Lots more people than usual contributed to these discussions 
• 
Especially volunteers – higher risk of COVID in that age tbh 
• 
Lots of emotional responses – mental health impact? 
• 
Got about 2/3 of volunteers back, but not sure if the last 1/3 back will 
be back 
• 
All staff back 
• 
Basically all houses back open – some are open for fewer days a 
week (TH is 4, I think?) – fewer staff to open the properties 
Categorisation of properties? 
• 
Think about interpretation of how we open 
• 
“Treasure Houses” – larger houses, more significant collection, ex: 
Beningborough House, mostly London and Midlands and Southwest 
(where most of the houses are) – more support than other properties, not 
necessarily more funding, more priorotised 
• 
“Small properties” – only opening infrequently, tour-led, minimal free flow, 
low staff, building is more important than the contents, part of a larger 
portfolio, better utilised by the community or a live-in family, may need a 
different volunteer structure 
• 
~60 properties 

599 
 
• 
Used to be ‘little gems’ but people found that upsetting?? 
• 
TH is here 
▪ 
Important because of its location in York, but not really 
important in and of itself 
▪ 
More liberty in terms of interaction with visitors 
• 
Setting up a new approach to working with disabled audiences 
• 
Especially training 
• 
Dementia, autism, sight/visual awareness, deaf awareness/sign 
language 
• 
Pilot properties to try out this training 
• 
Half are “help us shape this training” and half are “here’s this 
training, tell us what you think and we’ll adjust” 
• 
Training in how to give a tour 
▪ 
Sometimes a separate tour, sometimes just inclusive in the 
general tour 
• 
Touch tours development/training 
• 
Focusing at little gem sites because they might be feeling 
overwhelmed with everything else 
• 
Funding bid for more face to face training (arts council) 
• 
And the build up resources 
• 
How to develop a touch tour 
• 
How to audio describe 
• 
Looking to external consultants and partnerships 
Impact of COVID on the “for everyone, for ever”  
• 
Everyone Welcome program – test programs 
• 
Action based research wasn’t going to be a thing thanks to COVID, 
had to adjust 
• 
Forced to re-evaluate whether that was the right method anyway 
• 
How do we set this up correctly now? That was Heather’s focus in 
adapting this program 
• 
Doing things on test properties wasn’t going to be viable 
• 
Working groups and external consultants/partnerships was the way 
forward 
▪ 
Day to day interactions feed into this via the working groups 
• 
Inclusive Leadership 
• 
Not just ‘leaders’ – everyone is a leader in a way 
• 
How do we incorporate that information? Recruitment? 
▪ 
Declaring identities if they wish to 
▪ 
Confidence in the organisation? 
• 
Preparing staff to interview a variety of candidates (one size does 
not fit all when it comes to interviewing) 
▪ 
Putting enough knowledge in the people/HR department 
▪ 
Sign language example 
• 
Cultural change of the organisation 
• 
New inclusion leader (from corporate and university) 
• 
Leading them through the other objectives 
• 
Access stayed through all these changes 
• 
Heather leading on this with the new inclusion lead 
• 
Picking up some of the stuff from the earlier work 
• 
National and local partnerships (RNIB, for example) 

600 
 
• 
It’s not just about some tick-box programs, it’s trying to changing the 
approach 
▪ 
Not just having a dementia café, it’s about noise levels and 
calming areas and pathways and things like that 
• 
We’re welcoming people with all their experiences, all their talents, 
and that includes staff as well as visitors 
• 
Welcome vs belong is something different 
• 
Training, access audits, access standards (drawn from various 
sources including comments from disabled visitors) 
▪ 
Standards – partner document to other areas’ standards (like 
food and beverage) 
▪ 
Correct distance between tables for wheelchair users, 
dampening fabrics, etc. 
• 
And obviously, lots of crossover between areas and 
documents, but it’s an evolving thing 
• 
Reasonable adjustment process 
▪ 
Goes trhough the people team rather than just Heather 
▪ 
Originally going to launch in October, might be this 
summer 
▪ 
Ways to fund quickly and easily and get people working 
the way that they work best 
▪ 
External partnerships with suppliers 
• 
Separate stuff for outdoors but not super relevant to me 
• 
Working with RCMG (?) around disability heritage 
• 
Heather is getting several millions of pounds to help with the delivery 
of the access standards (bronze level) 
• 
Want them to level up 
• 
Properties then bid to level up even more 
• 
Inclusive histories 
• 
Driven by BLM movement but then stepped back and said “we 
need to be doing this anyway” 
• 
Building back to nearly the pre-pandemic levels of membership, which is 
fantastic 
• 
Lots of people are coming to join for their cause rather than the 
financial benefit 
• 
Really interested in how many disabled people will join once access 
increases 
• 
Neurodiversity is SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST AUTISM 
• 
Playing our Part document is still relevant – grab that from the website 
• 
Two main themes: environmental impact and inclusivity 
• 
Significance of heritage as a whole in the UK 
• 
Lots of stuff coming out about the whole impact of COVID on disability – 
and more likely to come out over the next 2 weeks 
• 
Seems like disabled families especially are shrinking back as 
everything ‘gets back to normal’

Volunteers

Good to have it written down

Not really CHANGING their behaviours, just reinforcing them 
▪ 
They’re already doing just fine, but it’s good to have back up

Trust wide – working on improvement 
▪ 
Catch up chat in the morning

They’re trained to make assumptions about visitors but not judgemental assumptions 
• 
Don’t have to ask for tablets or maps 
• 
Touch trail – they offer it, but they don’t want too many people to touch things 
• 
Can’t have too much on the desk – too cluttered 
• 
Really in depth access guide 
• 
Hearing loops – on reception till and shop till 
• 
Would like to include access to the café that doesn’t involve steps (outside door?) 
• 
Really trying to go with passive in some instances – but still a reliance on verbal 
transmission of info (seating, intro to boards) 
• 
Ask Anne about responsibility of reception vs café vs volunteers 
• 
Interesting dichotomy – moving some of the info (layout, item info) to passive, but still 
relying on active conveyance for other info (seating, intro to the boards) 
• 
Is there a difference in quality during busy vs non-busy days? (they have more time 
to explain things to visitors?)

Hugely beneficial to him and his confidence 
o 
Team leader -> team leader meeting (with David – GM of the area)

Music in the Great Hall – concerts?

Long ramps – need to be long for the gradient, but could there be other 
solutions? 
o 
Classes – tied into the collections (needlepoint, etching, woodwork, etc) – 
practical, experiential

Small lectures on particular items 
o 
Specific person to head access and communication between groups

Appendix H: Disabled 
Participants’ Response. 
In this appendix, I include my disabled participants’ response to how they wish to be 
addressed within the text. First, I include my email to them, then their responses. I 
have listed them alphabetically, and removed one participant’s full name that he 
included in his email.  
1.1. My email to participants. 
Hello again!! 
 
A few weeks ago, I had my PhD viva - I have some corrections to make. 
 
First of all, I want to thank you SO much for your time and insight, I genuinely 
appreciate it and could not have done it without you. 
 
Secondly, one of the corrections that my viva team suggested was to anonymise 
everyone, as they were concerned that participants would change their mind years 
down the road and not want their name associated with this research. To be clear, 
this is not a reflection of the ethics of the project, nor of your participation. From the 
very beginning of this project, I wanted to amplify the voices of people with hidden 
disabilities and acknowledge their agency and personhood, including using the name 
and pronouns that they preferred. 
 
Since I want to continue to defer to your preference, I wanted to know your thoughts 
on the matter. As I see it, there are three options: 
1. 
I leave your name as it appears in the drafted thesis, and work with the 
ethics committee to create a process by which people can remove their 
names later on if they so wish. 
2. 
Change your name in the draft, to appease the viva team, but change it to 
a name you choose, so that you can still easily see your contribution. 

606 
 
3. 
Change everyone's name with names that I choose, again to appease the 
viva team. 
As always, I want to be your advocate, so whatever your decision is, I will respect it 
and even fight for it if I need to. 
 
Let me know which of these options you prefer, and I will act accordingly! 
1.2. Participants’ Responses. 
Alfie: In my opinion you are the one who has done all the hard work, it is entirely up 
to you. You have worked really hard. I am happy with any, but if it is decided to 
change names to something decided by us, I’m happy to go by the name: [redacted] 
(my legal name come August). 
 
Amanda: With regard to my name appearing in the document I'm of the opinion that 
I'm happy for it to remain. I'm not defined by my disabilities but there's no denying 
that I have them! I realise this is an academic document but having names in it gives 
it a more personal perspective in my opinion.  
So I'm with option 1. 
 
Amy: I am more than happy for you to keep my name in and i 100% agree that in 
this case it is important to have names in and not just get rid of the personal aspects 
of the people involved 
 
Ellie: I would prefer option one, where I use my real name and pronouns, if at all 
possible - however if the majority prefer to be anonymised I'm happy to pick an 
alternative name to use instead. Thank you for asking, I appreciate being involved in 
the decision. Looking forward to reading the finished thesis!  
 
Jessica: In regards to your question I really do not have a preference on which of 
the three options you choose, so I am happy to go with whatever the consensus is. 
Should you need it I am happy with option 3 where you can choose the name you 
change it to but I do agree with your hope of wanting to amplify the voices of people 
with hidden disabilities! 

607 
 
 
Kasi: I wish for you to leave me name and pronouns as I gave them to you (I’m 
honestly fine with any pronoun used within your work).   
 
Lisa: I'm happy to be anonymous or named, whatever is easiest for you. 
 
Teagan: Good afternoon, 
 
I appreciate the courtesy of following up with us to see if we have changed our 
minds, however, I do find it quite troubling that the viva team would have an issue 
with the name section process.  You were very clear that we were allowed to choose 
whatever name/alias and pronouns that we wanted. 
 
I wish for you to leave me name and pronouns as I gave them to you.  If you wish, 
you can try and figure out a process in which I could remove my name later on, 
however, I would hope that the removal of my name be by my choice and not by 
other people deciding what is best for me.
