the
importance
of
addressing
fairness
and
bias
in
artificial
intelligence
ai
systems
cannot
be
over-emphasized
mainstream
media
has
been
awashed
with
news
of
incidents
around
stereotypes
and
other
types
of
bias
in
many
of
these
systems
in
recent
years
in
this
survey
we
fill
gap
with
regards
to
the
relatively
minimal
study
of
fairness
and
bias
in
large
multimodal
models
lmms
compared
to
large

providing
50
examples
of
datasets
and
models
related
to
both
types
of

along
with
the
challenges
of
bias
affecting
them
we
discuss
the
less-mentioned
category
of
mitigating
bias
preprocessing
with
particular
attention
on
the
first
part
of

which

the
method
is
less-mentioned
compared
to
the
two
well-known
ones
in
the
literature
intrinsic

extrinsic

methods
we
critically
discuss
the
various
ways
researchers
are
addressing
these
challenges
our
method
involved
two
slightly
different
search
queries
on
two
reputable
search

wos
which
revealed

and

we
provide

to
the
search

and
the

to
all
the

we
believe
this
work
contributes
to
filling
this
gap
and
providing
insight
to
researchers
and
other
stakeholders
on
ways
to
address
the
challenges
of
fairness

in

ai
introduction
fairness
and
bias
are
very
important
topics
that
cut
across
many
domains
in
the
society
the
rapid
advancements
in
the
research
and
applications
of
artificial
intelligence
ai
have
made
them
even
more
compelling
in
recent
times
such
that
many
studies
have
emerged
on
them

one
important
gap
in
the
literature
however
is
that
there
is
relatively
minimal
study
or
survey
on
fairness
and
bias
in
large
multimodal
models
by
multimodal
ai
we
mean
the
datasets
or
ai
models
that
can
take
one
or
more
modalities
as
input
and
or
another
as
output
this
gap
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
there
are
fewer
works
around
the
topic
for
example
query
search
on
google
scholar
returns
33
400
links
compared
to
538
000
links
for
fairness
and
bias
in
large
language
models
where
the
first
query
search
is
equivalent
to
the
boolean
operation
fairness
and
and
and
bias
and
in
and
large
and
multimodal
and
models
this
implies
more
than
16
times
the
result
compared
to
the
former
however
filtering
the
publication
year
range
to
2014
2024
reduces
the
links
to
17
200
and
19
300
respectively
we
intend
to
contribute
in
filling
that
gap
in
this
work
the
two
terms
fairness
and
bias
are
strongly
related
but
fairness
is
concerned
with
equality
and
justice
while
bias
is
concerned
with
systematic
error
which
may
arise
from
human
prejudices
booth
et
al
2021
alkhaled
et
al
2023
for
the
purpose
of
this
survey
fairness
may
be
defined
as
equal
representation
with
regards
to
given
sensitive
attribute
sa
hutchinson
and
mitchell
2019
frankel
and
vendrow
2020
hence
we
may
consider
generative
artifical
intelligence
genai
to
be
fair
if
it
generates
both
male
and
female
samples
with
equal
probabilities
with
regards
to
the

bias
is
non-random
systematic
error
in

resulting
in
difference

compared
to
another

the

booth

we
acknowledge
there
are
other
quantitative
definitions
of
fairness
and
bias
as
noted
by
hutchinson
and
mitchell
2019
and
weidinger
et
al
2022
it
appears
the
emergence
of
big
data
which
july

has
brought
rapid
advancement
in
the

sota
also
brought
along
the
increase
in
poor

such
as
the
increased
criminal

for
black

observed
by

similar
issues
are
observed
across
many
domains
including
healthcare

and
the

of

the

we
conclude
the

in

with
summary
and
possible
future
work
equity
theory
uses
unidimensional
concept
of
fairness
instead
of
multidimensional
according
to
leventhal
1980
it
perceives
justice
solely
on
the
merit
principle
and
the
final
distribution
of
reward
or
punishment
where
reward
is
proportional
to
contribution

implicit
and
explicit
bias
just
as
inanimate
objects
have
no
emotions
or
thoughts
objectification
theory
establishes
view
of
subject
as
primarily
without
human
characteristics
especially
for
women
and
girls
fredrickson
and
roberts
1997
heflick
et
al
2011
andrighetto
et
al
2019
the
theory
identifies
sexual
objectification
bias
which
is
when
the
emotions
or
thoughts
of
person
are
disregarded
and
one
is
treated
as
mere
body
parts
for
sex
fredrickson
and
roberts
1997
wolfe
et
al
2023
there
is
distinction
between
implicit
and
explicit
bias
such
that
given
two
sets
of
terms
that
express
the
bias
axis
gender
or
race
one
set
of
male
gender
terms
could
be
s1
dad
man
and
the
other
set
of
female
terms
be
s2
mum
woman
implicit
bias
is
sufficiently
specified
with
both
lists
however
explicit
bias
requires
two
additional
sets
of
attributes
a1
engineer
doctor
and
a2
caregiver
carer
that
express
the
terms
to
which
the
earlier
gendered
terms
exhibit
association
albeit
to
different
levels
hence
gender
biased
system
could
result
in
male
terms
in
s1
being
strongly
associated
with
attributes
of
career
terms
a1
compared
to
female
terms
s2
which
could
be
strongly
associated
with
attributes
of
home-related
terms

friedrich
et
al
2021
besides
these
two
broad
distinction
of
bias
there
are
many
types
of
bias
depending
on
the
philosophical
or
social
perspectives
that
may
be
taken
hence
discussion
about
every
possible
type
of
fairness
or
bias
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
study
but
we
refer
readers
to
mehrabi
et
al
2021
van
der
wal
et

and

for
some
of
the
many
types
that
may
be
listed
2.2
concepts
of
fairness
and
bias
in
this
section
we
highlight
few
of
the
concepts
around
fairness
and
bias
found
in
the
social
science
literature
2.2
justice
theory
the
theory
is
regarded
as
three-part
framework
of
distributive
interactional
and
procedural
justice
perceptions
greenberg
1990
landers
and
behrend
2023
distributive
justice
when
outcomes
are
expected
to
be
distributed
equally
is
the
overarching
aspect
related
to
ai
fairness
and
bias
according
to
landers
and
behrend
2023
it
is
based
on
equality
rules
need
or
equity
which
are
influenced
by
social
and
cultural
values
2.3
objectification
theory
consequences
of
bias
fredrickson
and
roberts
1997
confirms
that
objectification
victimises
the
subject
and
may
result
in
habitual
body
monitoring
thereby
increasing
mental
health
risks
sexual
dysfunction
eating
disorders
and
depression
this
unhealthy
reality
is
also
confirmed
by
swim
et
al
2001
they
realized
that
sexist
incidents
occur
more
against
women
and
have
negative
emotional
consequences
for
them
some
of
these
incidents
are
traditional
gender
role
stereotypes
degrading
remarks
and
sexual
objectification
which
are
found
in
the
data
used
for
training
ai
models
for
details
about
the
mechanics
of
training
language
models
we
refer
readers
to
radford
et
al
2019
and
hoffmann
et
al
2022
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
the
use
of
these
models
cause
the
same
negative
effects
for
those
affected
hence
fairness
and
bias
are
not
only
ethical
or
moral
issues
but
have
legal
implications

the

radford

was
turning
point
in
the
language
model
landscape
with
its

as
pointed
out
earlier
training
such
large

required

the

unfortunately
the
attendant
problems

gehman

have
followed
successive
versions
this
is
also
the
case
with

expressed

for
the
reasons
that
the

2019
and

as
observed
by

2023
the
first
second
and
third
involve
quantifying
and
mitigating
bias
in
the
training
data
in
the
trained
model
representation
and
in
the
outputs
of
the
downstream
task
of
the
model
respectively
more
work
has
focused
on
the
latter
two
than
the
first
and
gender
bias
than
other
dimensions
ramesh
et
al
2023
for
example
delobelle
et
al
2022
and
welbl
et
al
2021
measured
bias
in
pre-trained
language
models
one
main
reason
why
more
work
has
been
on
the
latter
according
to
sun
et
al
2019
is
that
debiasing
an
existing
model
to
adjust
the
outputs
usually
only
requires
patching
the
model
instead
of
retraining
with
modified
debiased
or
new
data
which
is
usually
costly
preuse
this
may
be
considered
the
first
step
of
the
nlp
preprocessing
method
for
debiasing
it
involves
quantifying
the
amount
of
bias
or
toxicity
in
given
dataset
by
using
model
after
the
model
has
been
trained
on
different
dedicated
dataset
without
necessarily
attempting
to
mitigate
the
bias
in
the
given
dataset
it
can
be
defined
by
equation
where
is
bias
metric
that
takes
data
as
input
and
returns
scalar
as
the
score
examples
of
works
involving
this

hatebert

equation
is
similar
to
that
in

et
al
2019
of
differential
bias
where
they
approximate
the
effect
of
removing
small
parts
of
training
data
on

gender
bias
is
one
example
of
the
kind
of
bias
that
can
be
estimated
as
it
has
been
observed
that
there
are
more
male
than
female
terms
in
many

the
ability

the

test
weat
which

based
on
the

it
showed
implicit

furthermore
it
showed
the
association
of
male

another
embedding
evaluation
method
is
cosine

it

5.2
debiasing
strategies
although
there
no
silver
bullet
to
solving
the
challenges
of
fairness
and
bias
in
the
data
and
models
of
multimodal
ai
we
believe
combination
of
two
or
more
of
the
following
strategies
on
the
relevant
datasets
or
models
in
tables
and
will
go
long
way
in
mitigating
bias
in
ai
generally
5.2
curate
over
crawl
one
important
method
to
address
bias
in
datasets
will
be
to
curate
rather
than
crawl
this
is
especially
so
because
web
crawling
has
been
the
popular
approach
to
getting
internet
data
in
the
shortest
possible
time
birhane
et
al
2021
the
assumption
of
scale
beats
noise
is
the
rationale
for
this
approach
by
some
researchers
jia
et
al
2021
unfortunately
this
misconception
about
scaling
does
not
only
scale
the
quality
part
of
the
dataset
but
the
noise
along
with
it
no
matter
how
small
as
shown
by
birhane
et
al
2024b
when
they
observed
12
increase
in
hate
content
due
to
scaling
on
the
other
hand
clearly
despite
the
advantage
of
curation
one
hurdle
to
overcome
with
the
curate
over
crawl
approach
will
be
the
issue
of
scaling
in
addition
for
better
quality
data
collection
researchers
like
jo
and
gebru
2020
advocate
that
ai
practitioners
should
build
on
the
practices
of
those
in
the
field
of
archives
and
libraries
and
have
public
mission
statement
to
guide
their
data
collection
practice
weinberg
2022
furthermore
gebru
et
al
2021
encourage
through
datasheets
for
datasets
standardized
processes
for
documenting
important
aspects
of
the
dataset
creation
including
motivation
composition
funding
collection
and
use
cases
with
the
potential
to
mitigate
unwanted
biases
though
this
approach
has
its
limitations
because
individuals
included
or
affected
by
the
datasets
are
not
necessarily
empowered
to
influence
them
weinberg
2022
5.2
counterfactual
data
augmentation
cda
zhao
et
al
2018a
used
cda
to
show
that
it
removes
bias
with
minimal
performance
degradation
on
coreference
benchmarks
when
combined
with
existing
word-embedding
debiasing
methods
it
involves
generating
alternate
examples
of
what
exists
counterfactual
of
data
points
to
counter
or
mitigate
bias
this
method
has
gained
attention
in
the
field
meade
et
al
2022
barikeri
et
al
2021
it
is
sometimes
called
gender-swapping
in
the
specific
case
of
gender
bias
sun
et
al
2019
cda
has
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
tackling
bias
in
coreference
resolution
as
mentioned
earlier
as
it
reduced
the
difference
in
f1
scores
between
pro-stereotypical
and
antistereotypical
evaluations
sun
et
al
2019
dev
and
phillips
2019
also
embraced
this
neutralizing
approach
in
their
work
by
flipping
gendered
terms
with
their
counterparts
for
example
sentence
like
he
was
doctor
would
be
flipped
to
she
was
doctor
despite
the
advantages
as
pointed
out
earlier
about
the
less-discussed
preprocessing
bias
mitigation
method
completely
debiasing
textual
data
can
be
complicated
and
intricate
some
of
the
challenges
are
that
the
size
of
the
data
increases
significantly
thereby
increasing
model
training
time
and
naive
term-swapping
can
create
more
challenges
of
unrealistic
or
nonsensical
samples
in
the
data
she
has
hot
flashes
because
of
menopause
to
he
has
hot
flashes
because
of
menopause

et

5.2
improved
filtering
it
has
been
shown
that
poor
filtering
during
the
data
creation
process
allows
low
quality
data
in
the
final
dataset
birhane
et
al
2024a
it
may
not
be
possible
to
automatically
filter
large
data
to
be
100
fit
for
purpose
but
improving
the
existing
methods
of
filtering
will
go
long
way
in
mitigating
bias
5.2
linear
projection
this
method
projects
all
words
orthogonally
to
the
bias
vector
ensuring
the
updated
set
has
no
component
along
the
bias
vector
vb
as
given
in
equation
bolukbasi
et
al
2016
dev
and
phillips
2019
πb
vb
vb
the
span
that
results
becomes
less
by
in
the
total
dimensions
say
from
300
to
299
which
will
have
negligible
effects
on
the
generalizability
of
the
embeddings
as
an
example
with
gender
bias
subtraction
with
linear
projection
of
gender
terms
from
embeddings
will
make
them
close
gendered
word-pairs
that
have
few
word
sense
he
she
and
him
her
can
have
close
enough
identifcal
positions
in
the

space
after
debiasing
5.2
debiasing
word
embeddings
removing
gender
bias
from
word
embeddings
can
take
one
of
two
approaches
removing
gender
subspace
bolukbasi
et
al
2016
and
learning
gender-neutral
embeddings
zhao
et
al
2018b
the
two
approaches
may
not
be
adequate
for
embeddings
that
are
not
based
on
euclidean
space
since
cosine
similarity
will
no
longer
apply
sun
et
al
2019
the
first
approach
modifies
an
embedding
based
on
the
combined
properties
of
word
embeddings
that
gender
bias
can
be
captured
by
direction
and
neutral
words
are
linearly
separable
from
gendered
words
bolukbasi
et
al
2016
while
the
second
approach
preserves
gender
information
in
some
dimensions
but
compels
other
dimensions
of
the
word
embedding
to
be
free
of
such

5.2
adapters
post-processing
method
for
bias
mitigation
that
is
based
on
adapter
modules
houlsby
et

2019
called
debiasing
with
adapter
modules
dam
was
introduced
by
kumar
et

2023
they
encapsulate
different
bias
mitigation
functionalities
and
can
be
integrated
when
desired
in
model
similarly
to
how
adapterfusion
pfeiffer
et
al
2021
is
carried
out
in
multi-task
learning
dam
trains
the
main
adapter
and
the
bias
mititgation
adapters
independently
before
combining
them
dam
follows
an
earlier
adapter-based
debiasing
method
called
adapter-based
debiasing
of
language
models
adele
performed
in
the
work
by
lauscher
et
al
2021
their
approach
involved
the
additional
use
of
cda
5.2
additive
residuals
to
address
the
skewed
distribution
of
different
identity
groups
in
the
training
data
used
in
lmms
seth
et
al
2023
introduced
debiasing
with
additive
residuals
dear
to
learn
additive
residual
image
representations
this
minimizes
the
representations
capacity
to
distinguish
among
different
identity
groups
thereby
offering
fairer
output
5.2
continued
pretraining
fatemi
et
al
2023
built
on
the
continued
pretraining
concept
which
is
sometimes
used
for
gender
bias
mitigation
with
small
gender-neutral
dataset
de
vassimon
manela

2021
by
introducing
gender
equality
prompt
geep
such
that
it
reduces
catastrophic
forgetting
which
is
likely
event
in
continued
pretraining
kirkpatrick
et
al
2017
geep
achieves
this
by
freezing
the
entire
model
before
updating
the
embeddings
furthermore
cabello
et
al
2023
showed
that
continued
pretraining
on
gender-neutral
data
improves
fairness
by
reducing
group
disparities
in
some

conclusion
fairness
and
bias
are
very
important
considerations
in
multimodal
ai
in
this
work
we
presented
the
challenges
of
fairness
and
bias
in
multimodal
data
lmms
and
llms
defining
what
both
terms
mean
within
the
scope
of
this
survey
while
acknowledging
other
definitions
in
the
literature
we
discussed
the
concepts
of
fairness
and
bias
from
the
perspective
of
the
social
science
and
showed
the
distribution
of
scientific
publications
across
many
publishers
which
reveals
the
gap
in
the
study
of
large
multimodal
ai
compared
to
llms
which
this
work
contributes
to
filling
our
discussions
around
the
methods
to
measure
fairness
and
bias
datasets
for
evaluation
and
debiasing
strategies
will
provide
researchers
and
other
stakeholders
with
insight
on
how
to
approach
these
issues
for
future
work
it
will
be
worthwhile
to
reevaluate
the
progress
made
with
the
metrics
and
tools
for
quantifying
and
mitigating
the
challenges
of
fairness
and
bias
because
despite
the
positive
effects
of
debiasing
in
ai
researchers
like
west
et
al
2019
argue
that
such
research
ought
to
do
more
than
technical
debiasing
and
include
the
social
analysis
of
the
use
of
such
ai
as
this
will
account
more
for
the
impact
of
bias
overall
weinberg
2022
even
sami
et
al
2023
showed
with
the
example
of
dalle-2
that
current
efforts
still
have
their
limitations
in
their
work
on
the
lmm
dalle-2
they
revealed
that
despite
the
guardrails
for
the
model
by
openai
it
generated
40
more
images
of
women
for
stereotypical
female-dominant
administrative
