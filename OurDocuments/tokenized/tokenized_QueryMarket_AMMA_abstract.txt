double
auction
the
web
of
data
wod
is
to
computers
what
the
traditional
web
is
to
humans
the
goal
is
to
expose
data
in
semantic
format
such
that
machines
can
easily
find
the
information
they
are
looking
for
if
implemented
properly
semantic
search
would
lead
to
the
desired
results
much
faster
than
using
traditional
search
engine
however
big
practical
challenge
is
the
adoption
of
wod
technologies
antoniou
and
van
harmelen
2004
in
particular
the
majority
of
data
is
not
available
in
suitable
wod
format
the
primary
reason
for
this
is
lack
of
incentives
for
data
providers
the
wod
is
usually
queried
via
algorithms
rather
than
browsed
by
people
and
thus
advertising
the
main
source
of
income
for
search
engines
on
the
traditional
web
does
not
work
it
is
of
course
possible
to
directly
charge
users
to
search
through
high-quality
data
for
example
bloomberg
lexisnexis
and
thomson
reuters
charge
customers
high
fees
for
accessing
their
data
however
none
of
these
companies
provide
the
means
to
join
multiple
data
sets
thereby
forgoing
the
complementarities
the
wod
would
enable
to
address
this
shortcoming
we
suggest
using
market
which
allows
buyers
to
benefit
from
complementary
data
sources
while
providing
incentives
to
sellers
to
adopt
wod
technologies
concretely
we
propose
to
use
double
auction
designed
to
provide
market
participants
with
good
incentives
to
reveal
their
values
and
costs
such
that
we
can
make
approximately
efficient
allocations
interestingly
in
our
domain
it
is
non-trivial
to
find
payment
rule
that
satisfies
the
participation
constraint
all
participants
have
non-negative
utility
and
the
budget-balance
constraint
payments
made
by
the
buyers
are
equal
to
the
payments
received
by
the
sellers
working
paper
available
at
www.ifi.uzh.ch/ce/files/qm.pdf
the
main
complicating
feature
of
our
domain
is
that
the
sellers
are
selling
their
data
instead
of
just
computational
resources
while
the
sellers
can
provide
some
statistics
about
their
data
it
is
impossible
to
know
priori
what
data
is
available
to
answer
specific
query
because
this
would
require
running
the
whole
query
and
incurring
the
full
costs
thus
there
is
uncertainty
about
which
goods
exist
in
the
market
and
this
may
sometimes
lead
to
inefficient
allocations
if
not
handled
properly
these
inefficient
allocations
can
make
the
payment
rule
infeasible
because
the
participation
constraint
and
the
budget
balance
constraint
may
be
violated
for
example
the
threshold
rule
parkes
et
al
2001
classic
double
auction
which
always
satisfies
participation
and
budget-balance
in
domain
without
uncertainty
is
not
guaranteed
to
work
in
our
domain
our
contributions
we
propose
the
query
market
double
auction
mechanism
for
querying
the
wod
we
show
that
the
threshold
rule
does
not
work
in
our
domain
due
to
the
uncertainty
about
the
sellers
data
we
introduce
three
payment
correction
rules
to
design
payment
rules
that
always
satisfy
the
participation
constraint
despite
the
uncertainty
in
our
domain
we
evaluate
the
efficiency
of
the
three
payment
rules
via
computational
bayes-nash
equilibrium
analysis
lubin
et
al
2015
for
multiple
market
scenarios
we
compare
the
performance
of
our
new
payment
rules
in
domain
with
uncertainty
to
the
performance
of
the
threshold
rule
in
domain
without
uncertainty
we
find
that
our
rules
provide
similar
incentives
and
achieve
similar
efficiency
as
threshold
despite
the
additional
challenge
of
having
to
deal
with
the
uncertainty
about
the
sellers
data
furthermore
we
show
that
even
our
rules
cannot
guarantee
budget
balance
due
to
the
occasional
inefficient
allocations
but
we
demonstrate
that
the
average
amount
of
deficit
is
small
