Abstract
In this paper, common trends of architectural design, technologies, properties, and drawbacks of
indoor positioning systems based on communications supported by smartphones are analyzed. The
main idea of such kind of systems is that their users can use them through their mobile devices
because such systems include positioning functionality based on such technologies as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, and GSM. For example, museums might not need to buy expensive audioguides, but
instead can provide their visitors with appropriate software for their smartphones. The paper
presents a comparative analysis of most promising at the moment systems and solutions.
Index Terms: Indoor positioning system, Fingerprinting, Triangulation, Wi-Fi, GSM, Bluetooth.
I. INTRODUCTION
Creating systems and solutions for solving the problem of indoor positioning and
navigation is a promising and complex task. This problem requires of creating maps based
on floor plans of indoors, choosing the effective positioning technology and algorithms,
deploying the appropriate positioning devices inside buildings. Modern systems can offer
much more than just positioning with acceptable accuracy. For example, the tasks of
navigation, providing context information in text-, audio- or video- format, collection
statistical information about the movements of people in buildings. The functions of these
systems are depending on location type. Thus, the developing companies have great
potential for creating various services.
II. INDOOR POSITIONING SYSTEMS
Dutch company IWAY [1] creates mobile navigation system with special modules
separately for different types of objects and buildings according their destination:
supermarkets, offices, museums, airports, etc. Such applications are focused on
positioning and solutions specific for each object. Customer can download and install the
application from the Internet. For example, the shopping center customers can find a map
of interests to obtain information about discounts and special offers. In addition, there is
an opportunity for the administration to process the data for the analysis of visitors’
movements’ trough the shopping center. The system provides a set of functions to
evaluate the efficiency of the shop work. Using such system makes it possible to
coordinate the work of the shopping center. The system developed by this company
includes mobile and desktop modules for public facilities, staff and administration.
Desktop part of the system is responsible for the analysis, statistical data processing, and

HR management. The positioning method used in the system is based on fingerprinting
technology and uses Wi-Fi signals, 3G/4G. This method provides the accuracy of 1-5
meters. Calculated coordinates can be displayed on Google Maps. However, there is no
information available whether the system uses its own maps or not. Furthermore, the
system is able to determine the user's altitude.
The Wifarer's [2] indoor positioning system has the similar concept as the IWAY's
solution. This system offers a set of maps for positioning indoors, which can provide
various content (for example, descriptions of exhibits in museums). In addition, Wifarer
also provides some statistics regarding the movement of people. The system uses Wi-Fi
fingerprinting technique with an accuracy of about 1.3 m. The system is designed for iOS
and Android, and provides for indoor navigation. Wifarer use individual maps and
Wifarer has developed software that will disrupt the Wi-Fi fingerprints that other
mapping companies use to determine location, making accurate coordinate readings
impossible.
Applications, which use API (Application Programming Interface) of Walkbase [3], have
a different core approach in compare with another systems described above. For
example, an application “Checked” for Android devices doesn’t display client
coordinates on the map, but determines if a user is located in a particular location or not
with accuracy about 3-5 meters. The application allows adding different content with
reference to a particular location which will be displayed on the mobile device screen
when a user will be in the location. The approach is used A-GPS approach, which
requires at least 10 measurements per location. It is also possible to determine the use
location floor. The application uses a machine learning algorithm for adaptation of
changing Wi-Fi hotspots signal (their movement). Applications users can add new
locations and their descriptions in a common Walkbase database. The Walkbase API can
be used by Android OS versions 2.1 and above.
In scope of European project Smartmuseum [4] a recommendation system for visitors
of museums has been implemented. This system supports indoor and outdoor excursions
with positioning. System provides information on the various kinds of cultural places and
other objects. The main features of the architecture of this system are the mechanisms of
content creation that can be interest for a user. The mechanism is based on user’s search
requests in the scope of the system and information of user’s profile. Profile is created
when a user registers into the system and provides information about his/her interests.
Moreover, the system can provide advice to the user and information about places of
interest based on user's location defined using GPS if the user location is open area. If the
user location is inside the building RFID technology is used for positioning. Each RFID
tag stores the URL of the web page with information about the subject of the cultural
heritage. The architecture of this system consists of user profiles server, annotation server
that contains information about cultural values and issue recommendations server, which
processes the user profiles information and their requests. Custom application developed
for Windows Mobile 5 and 6 versions, Symbian versions 9.3 and 9.4.
Google Maps [5] application can solve the problems of positioning navigation in open
areas and in the indoors. It provides possibility to calculate the route inside the building
between several floors, navigate, view photos, and panoramas at 360 degrees. There is
also the ability to view a notification about nearby locations and accompanying content.
For orientation it is used Wi-Fi and cellular networks with the positioning accuracy

ranges from 5 to 10 meters. Outdoor is used GPS and cellular networks. Google Maps
application supports the following popular platforms as iOS, Android, Blackberry,
Windows Phone 7, and etc. Google is releasing a self-serve tool for venue owners to
upload their floor plans to Google for inclusion in Google Maps.
One of the main competitors of Google is a company Skyhook Wireless [6], which
offers SDK to build positioning services (Skyhook Location SDK) and their own
positioning system (Skyhook Location Performance, SpotRank). The company works
with MapQuest using their maps. To determine user location hybrid algorithms that
process signals from the Wi-Fi network, mobile networks and GPS is used. This solution
achieves an accuracy of 10 meters. The using of different sources of signals allows
provide for the user quick positioning with corresponding accuracy. From a complete
cold start, Skyhook determines a user location in 4 seconds. In addition, the system can
provide navigation for the user. Skyhook uses a massive network of more than 700
million known Wi-Fi access points and cellular towers. An interesting solution is the
application SpotRank that keeps track of the density of people in different buildings, for
example, which can provide information on the busiest sites in the area.
The platform developed by Qubulus [7] specializes in solving problems of navigation
in indoor and outdoor and uses fingerprinting technology. Recording Tool allows to the
users recording network data (Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G) in a particular location and adds it to the
total base. These results are compressed into the special FPD file. Further, this
information is used for positioning in the format of Geo-coordinates and displays on
Google Maps or Bing maps. The company provides the ability for customers to write
applications with the cloud API to gather intelligence necessary for effective business
and advertising.
Nokia Research Center has developed Indoor Navigator [8] to provide precise indoor
location information on a mobile device without needing GPS. This indoor positioning
technique based on Nokia high accuracy indoor positioning technology (HAIP). This
technique uses Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi triangulation method and requires to mounting
Bluetooth beacons in the each location. The system architecture consists of positioning
server, global location database and positioning beacons in a number of locations. The
beacons are working in receive and broadcast mode. This approach provides the 0,3 m
accuracy. But the system is not released, and Nokia Research Center did not published
new reports about this project.
Place Lab [9] project’s aim is to determine user location indoor and outdoor.
Technically, the system is based on radio beacons, which periodically sent radio signals
by Wireless LAN access points, fixed Bluetooth stations, and GSM towers. Accuracy of
the presented approach is 13-30 meters.
The Horus [10] is a WLAN Location Determination system, characterized by high
accuracy: through a probabilistic location determination technique and low
computational requirements: through the use of clustering techniques.
RADAR [11] is a radio-frequency based system for locating and tracking users inside
buildings. RADAR is based on empirical signal strength measurements as well as a
simple yet effective signal propagation model. Accuracy of the RADAR is 2-3 meters.
In [12], an indoor localization application leveraging the sensing capabilities of the
current state of the art smart phones is presented. Application is implemented for the
using on smart phones and it integrates offline and online phases of fingerprinting.
Accuracy of presented approach is up to 1.5 meters.

There are several systems and services which solve the problem of indoor positioning are
considered (see Table I, where IPS – Indoor Positioning System). Some considered
systems provides API for developers. There are two types of algorithms for indoor
positioning: signal propagation model and information about the geometry of the
building and location fingerprinting. Fingerprinting approach which is more sophisticated
and promises better adaptability those systems that need an extra infrastructure. The
accuracy of positioning system which uses fingerprinting technique is higher. The
maximum accuracy is 1 m and is provided by Qubulus solutions. Some systems provide
context information to the user depending on location (e.g. it can be exhibition
description in the museum). Some systems provides navigation indoor functionality to
the user, other systems provide only location in the map. Most systems have opportunity
to define the floor of user location. Some systems allow collecting the statistical
information about users' movement, density and personal information. This feature can
be used by organizations to personalized provided services. There are following main
platforms by considered indoor positioning system developers: iOS, Android,
Blackberry, Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Windows Phone 7, Symbian. The most popular
platform is Android. Some systems use external maps (Google maps, Bing Maps, Navteq
Maps, and other), but some systems has own maps and provides possibilities for the user
create own maps.
III. CONCLUSION
Based on results of this study it can be concluded that the main modern indoor
positioning systems has been studied. The companies successfully implement their
platforms, mobile applications and API for creation positioning systems. The most
popular indoor positioning technology is the Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The accuracy of
positioning system which uses this technique is higher than the system which uses other
techniques. The maximum accuracy is 1 m and is provided by Qubulus solutions. There
are several systems which support of members of contextual information. For example,
the information about discounts and special offers for shopping center customers or the
information about museum pieces. The most considered systems has "client-server"
architecture which allows to make some calculations in server side and use maps
provided by several services.
