ABSTRACT
Although the growing concern to make museums accessible to
individuals with visual impairments, their participation in these
institutions is still limited, given the multiple barriers they often
experience and the lack of assistive technologies to promote access.
This research investigates the perspectives of 72 blind and partially
sighted individuals on enhancing their visiting experience in mu-
seums. A co-created framework to improve visitors’ autonomy is
proposed, concluding that sensory, intellectual and physical access
must be integrated into the pre, on-site and post phases of visiting
museums.

INTRODUCTION
Billions of people worldwide live with different types of disabilities
[26], and museums are, more than ever, aware of the importance
of including these individuals and welcoming them in its spaces,
exhibitions and programs. Proof of these institutions’ actual com-
mitment as agents of change is the International Museum Day
theme for 2020 – Museums for Equality: Diversity and Inclusion –
which highlighted their potential in providing meaningful expe-
riences for all [15]. However, a recent report from the European

Union [19] stressed the inaccessibility of cultural premises, venues,
and content as barriers to the blind and partially sighted citizens’
participation in culture.
The World Health Organization estimates that 2.2 billion people
globally have a vision impairment, of whom about 36 million are
blind, 217 million have moderate to severe vision impairment, 188.5
live with mild visual impairment, and 1.8 billion have near vision
impairments [25]. In Portugal, where the present research took
place, data from the last Census allowed estimate that among the
17.8% of the population that declared to have any difficulty, 23%
(900 thousand) specified the vision as a cause, of which 3.1% (28
thousand) reported blindness [16].
Regarding their attendance to museums, only 5.5% of visually
impaired (VI) people visit museums in Europe [8], which exposes
a significant potential market for these institutions [18]. Several
authors [4, 9, 13] relate barriers to their participation with the
fact that museums remain mostly ocular centric oriented, which
does not contribute to the engagement with exhibitions through
other senses than vision, deprives their access to information and
exhibits, and also hinders their independent mobility in the mu-
seum space. Despite VI visitors being one of the most difficult to
address in museums [20], technology can contribute to a beneficial
impact on helping serve these publics by diminishing the barri-
ers to accessibility [12, 24], although being rarely used. Moreover,
positive economic effects are expected with the implementation
of inclusive digital technologies to promote access to exhibitions
[2], since they offer new possibilities to interact with museums and
their themes, which can also bring non-disabled visitors closer to
museum collections, broadening their sensory experiences [10].
While these facts evidence the need for research in this field, few
studies analyze the VI visitors’ needs and expectations across the
continuum of visits to museums to promote great museum experi-
ences from their viewpoints, and how technology can assist them
during the whole museum experience. The present article aims to
extend research in the field of accessibility in museums by exploring
the perspectives of 72 VI individuals to co-create a framework that
could be used to enhance their future visits to museums. The article
begins with the discussion of assistive technologies to enhance
VI experiences in museums. It proceeds with the presentation of
the research methods, followed by the results and the proposal of
guidelines for an integrative and multisensory framework linking
the various museum visit phases with the access required in each
of them. The article ends with some conclusions and implications
for the field.

ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND VISUALLY
IMPAIRED VISITORS’ EXPERIENCES IN
MUSEUMS
VI people’s positive museum experiences depend on their reliance
on other senses besides vision to access information, physical space,
and other facilities [3, 9].
Haptic interfaces allow VI visitors to explore three-dimensional
virtual copies of museum collections, like the Geomagic Touch Sys-
tem [7], in which visitors are required to pick up a pen of the device
to explore the multiple layers of the surface of the artifacts from
the National Museum of Transylvanian History of Cluj-Napoca.
The Probos Sensory Console [2], developed in collaboration with
the Manchester Museum, UK, and Gallery Belvedere, in Vienna,
Austria, allows visitors to explore virtual objects and hear sounds
related to the material properties of the exhibits.
Other museums are using 3D technologies to provide touch repli-
cas digitally augmented, offering tactile and audio multisensory
experiences. Tooteko [23] was developed for the Correr Museum,
in Venice, Italy, requiring visitors to wear a ring sensor during
the tactile exploration of the models, which detects and reads Near
Field Communication (NFC) tags inserted inside the objects, while a
smart device plays the related audio. The Egyptian Cat Sarcophagus
[22] was produced by scanning an original mummy of the Manch-
ester Museum collection, and includes touch-sensitive sensors to
detect the touched areas and trigger contextual audio-explanations,
heard through headphones. The gesture-based interactive audio
guide for relief interpretation of Gustav Klimt’s painting The Kiss
[21] allows exploration by regions, and different audio files describe
the painting and its history. The visitor’s interactions are detected
by a depth camera placed above the replica and connected to a
computer running the software. A similar project allows the explo-
ration of a relief of the painting Madonna with Child and Angels
[6], in which a Microsoft Kinect is used to track the visitors’ hand
movement in real-time, while software determines the correspond-
ing verbal description of each area being touched, which can be
heard through headphones.
Other projects also use technology to provide better physical
access, indoor navigation and wayfinding in museums. Blind Muse-
umTourer [17] was designed for the Tactual Museum of the Light-
house for the Blind of Greece, the National Archeological Museum
and the Acropolis Museum. The application runs on an Android
smartphone and presents vocal routes, emergency, and back op-
tions, and also describes the exhibits approached by the visitor
along the tour route. It uses Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons as
proximity sensors at the exhibits to update users’ current location
and provide audio presentations. Another project [14] proposes a
voice guidance system for VI visitors that uses a hyper-directional
speaker to radiate guiding audio instructions only to a target visi-
tor who needs guidance, and a Kinect image sensor to detect user
position.
Different from the explored solutions, a research project [1] at
the Museum of Cycladic Art, Athens, Greece, allows VI visitors
using a smartphone with a mobile app to choose thematic areas and
exhibits, providing navigation instructions by taking advantage of
sensors embedded in the room. When arriving in front of an exhibit,
the user can tactually explore its form while listening to the piece’s
audio description.
Most of the research found in literature explores technology to
enhance the on-site visiting experience, supporting mainly sensory
and intellectual access to exhibits, and physical access, in some
cases. Extensive research is still needed to identify the blind and
partially sighted visitors’ expectations and necessities across the
continuum of visits to museums, which extends beyond the in-
museum experience [11]. It is also essential to grant a central role
to these people and include their perspectives during the research
process [9, 24], to ensure more fruitful results for all [3]. The un-
derstanding of those dimensions can contribute to help museums
develop unified inclusive solutions, which effectively enhance ac-
cessible exhibition designs and improve the museum experience of
VI patrons.

RESEARCH METHODS
The present research was circumscribed to three of the five regions
of continental Portugal: North, Center, and Lisbon and Vale do Tejo.
It was undertaken for seven months in six cities: Porto, Braga, Viana
do Castelo, Vila Real, Viseu and Lisbon. For the data gathering, it
followed a methodology based on qualitative research.
3.1
Sampling technique
To randomly sample participants for the study, the leading official
institutions for the VI of the mentioned regions of Portugal were
identified. A total of 19 institutions were contacted and asked for
collaboration with this research. The institutions then notified the
members about the research, and 72 people, from 10 institutions,
expressed their interest in voluntarily collaborating in the study.
3.2
Research instrument and procedure
Semi-structured interviews were used as the instrument for data-
gathering, and the interview guide included mainly open-ended
questions. The closed questions were about the participants’ de-
mographic information. The set of questions was conditioned by
the research’s general objectives, addressing the following topics:
profile of the participants, habits regarding visits to museums, and
suggestions on solutions to enhance their future museum experi-
ence.
The study was conducted between January and July of 2019,
mainly at the institutions where interviewees were members. In
eight of the cases, the interviews were conducted in participants’
homes, and five persons asked to meet them at their workplaces. All
interviews were individual and performed face-to-face, except for
nine cases (12.5%) in which it was necessary to do the interviews
by telephone. A document with the initial protocol was read aloud
at the beginning of each interview and asked for permission to
audio record the data-gathering session. Each individual gave their
consent to participate in the study by signing the document. The
exceptions to this were the cases of telephone interviews, in which
participants gave their oral consent, and the minor-age cases, for
which their parents previously signed the document when arrang-
ing the interviews.

3.3
Tools for data analysis
The average duration of each interview was 29 minutes and 17
seconds, excluding the initial protocol. The NVivo 12 software
‘transcribe mode’ tools were used to transcribe the audio files man-
ually. The same software was used to conduct the qualitative data
analysis, following the thematic analysis method [5]. The coded
themes derived inductively from the collected data and their iden-
tification was performed through a semantic approach, in which
the explicit level of meanings of the data was considered in order
to identify the different patterns.
Regarding the answers related to the profile of the VI participants,
as well as their habits concerning visits to museums, it was possible
to convert the qualitative data into quantitative data, and the IBM
SPSS 26 software was used to carry out descriptive and exploratory
statistical analysis of these research topics.

RESULTS
4.1
Participant’s profile
Of the 44 (61.1%) individuals who reported to be blind, 18 were
early-blind (EB) and 26 late-blind (LB). The remaining 28 (38.9%)
participants had low vision: 16 severe (SVI), 9 moderate (MoVI),
and 3 had mild visual impairment (MiVI). It is mentioned that 75%
of the interviewees in this research had visual references (LB and
partially sighted), and that the average age of vision loss of the
LB participants is approximately 30 years old (M=29.6; SD=17.5).
The group was relatively homogeneous in terms of gender, i.e.,
51.4% were female, and 48.6% were male. Interviewees’ age ranged
from 14 to 87 years old (M=48.7; SD=17.1). The predominant age
group was 42-57 (33.3%), followed by 58-73 (32%), 26-41 (18%), 14-
25 (13.9%) and 74-87 (2.8%) years old. Regarding their education
level, basic school represents the highest education level completed
by 38.9% of the individuals, and the secondary school was the
second level of education achieved by most of the participants
(37.5%). Seventeen participants (23.6%) completed higher education:
12.5% holds a bachelor’s degree, and 11.1% holds a master’s degree.
Concerning their area of living, 52.7% live in a metropolitan area
(Porto, Lisbon and Setúbal), whereas the rest of the participants live
in less populated Districts: Braga (12.5%), Viana do Castelo (11.1%),
Viseu (9.7%), Vila Real (6.9%), Aveiro (2.8%), and Évora, Guarda and
Santarém (4.2%).
4.2
Habits regarding visits to museums
More than half of the participants (56.9%) reported they visit mu-
seums less than once every two years, and 22.2% informed that
they go one to two times a year. Five participants (6.9%) use to visit
museums three or four times in a year, and seven (9.7%) reported
they visit more than four times in a year. Three participants (4.2%)
have never visited any museum at the time of their interviews.
Of the total answers given by the 69 people who frequent muse-
ums to the question about whom they visit museums with, 34.1%
referred to the associations where they are members, 31.7% stated
visits with close family members, 20.3% with friends, and 13% visits
in school contexts. One person (0.8%) affirmed had visited a mu-
seum alone. Regarding the question about if they enjoy going to
museums, 46.4% of the participants responded “yes”, 34.8% said
“more or less”, and 18.8% revealed they do not enjoy visiting those
places.
4.3
Improvement suggestions to enhance the
visiting experience in museums
All the 72 interviewees shared suggestions about the aspects they
considered that must be improved and provided solutions to enable
more enjoyable visits and enhance future museum experiences.
The answers provided by the three participants who stated had
never visited museums were also considered, given its relevance.
A total of 479 commentaries were coded during the performed
qualitative analysis, which allowed to co-design the guidelines
towards a framework that will be discussed in the next section.

AN INTEGRATIVE FRAMEWORK
CO-CREATED TO ENHANCE THE MUSEUM
EXPERIENCE
Based on the qualitative analysis, it was concluded that a frame-
work must support integrating the different phases identified as
relating to the experience of visiting cultural institutions: pre-visit,
on-site visit, and post-visit. Furthermore, the data analysis per-
formed revealed that it is imperative to ensure that the framework
also articulates the strategies to promote sensory, intellectual, and
physical access, so individuals are more likely to feel a sense of
autonomy during the various phases of a visit, despite their diverse
degrees of visual impairments.
5.1
Pre-visit planning
5.1.1
Museum Website: Accessible, Informative and with Inclusive
Language [Intellectual Access]. Should follow the Web Content Ac-
cessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to guarantee users the intellectual
access to information. Besides the introductory presentation of the
museum and its collection, museum websites should use inclusive
language to welcome potential visitors with disabilities, and also
provide useful information to VI individuals planning a visit: if
anything can be touched during the on-site visit and what; the
availability of audio guides and guided tours; if there are audio
descriptions or supports in Braille; accessible events and services
provided; if guided dogs are allowed inside; entrance fees and costs
of these services.
5.1.2
Proper Dissemination of Information about the Museum [In-
tellectual Access]. In order to reach VI audiences, museums should
disseminate information through e-mail and user-friendly social
media channels (taking into account the WCAG). Since not every
participant stated feeling comfortable using digital devices and
accessing websites, the information must also be directly dissemi-
nated to schools, associations, and other institutions where people
are part or attend, so it can be delivered to them.
5.2
On-site visit
5.2.1
Presentation of the Museum Space and Exhibitions [Intellec-
tual Access]. Participants suggested that museums must provide
them with complementary ways of accessing information about
the exhibitions’ spaces and their organization through audio at the
19

beginning of a visit. According to the vast majority of the intervie-
wees, resorting to sound would be more useful in the context of a
spontaneous visit than having to read this information in Braille
or printed media, since the awareness of the contents would be
faster, more enjoyable and more convenient if listening. They also
informed that Braille cannot be considered an inclusive reading
medium because not every person developed adequate literacy to
read it, and texts with large-sized fonts and adequate contrast ratios
do not serve all persons with low vision.
5.2.2
Exhibits’ Information Presentation [Intellectual Access]. It
should be prioritized the use of audio instead of Braille or printed
media to convey the exhibits’ information, for the same reasons pre-
viously discussed. It is also necessary to use appropriate descriptive
language, so the detail of information and used terms to present the
exhibits’ contents are adapter to the reality of someone who cannot
entirely rely on her/his vision to sense the world. The museological
information must be as concise as possible to convey the crucial
aspects, to avoid the excess of information and visitors’ fatigue and
loss of interest.
5.2.3
Physical Objects: Replicas, Models and Reliefs [Sensory Ac-
cess]. Sensory access to physical objects was identified as essential
to an enhanced and meaningful museum visit, serving different
purposes. 3D models of museum spaces can enable the creation of
mental representations of its organization, while 3D models of the
museum building allow them to create accurate mental images of
the architecture and other relevant details that are hard to express
by language. On the other hand, 3D replicas of exhibits (at least
of the most relevant) were pointed out as vital to effectively make
sense of the objects, which are, generally, the purpose of museum
exhibitions. It should be used reliefs for accessing bi-dimensional
artworks like paintings, photos, or others only perceived through
vision. The sensory access to physical objects must combine both
touch and hearing, at least, to be effective, and the access to these
objects should be available while visiting the entire museum, with
the aim to promote inclusion.
5.2.4
Magnified Images to Amplify Visual Capacities and Adjusted
Lighting of the Exhibits [Sensory Access]. Participants with low
vision highlighted that they still have some vision and wish to
use it to perceive the museum objects and artworks. Tablets and
screens with zoomable high-resolution images of the exhibits can
be provided to visualize better the pieces’ details, preferentially
close to the originals. Brighter lighting of the exhibits, on the other
hand, could also improve their visiting experiences by helping them
using their remaining visual capacity.
5.2.5
Exhibition Space Design and Assistive Guide for Museum Nav-
igation [Physical Access]. Exhibitions must be designed to afford a
circulation route within the spaces free of physical obstacles and
to promote a sense of safety and autonomy on the VI visitors. The
use of an assistive guide that automatically provides contextual
information was suggested to enhance their sense of autonomy and
control while moving in exhibitions. It is recommended to be used
as complementary ways to offer accurate feedback when approach-
ing points of interest, provide route assistance indications while
moving, and alert visitors.
5.3
Post-visit phase
5.3.1
Museum Website: with Additional Contents for Promoting Fur-
ther Engagement [Intellectual Access]. Interviewees recommended
that websites included audio described videos and allows listen-
ing to the audio-clips from the audio guides. The possibility of
exploring those materials, and additional ones not featured in the
exhibitions, would benefit new discoveries and promote their inter-
est and engagement, motivating further visits.
5.3.2
Social Media Platforms to Strengthen Connections [Intellec-
tual Access]. Social media platforms can be used as a strategy to
strengthen connections with the VI community and make muse-
ums more relevant after the on-site visit. In order to captivate their
attention and foster engagement, it is essential to transmit them a
feeling of welcoming and that their interaction with the museum
through this media will add value and generate positive outcomes,
besides implementing the WCGA.
5.3.3
Souvenirs: Recalling the Visit Experience [Sensory Access].
Participants expressed the interest of taking souvenirs home and
commented about the role that those objects can assume in recalling
personal memories of their visits to museums. To this end, some
exemplars of souvenirs can include miniature replicas of museum
objects, reliefs, or materials that were available to touch on the
on-site visit; fragrances related to exhibitions; objects that produce
music, voices, or sounds heard when visiting the museum; among
others. Those souvenirs can also be digitally augmented and point
to the museum website or other relevant web content related to the
exhibition, for instance.

CONCLUSIONS
The present research proposes guidelines towards a framework
to enhance the museum experience of blind and partially sighted
visitors, linking the pre, during, and post-visit phases with the ac-
cess required to provide in each of them. It was co-created based
on the perspectives of 72 VI study participants, collected through
semi-structured interviews. The framework has some limitations
and reveals new research opportunities. It was grounded on the
opinions and suggestions of a reduced number of Portuguese indi-
viduals, of whom 75% had visual references. It also did not include
the diverse museum professionals’ perspectives to obtain a more
in-deep perception of the aspects proposed on the framework. Al-
though during the design of the framework was made an effort to
cover its applicability in the diverse museum types, it implies di-
rect challenges to museums, namely concerning their practices for
exhibitions, curatorship, and management, to name a few. As a last
consideration, the proposed framework does not intend to replace
accessible guided tours nor other inclusive activities in museums,
but rather to use technology to complement them and also allow
VI people to have access to museum-related content whenever they
wish to make spontaneous visits.
