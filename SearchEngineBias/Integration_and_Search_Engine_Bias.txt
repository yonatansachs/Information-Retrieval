Abstract
Competition authorities all over the world worry that integration between search engines
(mainly Google) and publishers could lead to abuses of dominant position. In particular, one
concern is that of own-content bias, meaning that Google would bias its rankings in favor of
the publishers it owns or has an interest in, to the detriment of competitors and users. In
order to investigate this issue, we develop a theoretical framework in which the search engine
(i) allocates users across publishers, and (ii) competes with publishers to attract advertisers.
We show that the search engine is biased against publishers that display many ads—even
without integration. Although integration may lead to own-content bias, it can also reduce
bias by increasing the value of a marginal consumer to the search engine. Integration also
has a positive eﬀect on users by reducing the nuisance costs due to excessive advertising. Its
net eﬀect is therefore ambiguous in general, and we provide suﬃcient conditions for it to be
desirable or not.
Keywords: search engine, integration, advertising, bias.

Introduction

The importance of Internet search engines is indisputable. They process billions of queries each
day worldwide and, to a large extent, create order in the web out of a clutter of information.
The business model of most search engines relies on two pillars, namely organic results (generally
displayed to the left) and paid results (or sponsored links, to the right and on top). Both kinds of
results are relevant to queries entered by users, the main diﬀerence being that the search engine
does not receive payments from publishers who appear on organic listings, whereas sponsored links
are bought by advertisers. Whilst organic results receive the majority of clicks,1 paid results have
proved to be very profitable, generating billions of dollars of annual advertising revenue.
The commercial nature of search engines, coupled with their essential role as information gatekeepers, has unsurprisingly attracted scrutiny from competition authorities all over the world.
Google has been the main target of investigations, in part due to its dominant position in the
search market (market share of over 90% in Europe, 65% in the US).2 One of the most salient concerns expressed by competition authorities is the idea that Google, which owns many specialized
publishers (for example, Google maps, Youtube, and Zagat), displays organic results in such a way
as to favor these publishers, to the detriment of its competitors and, more importantly, to that of
users. For instance, in 2013 the US Federal Trade Commission concluded a lengthy investigation
of Google’s business practices in which the regulator acknowledged that Google has introduced
changes to its search algorithm that privileges its own content—ammounting to what is “commonly known as search bias” (FTC, 2013). Despite this observation, the FTC determined that
the changes in question are likely to improve the experience of users and therefore do not warrant
legal intervention. The debate, though, is far from settled. The European Commission—which
explicitly listed own-content bias as one of its four concerns related to potential abuses of dominant market position by Google—has been more hawkish and is currently negotiating a settlement
with the search engine that is likely to include measures aimed at aﬀording more prominence to
Google’s rivals.
The existence of such a “bias” is diﬃcult to establish empirically. In an attempt to measure it,
Edelman and Lockwood (2011) compare the results of several search engines for a list of queries,
and argue that Google tends to favor its own-content more than other major search engines. On

the other hand, Wright (2011), after extending Edelman and Lockwood’s initial study to other
keywords, argues that the evidence “do[es] not support claims that own-content bias is of the
nature, quality, or magnitude to generate plausible antitrust concerns”.3
While the current debate mostly focuses on whether Google actually provides an unfair advantage to its own services, this paper tackles the broader question of the eﬀects of integration between
a dominant search engine and a publisher, taking into account, on top of the issue of own-content
bias, the potential implications that such a move would have on the advertising market. To do
so, we build a model that incorporates some key features of the search industry. In the model,
consumers may use a monopolistic search engine in order to find some content that is relevant to
their query. Upon receiving the query, the search engine, through its organic results, can direct
users towards one of two publishers, which are initially unknown to consumers. We refer to the
mapping from a query to a result as an allocation rule. Both publishers as well as the search engine
are strictly ad-financed, and advertisers view space on these three media platforms as imperfect
substitutes. Consumers dislike ads but cannot observe how many of them are displayed on each
publisher prior to visiting it.4
We consider three cases. In the unintegrated case, the publishers are independent with respect
to the search engine. Given that publishers do not receive payments from users, they display too
many ads from a consumer surplus point of view. The provision of advertising is nevertheless
insuﬃcient from advertisers’ point of view, because of publishers’ market power. Explicitly modeling the three sides of the market (consumers, publishers and advertisers) allows us to shed light
on the forces governing the optimal allocation of traﬃc, both from consumers’ perspective and
from the search engine’s. While consumers would value an allocation rule that takes into account
relevance and the nuisance generated by excessive levels of advertising, the search engine must
also factor in the eﬀect of its allocation rule on the price at which it sells its sponsored links. This
implies in particular that the search engine will penalize publishers that display many ads more
than consumers would wish.
We next turn to the study of the case in which the search engine and one publisher enter in a
contractual arrangement by which the search engine serves the advertisements on the publisher’s
site and keeps a share of the revenues, while the publisher remains free of choosing how many

advertising slots to sell. We refer to this arrangement as partial integration (without control).
Partial integration creates a monetary incentive for the search engine to direct more users towards
that specific publisher, but we show that there exist conditions under which it leads to a reduction
in bias, in particular when user participation is very sensitive to the quality of the results. The
main reason for this is that partial integration increases the search engine’s marginal return to
attracting users on its platform.
Finally, we consider a market structure in which the search engine is fully integrated with a
publisher, and therefore also chooses how many ads will be displayed on the publisher’s site. The
fact that advertisers view ads on the search engine and on websites as imperfect substitutes implies
that such a merger leads the integrated structure to lower its supply of ad space, to the detriment
of advertisers and to the benefit of users, who are more satisfied by visiting the search engine’s
own site compared to the unintegrated case.
As a result, we see that the eﬀects of integration on consumers’ welfare are ambiguous in
general. By focusing on some key parameters, we derive some policy implications of the model.

Related literature
Much of the interest in search engines has been focused on the auctions used to sell advertisements
(see, for example, Athey and Ellison, 2011; Chen and He, 2011; Edelman, Ostrovsky, and Schwarz,
2007; Varian, 2007). A more recent literature considers search engines’ platform design decisions,
and addresses the question of whether search engines will always wish to maximize result quality.
For examples of such papers see de Cornière (2011), Eliaz and Spiegler (2011), Taylor (2013b),
and White (forthcoming). Unlike these papers, where result quality is a purely vertical notion,
we introduce ‘real’ bias by adding a horizontal component to search engines’ algorithm design
decision: in our paper, when a search engine privileges some publisher, it necessarily does so at
the expense of another.
Burguet, Caminal, and Ellman (2013) also look at how ad market incentives aﬀect the quality
of organic and sponsored links on a search engine. In contrast to their work, we abstract from the
design of the auction mechanism but endogenize publishers’ ad supply decisions. Doing so allows
us to study how the relative attractiveness of publishers to consumers is endogenous to the market
structure, which has a variety of interesting theoretical and practical implications.
We operationalize bias as a decision by the search engine to direct some consumers away from

their ideal publisher. In this sense our work is similar in spirit to that of Hagiu and Jullien (2011),
Armstrong and Zhou (2011) and Inderst and Ottaviani (2012), who consider the incentives of
intermediaries to bias their advice in favor of firms from which they receive larger payments. The
structure of the model is also reminiscent of some papers on network neutrality (Choi and Kim
(2010) for instance), in which “bias” takes the form of priority rules in favor of one publisher. Our
paper mainly diﬀers from the preceding ones in two aspects: firstly, search engines in the baseline
version of our model do not receive payments from the publishers to which they link and therefore
do not have a direct financial incentive to bias their results. Secondly, search engines compete with
those publishers to sell advertisements. The latter point introduces consumer multi-homing in the
analysis, and thus complements a nascent literature on this dimension of media markets (Athey,
Calvano, and Gans (2010), Anderson, Foros, and Kind (2011), Ambrus, Calvano, and Reisinger
(2012)). Indeed, since in our paper users visit the search engine and a publisher, they can be
reached by advertisers on both “platforms”, which, as in the above papers, reduces the ability of
each platform to extract revenue from advertisers, all the more so that consumers are exposed to
many ads on the other outlet they visit. The novelty in our approach is that the search engine is
able to influence which publisher consumers will visit, so that it can alleviate the multi-homing
externality by directing users towards publishers with low level of advertising.5 In related spirit,
Taylor (2013a) studies how a media platform can aﬀect the extent of multi-homing through the
quality of its content. Ellman and Germano (2009) consider the incentives of a newspaper to bias
its coverage against content detrimental to advertisers.
White and Jain (2010) also study a model in which both the search engine and publishers make
money through advertising. However, they do not model the advertising side of the market, nor
do they model the way the search engine allocates traﬃc among publishers, and instead focus on
the distraction imposed on users.

Description of the model

Consider a market composed of one search engine (i = 0) and two publishers (i = 1, 2), a continuum
of mass one of consumers, and a representative advertiser.

2.1

The search for content

Publishers 1 and 2 produce some horizontally diﬀerentiated content. We model this diﬀerentiation
by assuming that they are located at the ends of a Hotelling segment of unit length: publisher 1
to the left, publisher 2 to the right.
Consumers are uniformly distributed along the segment, and the utility they derive from the
consumption of a publisher’s content is a decreasing function of the distance between their position,
x ∈ [0; 1], and that of the publisher. If the distance is d, the utility from reading the content is v(d),
v being a decreasing function. However, the market is characterized by incomplete information:
consumers know what their tastes are, but they are ex ante ignorant of the mapping between their
tastes and their position on the line, and are therefore unable to identify which publisher is the
more relevant.
The only way for consumers to access content is to use the search engine. When a consumer
decides to do so, he enters a qualitative query that reveals his taste. The search engine is uniquely
endowed with knowledge of the function that maps a user’s query into a latent location on the
Hotelling segment, and it directs him towards one of the two publishers accordingly. We refer to
the search engine’s decision on which publisher to promote as an allocation rule, and we focus on
allocation rules that have a threshold structure, as made explicit below:
Definition 1. A search engine’s allocation rule is a threshold x̄, such that all users with x < x̄
are directed toward publisher 1 and all those with x ≥ x̄ are directed toward publisher 2.
We allow the search engine to choose any x̄ in [0; 1], so that it has perfect control over the
allocation of traﬃc between the publishers. This simplifying assumption is broadly consistent
with Edelman and Lai (2013), who exploit a natural experiment involving variations in the layout
of Google search results pages to show that relatively minor changes in design can have a large
eﬀect on the traﬃc flowing from a search engine.6
Consumers incur a search cost when they use the search engine. This search cost θ is distributed
across the population according to a strictly increasing (on its support) c.d.f. F , and is independent
of consumers’ position. Write f for the associated density.
6
One could easily amend the model so as to restrict the search engine to choose x̄ ∈ [xL , xH ], with 0 < xL <
xH < 1, but such a specification does not deliver additional insights.

Advertising

Both publishers and the search engine are financed exclusively through advertising. The quantity
of advertisements displayed on website i is denoted qi . We will refer to ads on Publishers 1 and
2 as banners, whereas ads on the search engine are sponsored links.7 We assume throughout the
paper that the quantity of sponsored links is exogenously fixed at q0 . This allows us to focus on the
allocation rule as the main strategic tool of the search engine, and therefore clarifies the exposition
of our original insights. The case in which q0 is endogenously chosen by the search engine, for
which the main results still hold, is relegated to the appendix.
Although there are no monetary transfers between consumers and publishers, we assume that
consumers dislike ads, so that they “pay” with their attention. If a user is directed towards
publisher i, he suﬀers a disutility δi (qi ).8,9 The utility of a user who is directed toward publisher
i, which is at a distance d from his ideal location, is therefore
u(d, qi ) = v(d) − δi (qi ) − θ.

(1)

On the other side of the market are advertisers who wish to reach users. For simplicity, we focus
on the case of a representative advertiser who wishes to send several messages to each consumer.
It can reach consumers either when they are on the search engine page, or when they visit a
publisher. Given an allocation rule x̄, the expected per-user revenue of the advertiser, if it buys
q0 ad slots on the search engine and q1 and q2 slots on publishers’ websites, is
R(Q, x̄) = r0 (q0 ) + x̄r1 (q0 , q1 ) + (1 − x̄)r2 (q0 , q2 ),

(2)

with r0 (0) = r1 (q0 , 0) = r2 (q0 , 0) = 0. The r0 function represents the revenue from contacting users
on the search engine, whilst r1 and r2 capture the additional revenue for advertisers generated
by a user who is directed towards publisher 1 and 2 respectively. In Appendix A we provide
microfoundations for this revenue function, as well as an alternative interpretation with multiple
heterogenous advertisers buying at most one slot.
As suggested by our notation, for i ∈ {1, 2}, ri depends on both q0 and qi . However, since a

We use the term “banner” for expositional simplicity. Some publishers are actually vertical search engines with
sponsored links. We discuss this point in section 6.

See section 6 for a discussion of the case of ad-loving consumers.

Since q0 is exogenous, it does not matter whether we write δi (q0 , qi ) or δi (qi ).

consumer cannot visit both publisher 1 and publisher 2, r1 does not depend on q2 , and vice-versa.
Notice also that r1 and r2 do not depend on x̄. The underlying assumption is that the location of
a user in the content space is independent of its attitude towards advertisers.10
The key assumption of our model is that advertisers view ad space on the search engine and on
publishers as imperfect substitutes: sponsored links and banners are two ways to reach consumers,
even if they are not equivalent. Substitutability means that the marginal value of a type of ads
(sponsored link or banner) decreases as the number of ads of the other type increases. Formally,
we have

∂ 2 ri (q0 , qi )
≤0
∂q0 ∂qi

(3)

for i = 1, 2. There is some disagreement about the strength of substitutability: Hahn and Singer
(2008) provide evidence for strict substitutability, whilst the FTC (2007) took the position that the
two ad markets are independent. Our model admits both possibilities and allows us to comment
on the role of the strength substitutability in determining the outcome of integration. In particular, the limiting case with independent demands corresponds to the conditions in (3) holding with
equality. The degree of substitutability is likely to diﬀer substantially across content sectors and
website types. For instance, a vertical search site (such as Expedia) seems like it might be particularly well-placed to substitute for a search engine in providing ads that are carefully targeted at
a consumer’s search query. Indeed, on a more general level, improvements in publishers’ ability to
target advertisements are likely to make the two forms of ads closer substitutes because display
ads that are well-targeted can be used to stimulate a direct consumer response—a function that
has typically been associated with search ads.
Note that ri (q0 , 0) = 0 implies
ri (q0 , qi ) =

(4)

In words: holding constant the number of ads on publisher i, an increase in the supply of search
ads causes the advertiser revenues flowing from ads on i to fall.
10

This assumption is discussed in Appendix A.

We also assume that ri is concave in qi for all i and, to focus on interior solutions, that
∂ri

∂qi qi =0

> 0. Concavity may result from the marginal ads being inherently less valuable, or from a

decrease in the time spent by the user on the publisher due to the extra nuisance implied by the
marginal ad, making it less likely that he notices a product he is interested in.
Finally, we assume that payments to publishers are made on a per-impression basis so that the
expected per-user profit of advertisers is
πa = R(Q, x̄) − q0 P0 − x̄q1 P1 − (1 − x̄)q2 P2 ,

(5)

where Pi is the price of an advertisement on i.11 Ad prices are determined so as to equalize supply
(the qi ’s oﬀered by publishers) and demand by advertisers.
Figure 1 represents the market structure.

A remark on sponsored links In this paper we consider the case in which publishers can only
attract traﬃc through organic links. It turns out that allowing publishers to buy sponsored links
by participating in the auction would not significantly aﬀect our results. To see this formally,
consider the following variant of our model. Assume that publishers can participate in an auction
for the sponsored links. Consumers, when facing diﬀerent (sponsored or organic) links, are able
to distinguish links that direct towards a publisher from links that direct towards a merchant
(the advertisers in our model). If a consumer faces two links to publishers, one organic and one
sponsored, let α be the (endogenous) probability with which he clicks on the organic link.
Suppose that α < 1. In the auction, the identity of the winner depends on publishers’ expected
per-impression revenues αqiP i (since this is how much they are willing to pay per-impression).
Notice that this is independent of the position of the user on the Hotelling line, so that the
expected relevance of a sponsored link publisher is that of a random draw. However, if x̄ ∈ (0; 1),
the expected relevance of the organic link is strictly higher than that, and so the user optimally
sets α = 1. In other words, publishers’ sponsored links are never clicked on in equilibrium.12
11
Per-click pricing for sponsored links would not alter our qualitative results, as long as there is substitutability
between sponsored links and banners.
12
Notice that this logic does not imply that all sponsored links are never clicked on, since it does not cover links
to merchant websites.

Information and timing

The timing of the game is the following:
1. Publishers 1 and 2 simultaneously choose their advertising level q1 and q2 . The search engine
chooses an allocation rule x̄.13
2. Advertisers observe x̄, q0 , q1 and q2 . The advertising market clears: P0 , P1 and P2 equalize
supply and demand for each publisher.
3. Consumers observe x̄. They decide whether to use the search engine or not by comparing
the surplus they expect to gain from doing so to their idiosyncratic search cost.
4. Each user enters a query, and visits the publisher suggested by the search engine.
The assumption that users do not observe q1 and q2 is consistent with the fact that they have
no prior knowledge of the content oﬀered by the two publishers. The assumption that x̄ is observed
by consumers may seem strange if one takes the model at face value. Indeed, consumers certainly
cannot observe the algorithm used by search engines. Our interpretation of this assumption of
the model is, in a broad sense, that a lower quality of results will eventually drive some users
away from the search engine, either because they hear about it in the media or they experience it
themselves. For completeness, we analyze the case in which x̄ is not observed by consumers in the
appendix.
We look for Nash equilibria in which (i) consumers’ participation strategies are optimal for
every x̄ given (correct) expectations about q1 and q2 , (ii) taking the consumers’ participation
strategy as given, the choices of q1 , q2 , and x̄ are mutual best responses, and (iii) ad prices clear
the market. We first solve backwards steps 2 to 4. Then we study three cases in order to solve
step 1: in the first case, the publishers are independent from the search engine; in the second case
the search engine partially integrates with a publisher; in the third case the search engine takes
full ownership control of a publisher. The diﬀerence between partial and full integration is that
13
One could find arguments in favor of a diﬀerent timing, either to have x̄ chosen before the qi ’s, or after. For
example, if the search engine were to program its algorithm to condition its results upon the ad levels on sites 1
and 2 then the game would be formally equivalent to one in which the search engine moves after the publishers.
Conversely publishers often tailor their design decisions to game the search algorithm and optimize their search
ranking. We are agnostic on this point; in eﬀect, search engines and publishers appear to be stuck in a kind of Red
Queen’s race in which neither side is able to definitively act as a leader. Simultaneous actions also turn out to be
more tractable.

12

in the former case the search engine obtains a share of the publisher’s revenue but cannot control
its choice of qi , whilst in the latter we allow the search engine to exercise full control over the
integrated publisher’s policy.

3.1

Consumer participation and ad market clearing.
Consumer participation

Suppose that the search engine has chosen the allocation rule x̄, and that consumers expect
publishers 1 and 2 to choose ad levels q1e and q2e respectively. Then the expected disutility (or
nuisance) from advertising is
∆(x̄, Qe ) ≡ ∆e ≡ x̄δ1 (q1e ) + (1 − x̄)δ2 (q2e ).
For a given allocation rule x̄, the expected value from reading the content is
ρ(x̄) ≡ E[v(d)|x̄] =

�

x̄

v(z)dz +
0

�

1
x̄

v(1 − z)dz.

We will refer to ρ as the relevance of the search engine. Its second derivative is ρ�� (x̄) = v � (x̄) +
v � (1 − x̄) < 0, hence ρ is a concave function of x̄, maximized at x̄ = 1/2. For given values of the
nuisance ∆e and relevance ρ, the expected utility of a consumer is therefore
U (ρ, ∆e , θ) = ρ − ∆e − θ.
A consumer will engage in search if and only if U (ρ, ∆e , θ) ≥ 0, which gives us the participation
rate F (ρ − ∆e )

3.2

Definition of bias

The expression for user participation makes it clear that consumers care about two things when
they consider using the search engine: they want the content to be relevant, but also for it to be
accompanied by as few advertisements as possible. This leads us to the following important observation: consumers may wish to sacrifice relevance in order to reduce the nuisance from advertising.

Integration and Search Engine Bias

13

So we are naturally led to ask: what is the optimal allocation rule from consumers’ point of view?
Definition 2. For a given expected level of ads, Qe , the user-optimal allocation rule is defined as
x∗ (Qe ) ≡ argmax F (ρ − ∆e ).
x̄

Notice that x∗ is well defined since ρ − ∆e is a strictly concave function of x̄ (∆e is linear in x̄),

which implies that it is strictly quasi-concave; the c.d.f. F being increasing implies that F (ρ − ∆e )
is also strictly quasi-concave.
Because users dislike ads, we have the following result:
Lemma 1. The user-optimal cut-oﬀ, x∗ , is decreasing in q1e and increasing in q2e .
Proof. The first order condition for determination of x∗ is
�
�
dF (ρ − ∆e )
∂∆e
e
�
= f (ρ − ∆ ) ρ (x̄) −
= 0,
dx̄
∂ x̄
which can be simplified to
ρ� (x̄) = δ1 (q0 , q1e ) − δ2 (q0 , q2e ).
The right hand side is increasing (decreasing) in q1 (in q2 ), and hence so must be the left hand
side. That ρ�� (x̄) < 0 completes the proof.
Example 1. A simple example utility function consistent with the above is a Hotelling model of
content preference with linear transport cost, t, paired with linear ad nuisance costs:

which yields

U (ρ, ∆) = 1 −

Note that this example exhibits the more general property that x∗ need not equal 1/2 because
consumers hope to maximize U rather than ρ. With this in mind, we do not view x �= 1/2 as
constituting bias per se. Rather, we describe a search engine as being biased in favor of publisher
i when it sends to i users who would obtain higher surplus from visiting i’s rival. More formally,

14

Alexandre de Cornière and Greg Taylor

Definition 3. We say that the search engine is biased in favor of publisher 1 when x̄ > x∗ and in
favor of publisher 2 when x̄ < x∗ . The search engine is unbiased if x̄ = x∗ . We refer to |x∗ − x̄| as
the absolute magnitude of bias.

3.3

Ad market clearing

The supply of advertising space is given by q0 , q1 and q2 . On the demand side, as is standard in
Cournot models, the representative advertiser acts as a price-taker. Given the observed allocation
rule x̄ and a price vector (P0 , P1 , P2 ), the advertiser’s profit is given by (5). The advertiser is
indiﬀerent between buying and not buying an extra advertising slot on website i if and only if its
marginal revenue ( ∂R(Q,x̄)
) is equal to the price of the slot (Pi ). The demand for advertising space
∂qi
(q0d , q1d , q2d ) is thus implicitly given by the following conditions:
∂r0 (q0d )
∂r1 (q0d , q1d )
∂r2 (q0d , q2d )
P0 =
+ x̄
+ (1 − x̄)
,
∂q0
∂q0
∂q0

(6)

P1 =

∂r1 (q0d , q1d )
,
∂q1

(7)

P2 =

∂r2 (q0d , q2d )
.
∂q2

(8)

For the market to clear, prices are set so that qid = qi for i ∈ {0, 1, 2}. This gives us the inverse
demand functions P0 (Q, x̄), P1 (Q) and P2 (Q).
From (3), substitutability implies that P1 and P2 are non-increasing functions of q0 , and P0 is
non-increasing in q1 and q2 .
Example 1 (Continued). One of the simplest specifications that satisfies the above properties is
the following:
r0 (q0 ) = α0 q0 −
ri (q0 , qi ) = αi qi −

β0 2

2 0

βi 2
q − γ i q0 qi ,

which leads to
P0 = α0 − β0 q0 − x̄γ1 q1 − (1 − x̄)γ2 q2 ,
P1 = α1 − β1 q1 − γ1 q0 ,

P2 = α2 − β2 q2 − γ2 q0 .
In this specification, the degree of substitutability between ads on the search engine and on
publisher i is measured by γi . When γi is large, an increase in the number of banners (qi ) causes a
large decrease in the price of sponsored links (P0 ), and reciprocally. The β parameters control the
concavity of advertiser revenue. A high βi may be interpreted as a strong sensitivity of users to
ad levels: an increase in qi makes users spend much less time on publisher i, so that the marginal
revenue of ads decreases quickly. When we use this linear specification later in the paper, we
assume that αi , βi , γi > 0 for all i and, to ensure that the optimization problem has a well-defined
interior solution, that β0 βi − γi2 > 0 for i ∈ {1, 2}.

Equilibrium in the non-integrated case

As a benchmark, let us look at the situation without vertical integration—indicated by an N I
superscript (for ‘no integration’). This section is of independent interest, since it highlights the key
incentives of a search engine when it comes to choosing how to allocate traﬃc among independent
publishers. Before turning to this question, let us look at the advertising decisions.
The profits of the three websites are
π0 = F (ρ − ∆e )q0 P0 ;

π1 = x̄F (ρ − ∆e )q1 P1 ;

π2 = (1 − x̄)F (ρ − ∆e )q2 P2 .

(9)

Since ad levels are unobserved, the number of active users, F (ρ − ∆e ), does not depend on the
actual values of q1 and q2 but only on their expected value. The first-order conditions for publishers
1 and 2 is thus the standard formula:
∂πiN I
∂Pi
= 0 ⇐⇒
qi + Pi = 0,
∂qi
∂qi

(10)

which implicitly defines the equilibrium values of q1N I and q2N I . Each publisher raises the quantity
of advertisements it sells until the point at which the marginal benefit (the extra ad sold) equals
the infra-marginal losses (the lower price on all the ads sold so far).
The search engine chooses its allocation rule, x̄, as a best response to the publishers’ ad volumes

IIB

The search engine must balance three eﬀects in order to maximize revenue. The first one, captured
by the term f (ρ − ∆e )ρ� (x̄), is related to the relevance of results. Other things being equal, users
enjoy relevance, and improving it helps to increase their number.
However, relevance is not the only characteristic that users enjoy. They may prefer to be shown
a less relevant link when this results in them being directed to sites with fewer advertisements. The
term −f (ρ − ∆e ) ∂∆
in (12) reflects this concern. The desire to attract users explains why Google,
∂ x̄
for example, publically announces measures to penalize advertising spam sites in its ranking algorithm.14 These spam sites are the ones that cause a large disutility to users, i.e such that δi (qi )
is relatively large. These two eﬀects constitute the quality of the results provided by the search
engine. Quality is maximal when

dF (ρ−∆e )
dx̄

= 0, i.e at x̄ = x∗ . The first term on the left-hand side

of (12) thus measures the Return to Quality (RQ) for the search engine.
The second term of (12) embodies the more subtle observation that the optimal bias from the
search engine’s point of view is partially determined by strategic considerations over the advertising
market. Here, the search engine will use x̄ as an instrument to maintain a high price P0 for its
own sponsored links. Note that, from (6), we have

The term

number when ads are closer substitutes. In order to maintain a high price for its ads, the search

≤ 0 (see Equation 3), the search engine will bias its results against a publisher with

a relatively high number of ads. By doing so, it ensures that advertisers have fewer opportunities
to advertise their products, which drives up the price of the sponsored links.15 The strength of
�
�
� ∂ 2 ri �
this eﬀect depends upon the size of � ∂q0 ∂qi �: if this is large so that i’s ads are particularly close
substitutes for sponsored links then the search engine will have an especially strong incentive to

direct users away from i. Because the bias does not result from direct monetary incentives, but
operates through a price mechanism, we label this eﬀect the Indirect Incentive to Bias (IIB).
Summarizing:
Proposition 1. In the non-integrated case, the search engine biases its rankings against publishers

that display many ads or whose ads are close substitutes for its own sponsored links. Too many
consumers are directed to site 1 if
∂r1

<

∂q0

and too many consumers are directed to site 2 if

∂q0

For instance, if we use the linear demand specification introduced in Example 1, we have
∂r1
∂q0

−

∂r2
∂q0

= γ2 q2 − γ1 q1 . If γ2 q2 ≥ γ1 q1 , the first order condition (11) will be satisfied for

dn
dx̄

< 0,

i.e x̄ > x∗ . This example clearly illustrates that the incentive to bias against publisher 2 not only
depends on the expected level of advertising on each publisher, but also on the relative degrees of
substitutability, γ1 and γ2 . In the particular case in which γ1 = γ2 , we see that the search engine
puts too much weight on the level of ads compared to consumers’ ideal.
It follows straightforwardly from Proposition 1 that the search engine will implement unbiased
results if the publishers are symmetric.
Definition 4. Publishers are symmetric if δ1 (q0 , ·) = δ2 (q0 , ·) and r1 (q0 , ·) = r2 (q0 , ·).
Corollary 1. In the non-integrated market structure, when publishers 1 and 2 are symmetric the
search engine implements the user-optimal allocation rule: x̄ = x∗ = 1/2.
Proof. Note from (7), (8), and (10) that symmetry in ri implies that both publishers will choose
the same ad level:
r1 (q0 , ·) = r2 (q0 , ·) ⇒ P1 (q0 , ·) = P2 (q0 , ·) ⇒ q1N I = q2N I .
15
Observers have, for example, accused search engines of systemativally biasing their results in Wikipedia’s favor
in the knowledge that the latter will (for exogenous reasons) show no advertisements.

18

Alexandre de Cornière and Greg Taylor

Therefore we have ∂r1 (q0 , q1N I )/∂q0 = ∂r2 (q0 , q2N I )/∂q0 , so that the second term in (11) is zero.
Equation (11) reduces to dF (ρ − ∆e )/dx̄ = 0 so that x̄ = x∗ (Q). If δ1 (q0 , ·) = δ2 (q0 , ·) and q1 = q2 ,
then

dF (ρ−∆e )
dx̄

= f (ρ − ∆e )ρ� (x̄), which equals zero when x̄ = 1/2.

In the unintegrated case, the incentive for bias comes from the search engine’s desire to relax
competition in the advertising market by directing consumers to the site which represents less of
a competitive threat. Corollary 1 holds because symmetry ensures that neither site is less of a
threat then the other.
Similarly, in the special case that ad demands are independent across the search engine and
publishers, the IIB eﬀect has no bite and the unintegrated search engine’s problem collapses to
maximization of its quality. Again, the result is that the search engine will implement zero bias:
Corollary 2. If ad demands are independent (if (3) holds with equality) then, in the non-integrated
market structure, the search engine implements the user-optimal allocation rule, x̄ = x∗ , and there
is no bias.
Proof. From (4), if ad demands are independent then ∂r1 (q0 , q1N I )/∂q0 = ∂r2 (q0 , q2N I )/∂q0 = 0—
implying that the last term of (11) (the IIB eﬀect) can be neglected. Equation 11 thus reduces to
dF (ρ − ∆e )/dx̄ = 0 so that the search engine’s FOC demands x̄ = x∗ (Q).

5.1

Integration
Partial integration without control

Before analysing the case of full integration, it is interesting to consider the intermediate arrangement whereby publisher 1 shares a fraction φ1 of its revenue with the search engine but retains
full-autonomy—a case we refer to as partial integration, and denote with a P superscript.16 The
partial integration model is practically relevant for two reasons: firstly, Google is already vertically
integrated into the ad platform industry and sells ad technology services to otherwise independent
publishers through subsiduaries such as DoubleClick.17 Thus, the search engine is able to appro16
On a related note, Salop and O’Brien (2000) discuss partial ownership and show that it can either exacerbate
or mitigate the price eﬀects of integration depending on the level of corporate control involved, whilst Gans and
Wolak (2012) provide an analysis in the context of the Australian electricity market.
17
DoubleClick provides technology to aid publishers in determining which ad(s) to impress on each user, but
leaves the publishers in control of their supply of ad inventory. We abstract from the eﬃciency eﬀects of such
technology.

priate a share of advertising revenues generated on such publishers. Secondly, even if the search
engine and publisher 1 are formally-integrated, it may be the case that the internal structure of the
business is such that the publisher is independently managed and thus retains a degree of autonomy in setting q1 —an arrangement that can be represented by φ1 → 1 in this partial integration
model.
Site 1’s profit then becomes π1 = (1 − φ1 )F (ρ − ∆e )x̄q1 P1 . Since φ1 enters as a multiplicative

constant, the first order condition is unchanged and hence q1P = qiN I .18 Note that this also implies
that x∗ is invariant to φ1 : consumers’ preferences over publishers are not aﬀected by partial
integration. The search engine’s profits are now
π0P = F (ρ − ∆e ) [q0 P0 + φ1 x̄q1 P1 ] ,
so its first order condition is

Setting φ1 = 0 corresponds to the unintegrated case considered above. Relative to that case, we
see in the first term that the search engine now cares more about the number of users it attracts
because each user is associated with an additional revenue stream (this corresponds to an Increased
Return to Quality (IRQ)). All else equal, this eﬀect will compel the search engine to implement
higher quality (less biased) results the higher is its revenue share from the content-bearing site.
There is also a second eﬀect: that the search engine has a Direct Incentive to Bias its results in
favour of site 1 (term DIB).
In order to determine whether partial integration increases or alleviates search engine bias, we
need to study two cases separately.
Case 1: In the first case, x̄N I > x∗ . In other words, the unintegrated search engine is biased
towards publisher 1. It is clear that partial integration cannot then lead the search engine to set
x̄P < x∗ , since a deviation to x̄P = x∗ would increase both the number of users and the per-user
revenue. Therefore, partial integration will lead to less bias if x̄P < x̄N I , and to more bias if
18
If φ1 was a per-unit tax on advertising imposed by the search engine, this equality would no longer hold.
Instead, publisher 1 would reduce its supply of advertising space compared to the NI case, which would make it
more attractive to users. We discuss this eﬀect in section 5.2, although it occurs for diﬀerent reasons there.

x̄P > x̄N I .
In the unintegrated case, the optimal allocation rule is characterised by ∂π0 /∂ x̄ = 0. Standard
comparative statics then imply that a suﬃcient condition for partial integration to reduce x̄ (and
hence bias) is ∂ 2 π0 /∂ x̄∂φ1 < 0. Similarly, bias will increase in this case if profits are supermodular,
viz. if ∂ 2 π0 /∂ x̄∂φ1 > 0. Moreover, from (13), we know that

)/x̄
where ηx̄ ≡ − ∂FF (ρ−∆
is the elasticity of user participation with respect to the results quality.
(ρ−∆e )/∂ x̄

Conversely, having ηx̄ > 1 implies that bias will decrease with partial integration.
Case 2: The second case is that in which the non-integrated search engine is biased against
publisher 1 ( when x̄N I < x∗ or, equivalently,

∂P0
∂ x̄

< 0). Partial integration then necessarily leads

to more traﬃc directed to publisher 1 (to an increase in x̄). However, at least some of this shift in
site 1’s favor works to undo the preexisiting bias. Whether the net result is an increase or decrease
in the overall level of bias therefore depends upon the magnitude of the shift. Since the IRQ term
in (13) always works to reduce bias, a suﬃcient condition for bias to decrease is that the second

+ φ1 q1 P1 |, i.e
∂ x̄
∂ x̄

φ1 < φ∗ ≡ −2

.
q1 P1 ∂ x̄

In particular, this implies that (provided x̄N I < x∗ ) bias can always be reduced relative to the no
integration case by implementing some positive degree of partial integration.
The discussion of these two cases is summarized in the following proposition.
Proposition 2. When the search engine and publisher 1 are partially integrated,
1. if x̄N I > x∗ and ηx̄ > 1, the level of bias decreases,
2. if x̄N I > x∗ and ηx̄ < 1, the level of bias increases,
3. if x̄N I < x∗ and φ1 < φ∗ , the level of bias decreases.
Notice that point 3 follows a diﬀerent logic from point 1. In point 3, the search engine is
initially biased against publisher 1; partial integration causes the search engine to direct more
traﬃc to site 1 (to increase x̄), but this serves to oﬀset the preexisting bias so that the overall

Integration and Search Engine Bias

21

level of bias falls. In contrast, partial integration leads the search engine to allocate less traﬃc
to publisher 1 in point 1. This is because demand is highly elastic with respect to quality and
each extra user attracted to the search engine through a higher quality is now associated with an
additional revenue stream. The search engine thus finds it worthwhile to reduce bias, even though
this means directing consumers away from a site in which it has a financial interest.
If the search engine were to receive a share of both publishers’ revenues (with the share from
2 being denoted φ2 ) then the above logic extends in a natural way: (13) becomes

Relative to the case with φ2 = 0, we see, firstly, that the increased returns to quality eﬀect becomes
stornger because the search engine now has two additional sources of per-user revenue rather than
one—and therefore an even stronger incentive to attract additional users. Secondly, the search
engine now has a direct incentive to bias only to the extent that one of the sites yields to it a
higher per-user flow of revenues than does the other. If the per-user revenues that the search
engine receives from the two sites are roughly equal then the direct incentive to bias will be small.
Only the IRQ eﬀect remains significant in such instances and partial integration cannot then cause
bias to increase.

5.2

Full integration

Suppose, now, that the search engine is integrated with publisher 1—a case we denote with an
I superscript. This corresponds to setting φ1 = 1 and allowing the search engine to determine
q1 . Notice that such integration has both vertical and horizontal features. To the extent that the
search engine provides publishers with inputs (eyeballs) that can be sold to advertisers, one may
be tempted to speak about vertical integration. However, the particular structure of the online
advertising market is such that the search engine: (i) does not receive payments from publishers
(these are organic results) and (ii) directly competes with them when it comes to selling eyeballs
to advertisers, both points being more characteristic of horizontal integration.

CPE

The standard logic of horizontal mergers applies in this case. Because publisher 1 now internalizes
the eﬀect of its advertising strategy on the price of the search engine’s sponsored links (the CrossPrice Eﬀect, CPE), it will choose a smaller q1 than in the non-integrated case (equation (10)). On
the other hand, publisher 2 does not internalize the profit of the search engine, and therefore its
advertising level remains unchanged.
Proposition 3. Integration between the search engine and publisher 1 leads to a decrease in the
quantity of ads displayed by publisher 1: q1I ≤ q1N I . Publisher 2 oﬀers the same quantity of ads
under both regimes: q2I = q2N I .19

For example, under the specification of Example 1, it is straightforward to establish from (10)
and (15) that the ad quantities are20

Ignoring—for now—the changes in the allocation rule x̄, we can make two remarks on the
eﬀects of integration. First, integration alleviates the negative externality that advertisers exert
on users, by restricting the supply of advertising space. Notice that this eﬀect is only driven by the
19
The fact that advertising levels go down after integration depends on our assumption of linear pricing. In a
diﬀerent game in which publishers could choose T and p in a two part tariﬀ T + pQ, they would always set p = 0
irrespective of whether there is integration, so that the quantity of ads would remain the same even after integration.
For more on this “neutrality” result with non-linear pricing schemes, see Ambrus, Calvano, and Reisinger (2012).
In our view, the linear pricing assumption fits well how advertisements are sold online.
20
In this simple example, (15) becomes x̄ (α1 − 2β1 q1 − γ1 q0 ) − γ1 x̄q0 = 0 so that q1I , like qiN I , does not depend
on x̄.

23

improved market power of the integrated structure with respect to advertisers, and has nothing to
do with a desire to attract more users through a decrease in q1 , which could be possible only if q1
were ex-ante observable.
Second, the asymmetric reaction of the two publishers following integration changes the relative
preferences of the users who were indiﬀerent between the two, or who slightly preferred publisher
2 before integration. Indeed, in light of Lemma 1, an immediate corollary to Proposition 3 is the
following:
Corollary 3. Following integration, publisher 1 becomes relatively more attractive to users: x∗ (QI ) ≥
x∗ (QN I ).

Anticipating the next subsection, this observation implies that even if integration leads to
an increase in the traﬃc to publisher 1 (an increase in x̄), such an increase is not necessarily
detrimental to users since they now enjoy fewer ads on the publisher they visit. Thus a search
engine that directs more traﬃc to its own content (increases x̄) need not be viewed as biased per
se.
Another corollary of Proposition 3 is the following:
Corollary 4. For advertisers to benefit from integration, it is necessary, but not suﬃcient, that
consumers also benefit from it.
Indeed, the fall in ad volumes following integration (Proposition 3) implies that ad prices must
rise and per-user advertiser revenue must fall. Advertiser profits can therefore only increase if the
number of users increases.
5.2.2

Eﬀects of integration on the allocation of traﬃc

The eﬀect of integration on the search engine’s decision of how to allocate traﬃc somewhat parallels
the partial integration case. In particular, the FOC can be found from (13) by setting φ1 = 1 (and
recalling that integration will result in a fall in q1 ). Thus, as in the partial integration model, the
first term in (13) reflects the additional weight that the search engine puts on attracting users
with high quality results—an eﬀect that unambiguously acts to reduce bias post-integration. In
particular, we again have that
Proposition 4. Integration may lead to a reduction in bias, |x∗ − x̄|.

Figure 2: Plot of the changes in the absolute level of bias, b, after integration relative to the
non-integrated case. The figure is plotted for the specification of Example 1 with αi = βi = 1, δi =
t = q0 = 1/4, and φ1 = 1. The solid black lines trace the loci of points along which full integration
does not cause a change in bias (bI = bN I ); the dashed lines serve a similar purpose for partial
integration (bP = bN I ).
As an illustration of this result, Figure 2 represents the change in bias implied by integration, under the specification of Example 1 for a particular parameterisation. Relative to the
no-integration benchmark, we see that the integrated search engine provides less biased results for
suﬃcient asymmetry in publishers’ ad substitutability with the search engine. In this example,
when γ1 � γ2 , the unintegrated search engine heavily biases its results in favor of site 2 in order
to soften advertising market competition. Integrating with site 1 provides an obvious incentive to
undo this bias with the result that the overall level of bias falls. If, on the other hand, γ1 � γ2
then the unintegrated search engine is already heavily biased in favor of site 1 so that it has little
to gain from further increases in x̄. That x∗ increases after integration then implies that the overall
level of bias falls.
Since Figure 2 is plotted for φ1 = 1 we can interpret the diﬀerence between the full and partial
integration cases shown there as representing the incremental eﬀect of allowing the search engine
to choose q1 .
To gain further insight, let us again restrict our attention to a symmetric setting (see Definition
4). Recall that, from Corollary 1, symmetry implies that there is no bias in the non-integrated

case. This is no longer the case with integration, as is suggested by figure 2:

Lemma 2. When publishers 1 and 2 are symmetric, integration leads the search engine to bias its
results in favor of publisher 1: x̄I > x∗ (QI ) ≥ x∗ (QN I ) = x̄N I = 1/2.
Proof. The last two equalities follow from Corollary 1, and the second inequality is given by
Corollary 3. The only inequality that remains to be proven is the first one. To do so, take the
first-order condition (13) evaluated at x∗ (QI ). By definition,

We see that the symmetry assumption is useful, because the trade-oﬀ induced by integration is
then clear: under symmetry, integration between the search engine and a publisher leads to biased
results in favor of this publisher, but also to a lower level of advertising, which benefits users.
In the next section, we try to draw policy implications from the previous analysis.

Policy implications

Although the intuitive incentive to introduce own-content bias following integration is present in
the model, our analysis underlines two new eﬀects that might oﬀset or mitigate it. The first one
is the increased return to attracting an extra user (the Increased Return to Quality term in (13)),
which can lead to better quality results if bias initially exists, and otherwise softens the incentive
to introduce bias. The second one is the reduction in the advertising distraction incurred by
users (the Cross-Price Eﬀect in (15)). The magnitude of these eﬀects is of course an empirical
matter, outside the scope of this paper. However, the model may oﬀer some guidance regarding
the circumstances under which diﬀerent eﬀects should prevail. In this section we focus on three
important parameters of the model, namely the substitutability between sponsored links and ads
on the publishers’ websites, consumers’ attitudes towards advertising, and content diﬀerentiation.
Throughout, we assume that publishers are symmetric in order to focus on the main trade-oﬀs
identified above.

6.1

Substitutability between sponsored links and banners

In practice, the extent to which advertisers regard these ads as substitutes is subject to disagreement. Whilst Hahn and Singer (2008) present survey evidence suggesting that sponsored links
and banner ads are indeed substitutes, the FTC found that the relevant market for Google was
the search advertising market, thereby implying that display ads showed on the various publishers
are not substitutes to the sponsored links on search engines’ results pages (FTC, 2007). Our view
is that substitutability most likely diﬀers across segments. It is probably rather strong between
general and vertical search engines, which both display sponsored links related to a given query,
and weak between a general search engine and a publisher whose content and design are more
amenable to brand advertising.
The degree of substitutability is an important parameter for two key reasons. First, from a
practical point of view, the extent to which advertisers view search engines and other publishers
as substitutes will help to determine the relevant market, a necessary step should the European
Commission or another competition authority decide to sue Google for abuse of dominant position.
Secondly, in the integrated case, the degree of substitutability will aﬀect the magnitude of the
change in ad levels. Consider the first-order condition (15). It is clear that the change in q1 with
respect to the non-integrated case will be more important when substitutability is high (when
∂P0 /∂q1 is large and negative). In the extreme case of independence (which implies

∂P0
∂q1

= 0), the

last term of (15) disappears and one cannot expect that users would benefit from an improved
surfing experience due to fewer ads after integration. In the case of independence it is also clear,
from equation (13), that the search engine’s new incentives will lead it to be biased in favor of
publisher 1 (recall from Corollary 2 that there is no bias in the unintegrated market when ad
demands are independent). Since relevance decreases and ad volumes do not change, users are
made worse-oﬀ by integration. This causes them to reduce their usage of the search engine, which,
along with the increase in ad prices, makes advertisers worse-oﬀ. This analysis is summarized
below:
Proposition 5. Under symmetry, when there is no ad substitutability between the search engine
and the publishers, integration reduces consumers’ and advertisers’ surplus.
We emphasize that the above result implies that, under symmetry, some degree of substitutability between display and search ads (so that (3) holds as a strict inequality) is a necessary

but, as we shall see, not suﬃcient condition for either advertisers or consumers to benefit from
integration. With imperfect substitutability, the results are a priori more ambiguous, since users
benefit from fewer ads but may suﬀer from biased results. In order to gain further intuition we
invoke the linear Cournot-Hotelling model introduced in Example 1, with consumer search costs
uniformly distributed on [0, 1] so that F (ρ − ∆e ) = U (ρ, ∆). With this specification, equilibrium

ad quantities are as given in (16), x̄N I = 1/2 (by Corollary 1), and x̄I can be straightforwardly
calculated according to (13).
Figure 3 shows how the size of the user base (or, equivalently, the expected utility of a user) is
aﬀected by integration. Integration is more likely to be beneficial if γ is large: making search engine
and publisher ads closer substitutes (increasing γ) increases the size of the competitive externality
that the search engine and publisher 1 exert on each other. It follows that, when these two firms
integrate, the incentive to cut quantity will be strongest when γ is large, so that consumers can
then expect to benefit from a larger fall in ad volumes. Since a necessary condition for such a fall
to be beneficial is that consumers dislike ads, the eﬀect of changes γ is most strongly felt when δ
is large.

As corollary 4 indicates, we see in Figure 3 that the requirement that integration increase social

welfare (W = U + π0 + π1 + π2 + πa ) is more demanding than is the requirement that user surplus
increase.

6.2

Consumers’ attitude towards advertising

Figure 3 also shows how, all else equal, increasing the nuisance cost of advertisements makes
integration more attractive for users and more beneficial for society at large. Intuitively, we know
that ad volumes fall after integration and consumers benefit more from this fall when δ is large.
In all our analysis so far, advertising has been regarded as a pure nuisance for users. That is, a
user’s potential surplus from trade with advertisers is more than oﬀset by the distortion entailed
by advertising. However, although the “pure nuisance” assumption is standard in the literature
(see, for example, Anderson and Coate, 2005), it may be ill-suited to study some situations. In
practice, for a number of services, users may derive utility from the presence of advertisers. This
is the case for instance if the publishers are business directories, used by consumers to find local
shops. Examples include yellow pages or map services. It turns out that our analysis is amenable
to positive externalities from advertising—that is, to the assumption that δi (.) is non-increasing
in qj for every i, j.
In this case, if we assume symmetry between publishers, the eﬀects of integration are rather
unambiguous. Integration leads to results that are more biased and to lower levels of advertising.
Both eﬀects leave users strictly worse-oﬀ and, because the drop in per-user advertisers’ surplus is
accompanied by a decrease in user participation, advertisers also lose from integration.
Proposition 6. Under symmetry, and when advertising exerts a positive externality on users, both
consumer and advertiser surplus go down after integration.

6.3

Content diﬀerentiation

Content diﬀerentiation between publishers 1 and 2 is also an important determinant of the desirability of integration. To see this clearly, suppose that both publishers are identical in the sense
that they are not only symmetric, but also oﬀer the same or equivalent content so that consumers
are ex post indiﬀerent across sites’ content.21 Sites for which this is likely to be a good fit include
21
Note that this does not render the search engine useless because consumers may not know the content sites’
addresses and still rely on the search engine as a tool to navigate to one of the sites over which they are indiﬀerent.

pure information services such as financial data providers, weather services, or directions providers.
Formally, we represent this indiﬀerence by ρ� (x̄) = 0 for every x̄. Given that consumers are indifferent between the two publishers, integration will lead to a complete foreclosure of publisher 2,
that is x̄ = 1. Since the advertising level is lower on publisher 1 after integration (Proposition 3),
consumers strictly benefit from it.
Proposition 7. When publishers 1 and 2 are symmetric and oﬀer undiﬀerentiated content, integration leads to the complete foreclosure of publisher 2 (x̄I = 1), and users are strictly better-oﬀ
than in the non-integrated case.
Proof. Symmetry along with Proposition 3 implies that q1I < q2I = qiN I . Two properties follow:
(i) all consumers prefer site 1 under integration in equilibrium so that dF (ρ − ∆e )/dx̄ > 0, and
(ii) ∂P0 /∂ x̄ > 0. From (13) (with φ1 = 1) it is clear that the integrated firm’s profit is increasing
in x̄:

so that x̄ = 1 in equilibrium. The eﬀect of integration on user utility is U (ρ(1), ∆(QI )) −
U (ρ(x̄N I ), ∆(x̄, QN I )), which is positive since ρ(1) = ρ(x̄N I ) and ∆(x̄, QN I ) > ∆(x̄, QI ).

The fall in ad supply implies that advertisers’ per-user profit goes down with integration, but
this eﬀect may be compensated by the increase in the total number of users.
More generally, as the degree of content diﬀerentiation goes up, two opposite forces are at
play: on the one hand, for a given level of bias, consumers expect a larger drop in utility from
the increase in bias. On the other hand, the increased return to quality (IRQ) eﬀect identified in
(13) induces the integrated search engine to reduce its bias as diﬀerentiation increases (because
consumers care more about being sent to the right site when sites are highly diﬀerentiated, making
participation more sensitive to result quality). Whether integration is more beneficial as content
becomes more diﬀerentiated is thus ambiguous in general. Figure 4 shows that, in the context of
Example 1, the IRQ eﬀect dominates for larger values of t.

Conclusion

The central importance of search engines has made them the focus of recent antitrust scrutiny,
with particular attention being paid to the issue of own-content bias. In this paper we develop
a theoretical model in which a search engine allocates user traﬃc among two publishers whilst
competing with them to attract advertisers. We compare several market structures: independence
of publishers as well as partial and full integration between one publisher and the search engine.
Our model delivers several insights. Firstly, we show that, even when the search engine does
not have a financial interest in either publisher, it has, in general, indirect monetary incentives
to favor publishers that exert the least competitive pressure in the advertising market. These are
the ones that display few ads, or whose ads are not regarded as close substitutes to search engine
sponsored links by advertisers.
Secondly, when the search engine integrates with some publisher, there exist direct monetary
incentives for the search engine to channel traﬃc towards its own-content. We show, however, that
there are several reasons why the level of bias in the results need not increase: (i) the new, own-

Integration and Search Engine Bias

31

content bias may oﬀset the initial, advertising-related bias; (ii) by increasing the expected per-user
revenue of the search engine, integration increases the incentive to provide high-quality search
results, which further disciplines the search engine; (iii) the integrated publisher has an incentive
to lower its supply of advertising space, which benefits users and justifies making this website more
prominent. Indeed, when bias is defined as a deviation from the user surplus-maximizing results,
the no-bias benchmark will typically have a majority of users directed towards the integrated
publisher.
The above remarks notwithstanding, search engines’ and users’ interests are not perfectly
aligned: search engines’ natural incentive to favor own-content sites will often result in bias even
after consumers’ preferences are fully accounted for. In this respect, our contribution has been to
explore the kinds of conditions that are most conducive to welfare-improving integration. Users
are most likely to benefit from integration when the integrated content site and search engine
are close substitutes in the advertising market, provided users have a strong enough aversion to
advertisements, in which case any change in search result quality is likely to be dominated by the
equilibrium fall in ad volumes that follows integration. A similar point holds for the case in which
content sites are largely homogeneous: if users are indiﬀerent between publishers then they are
relatively unaﬀected by bias and the most important eﬀects are those favorable ones taking place
in the ad market. However, when consumers benefit from advertising, integration is more likely
to harm them. Advertisers typically fare worse than consumers after integration because integration leads to an increase in ad prices and a fall in ad volumes. The requirement that integration
improves overall social welfare is therefore generally more demanding.
Our paper, of course, does not tell the whole story. In particular, we have left aside considerations of eﬃciency gains as well as dynamic aspects of the situation. On the first point, advocates
of integration between Google and publishers argue that it will improve the user experience, by
making results more easily accessible.22 One should also take into account that major search engines, and Google in particular, have developed very eﬃcient tools to serve ads, which may justify
integration, independently of our present arguments.
Regarding dynamic aspects, one needs to take into account future incentives to invest in quality.
There are at least two dimensions worth looking into. The first one concerns the search engine’s

incentives to invest in order to improve its algorithm. While we ignore such investments in this
paper, the argument according to which integration may lead to less bias through the increased
return on attracting extra users can also be applied to quality dimensions that are unrelated to
bias. The other dimension to consider is that of the publishers’ incentives to produce high-quality
content. Following integration, will a higher market share boost the marginal incentive to invest
in content production, or will it lead the integrated publisher to rest on its laurels?
More generally, we have focused on the private consumer welfare implications of bias, but in
some instances there may be a broader social interest in the eﬃcacy of search, owing to externalities
in the information consumption process. One obvious example is the consumption of political
information, where society at large may wish a search engine to deliver clear and unfiltered access
to information even when consumers do not. In such instances the appropriate bias-free benchmark
is likely to diﬀer to that discussed here. This and other open questions are left for future research.

Microfoundations for advertisers’ revenue

In section 2.2, we assume that advertisers’ revenue takes the form
r0 (q0 ) + x̄r1 (q0 , q1 ) + (1 − x̄)r2 (q0 , q2 ).

Such an expression is consistent with at least two models describing the interaction between advertisers and consumers:
1. The first model is one in which there is a representative advertiser who wishes to reach
consumers several times. More specifically, assume that showing q ads to a consumer is
worth S(q), S being increasing, concave and such that S(0) = 0. For a vector (q0 , q1 , q2 ) of
ad quantities, a consumer such that x < x̄ is thus worth S(q0 + q1 ), while consumers such
that x > x̄ are worth S(q0 + q2 ). Therefore, the expected revenue generated by a search
engine user is
S(q0 ) +x̄ (S(q0 + q1 ) − S(q0 )) +(1 − x̄) (S(q0 + q2 ) − S(q0 )) .

One easily checks that r0 (0) = r1 (q0 , 0) = r2 (q0 , 0) = 0 and that

2. In the second model, there is a continuum of advertisers who wish to reach consumers only
once. When a consumer sees the ad of a firm, that firm’s expected profit is s. Assume that s
is heterogenous in the population, distributed according to a cdf H. Assume also that there
is a centralized market for advertising space. When a user enters a query x < x̄, the supply
of advertising space is q0 + q1 . For any price p1 , the demand for advertising space equals the
mass of firms with s ≥ p1 , i.e 1 − H(p1 ). The market-clearing price p1 for an impression to a
consumer with x ≤ x̄ is thus such that 1 − H(p1 ) = q0 + q1 , i.e p1 = H −1 (1 − q0 − q1 ). The

total revenue of advertisers is given by the expected profit of the advertisers who buy a slot.

to the one developped in the main text.
Another assumption that we make is that the value of a consumer to advertisers is independent

of his position x. If we consider the second model above, this assumption can be justified if we
assume that each advertiser a has a willingness to pay equal to sa (x) (instead of sa ). We also
need to assume that the centralized advertising market is such that firms are allowed to condition
their demands for ad space on the position of the consumer, which corresponds to a situation of
targeted advertising. If, for every x, the number of firms with sa (x) ≤ p is H(p) and does not
depend on x, then our results carry through.

B

Endogeneity and observability of q0 and x.

One of the main lessons of the paper is that consumers can be made better-oﬀ by integration,
despite an increase in bias, thanks to the lower level of ads to which they are exposed. Assuming
that q0 is fixed allowed us to show this clearly, since only q1 was aﬀected by integration. Moreover,
such an assumption also allowed us to focus on the allocation rule as the only strategic variable of
the search engine.
If we relax the assumption and make q0 endogenous, such a result is much harder to obtain.
Indeed, the change in q0 will also have an eﬀect on q2 , so that the three variables change in a priori
ambiguous directions.
We are led to consider two cases in turn, depending on whether q0 is observed by consumers
prior to their participation decision. Suppose first that q0 , like q1 and q2 , is not observed by
consumers. In the linear case (Example 1), we can show that integration decreases the expected
number of ads that each user will be exposed to.
Proposition 8. Suppose that the model specification is that of Example 1, with symmetry between
publishers 1 and 2. Then the expected number of ads seen by a user goes down.
Proof. In the non integrated case, q0 maximizes q0 P0 = q0 (α − βq0 − γ(xq1 + (1 − x)q2 )), and
q1 and q2 maximize qi (α − βqi − γq0 ). The solution to the system of first-order conditions is then
q0N I = q1N I = q2N I =

α
,
2β+γ

for a total number of ads seen by a user mN I ≡

2α
2β+γ

In the integrated case, q0 and q1 are chosen so as to maximize q0 P0 + x̄q1 P1 = q0 (α − βq0 −
γ(x̄q1 + (1 − x̄)q2 )) + x̄q1 (α − βq1 − γq0 ), while q2 still maximizes q2 (α − βq2 − γq0 ). This gives us

a vector (q0I (x̄), q1I (x̄), q2I (x̄)):
q0I (x) =

The expected number of ads showed to a user will then be mI (x) ≡ q0I (x) + x̄q1I (x̄) + (1 − x̄)q2I (x̄).
It is then straightforward to show that mN I − mI (x̄) is a decreasing function of x̄. At x̄ = 1, it

is of the same sign as β − γ, i.e positive. Thus, for every x̄, mN I > mI (x̄). This is true in particular
for x̄ = x̄I .

On the other hand, suppose that q0 is observed along with x̄. Then the optimal choice of
q0 must solve the trade-oﬀ between achieving a high per-user revenue (i.e maximizing q0 P0 ) and
attracting many users (maximizing F (ρ − ∆e )). The first-order condition, in the non-integrated
case, is

It is diﬃcult to obtain general, tractable results for the endogenous and observable q0 case, but
equilibria can easily be computed and exhibit the same basic properties observed in the baseline
model presented above. Consider, for instance, Example 1 in the symmetric case with α = β = t =
1 and F uniform on [0, 1]. Figure 5 then shows the eﬀect of integration upon advertising volumes.
The total volume of ads seen by those consumers visiting either site falls with integration, which
implies that integration results in every consumer seeing fewer ads in total.
It is interesting to look at the decomposition of ads amongst the integrated firm’s portfolio of
sites. The quantity of ads shown on the search engine itself falls (Figure 5(c)) as the firm seeks
to alleviate the competitive externality implied by substitutability of advertisements. As in the
baseline case, this eﬀect is strongest when ads are close substitutes (when γ is large). One might
expect the same to be true of ads on the integrated publisher. However, in this case there is
another, countervailing consideration. Intuitively, the integrated firm has an incentive to move its
supply of ads away from the search engine to the publisher—where the increase in ad volume is

not observed by consumers.23 When the ad nuisance cost is suﬃciently high, the possibility of
such a deception is so tempting that q1 increases in spite of the competitive externality.
Although ad levels on site 1 may increase, the oﬀsetting eﬀect of substitutability ensures that
they fall relative to those at site 2. Indeed, this can easily be seen analytically from the first order
conditions of the publishers: for a given choice of q0 , site 2 solves (10), whereas the integrated
firm must set q1 to solve (15). Since the CPE term in (15) is negative, and since q1N I = q2N I under
symmetry, we have
Proposition 9. Under symmetry, integration causes site 1’s ad volume to fall relative to that of
site 2 so that q1I < q2I .
Thus, by Lemma 1, site 1 becomes relatively more attractive to consumers after integration.
This manifests as an increase in the user-optimal allocation rule, x∗ . Although it is therefore
in consumers’ interest that additional traﬃc be directed to the integrated publisher, integration
creates a suﬃciently strong incentive for own-content bias to ensure that the integrated search
engine favors its own site too much. The scale of the ensuing bias is shown in Figure 6 (it is easily
verified that Lemma 2 carries over to the endogenous q0 case so that pre-integration bias is zero).
Given the above discussion, it is not a priori clear whether or not consumers are harmed by
integration: advertising levels fall, which reduces the advertising nuisance burden, but bias is
introduced into the search results—decreasing the average content consumption utility. Figure 7

Although this behaviour is not observed, q1 is correctly anticipated in equilibrium.

Figure 7: Contour plots of the eﬀect of integration on consumer surplus when consumers observe
q0 . Contours are drawn every 0.015 units and the diﬀerence (U I − U N I ) is increasing in the
direction indicated by the arrow. The bold, solid contour indicates the locus of points along which
integration is consumer surplus neutral. Consumer surplus increases (decreases) with integration

shows the overall eﬀect of integration on consumer surplus (with uniformly distributed search costs,
consumer surplus is equal to the number of users). This mirrors the analysis of the exogenous q0
case in that integration can benefit consumers despite an increase in bias. As one might expect in
light of the above, users most benefit from integration when the ad nuisance is large (since they
then gain relatively more from the fall in ad volumes) and are harmed otherwise.

Observability of the allocation rule. The assumption that x̄ is observed may seem strange
if one takes the model at face value. Indeed, consumers certainly cannot observe the algorithm
used by search engines. Our interpretation of this assumption of the model is, in a broad sense,
that a lower quality of results will eventually drive some users away from the search engine, either
because they hear about it in the media or they experience it themselves.
However, it is legitimate to ask how important this assumption is. It turns out that without
observability of x̄, users would be better-oﬀ after integration, unless possibly if the publishers are
very asymmetric.
To see this, consider first equation (11). Having x̄ unobserved by consumers (but still observed

.

The profit π0N I is therefore an aﬃne function of x̄, so that the search engine will choose either x̄ = 0
or x̄ = 1 (or be indiﬀerent to the value of x̄ when

Unobservability of x̄ thus implies

that the indirect incentives to bias (IIB) are so powerful as to lead to the complete foreclosure of
one of the publishers.
Consider now the integrated case. Whether x̄ is observed by consumers does not aﬀect the fact
that q1 is now lower than without integration. The derivative of the search engine’s profit is now

Therefore we must have x̄I ≥ x̄N I and (x̄I , x̄N I ) ∈ {0; 1}2 . So we have three cases:

1. x̄I = 0, x̄N I = 0,
2. x̄I = 1, x̄N I = 0,
3. x̄I = 1, x̄N I = 1.
In cases 1 and 3, the equilibrium allocation rule is not aﬀected by integration, so that consumers
clearly benefit from integration. In case 2, integration leads to a switch from a situation in which
all users are directed towards publisher 2 with an ad level q2N I = q2I to a situation in which publisher
1 receives all the traﬃc and displays q1I ads. For small levels of asymmetry between publishers 1
and 2, the positive eﬀect of seeing fewer ads will be the dominant eﬀect, and consumers will be
better-oﬀ. The only case in which integration could be bad for consumers would be a situation
in which publisher 1 displays more ads than publisher 2 even after integration, which can only
happen when there is a large asymmetry in terms of the ad-revenue functions r1 and r2 .
