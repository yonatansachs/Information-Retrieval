introduction
an
ongoing
debate
about
search
engine
quality
is
gathering
pace
in
both
academic
journals
and
public
forums
the
debate
is
not
by
any
means
unified
and
often
seems
contradictory
search
engines
have
been
criticized
for
providing
too
much
access
to
information
for
example
by
indexing
sites
promoting
child
pornography
anorexia
or
hate

as
well
as
by
releasing
information
about
their
users
to
governments
or
to
wider
audience

conversely
search
engines
have
been
criticized
for
not
providing
enough
access
to
information
for
example
by
poorly
indexing
dynamic
sites
failing
to
refresh
their
own
index

or
by

rq1
how
do
search
engine
producers
conceive
of
quality
this
work
builds
on
structuration
theory
which
suggests
that
conceptions
of
quality
are
part
of
larger
collective
schemas
that
affect
how
resources
are
allocated
on
larger
scale
thus
the
study
also
asks
rq2
what
are
the
implications
of
these
conceptions
of
quality
for
the
future
development
of
search
engines
the
primary
aim
of
this
article
is
to
articulate
the
unspoken
assumptions
of
search
engine
producers
regarding
their
views
in
the
debate
about
search
engine
quality
the
article
begins
by
articulating
the
concept
of
the
technological
schema
discursive
formation
through
which
technology
is
given
meaning
and
which
is
used
to
mobilize
other
resources
such
as
money
and
labor
the
second
part
of
the
article
discusses
the
schemas
in
evidence
in
series
of
interviews
conducted
with
search
engine
producers
primarily
high-level
engineering
staff
each
of
the
schemas
identified
ascribes
meaning
to
search
engine
technology
in
different
way
using
different
definitions
of
quality
the
third
part
of
the
article
examines
how
the
different
definitions
of
quality
inherent
in
the
technological
schemas
are
used
strategically
by
the
search
engine
producers
to
control
the
development
of
search
engine
technology
finally
the
article
considers
how
these
technological
schemas
constrain
both
the
possible
interpretations
of
quality
and
the
mobilization
of
resources
around
alternate
frameworks
by
which
search
engine
quality
might
be
assessed
theoretical
background
the
key
theoretical
underpinning
of
this
article
is
the
concept
of
structuration
reflexive
social
theory
drawn
from
the
work
of
anthony
giddens
1984
which
proposes
that
people
actions
and
discourses
influence
social
systems
but
are
also

finally
search

have
been
criticized
simply
for
their
lack
of

in

for
the
fact
that
no

really

ongoing
controversies
reflect
lack

consensus
about
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
information
that
search
engines
ought
to
provide

is
an
important
normative
issue
yet
despite
its
importance
it
is
problematic
to
study
empirically
any
measures
that
researcher
might
choose
to
examine
would
of
necessity
be
controversial
by
examining
search
engine
producers

turn
influenced
by
them
from
this
perspective
technology
can
be
seen
to
be
an
element
of
both
system
and
social
action
which
are
interacting
dynamically
several
different
frameworks
and
terminologies
have
been
used
to
describe
this
interaction
including
from
the
science
and
technology
studies
sts
perspective
the
technological
frame
bijker
1995
and
technological
frame
of
reference
orlikowski
gash
1994
and
from
social
and
cultural
theory
interpretative
schemes
giddens
1984
interpretative
repertoires
potter
wetherell
1987
and
schemas
sewell
1992
the
starting
point
for
this
article
is
giddens
interpretive
scheme
which
is
way
of
accounting
for
and
explaining
the
world
according
to
giddens
interpretative
schemes
are
the
modes
of
typification
incorporated
within
actors
stocks
of
knowledge
1984
29
these
interpretative
schemes
help
to
govern
the
allocation
of
resources
and
thereby
reinforce
or
potentially
change
larger
structures
sewell
1992
helpfully
develops
giddens
concepts
by
suggesting
how
culture
functions
to
develop
social
structures
which
giddens
terms
rule-resource
sets
according
to
sewell
1992
while
material
objects
such
as
money
or
buildings
have
an
independent
existence
their
simple
existence
is
not
enough
to
create
value
or
power
for
that
cultural
schemas
are
needed
to
take
one
example
paper
money
has
no
value
without
its
meaning
as
medium
of
exchange
resources
like
money
and
technology
therefore
embody
cultural
schemas
sewell
1992
19
but
not
unambiguously
the
value
of
resource
is
dependent
upon
the
ways
in
which
cultural
schemas
can
mobilize
that
and
other
resources
both
bijker
1995
and
orlikowski
and
gash
1994
acknowledge
debt
to
giddens
in
developing
their
concepts
according
to
bijker
technological
frame
refers
to
the
shared
cognitive
frame
that
defines
relevant
social
group
and
constitutes
members
common
interpretation
of
an
artifact
1995
pp
125
126
similarly
orlikowski
and
gash
argue
that
technological
frame
of
reference
governs
the
way
in
which
people
perceive
technology
as
appropriate
or
inappropriate
thus
their
definition
of
the
technological
frame
of
reference
includes
not
only
the
nature
and
role
of
the
technology
itself
but
the
specific
conditions
application
and
consequences
of
that
technology
in
particular
contexts
1994
178
returning
to
giddens
1984
and
sewell
1992
arguments
about
the
relationship
between
rules
and
resources
therefore
we
might
suggest
that
the
technological
frame
or
technological
frame
of
reference
is
the
way
in
which
producers
cognitively
organize
technology
this
frame
then
not
only
helps
to
interpret
technology
and
give
it
meaning
but
also
aids
the
producers
in
mobilizing
other
resources
around
their
interpretation
viewing
technological
frame
in
this
way
also
allows
us
to
account
for
the
strategic
use
of
different
frames
potter
and
wetherell
1987
argue
that
each
speech
act
is
an
achievement
on
the
part
of
the
speaker
and
that
different
interpretative
repertoires
have
different
functions
for
speakers
and
will
appear
in
different
contexts
for
example

where

talk
about

as
discussed
above
this
article
analyzes
the
technological
schemas
of
search
engine
producers
the
analysis
was
approached
through
series
of
in-depth
interviews
with
search
engine
producers
primarily
senior
engineers
and
technical
executives
involved
with
directing
code
development
see
table
while
not
large
the
sample
is
comprehensive
in
that
it
includes
interviews
from
producers
in
all
the
major
search

companies
and
some

or
had
worked
for

including

lycos
infoseek
and

among
others
these
producers
can
be
characterized
as
elite
interviewees
the
period
of
data
collection
was
thus
quite
long
between
november
2002
and
may
2004
and
each
interview
typically
required
several
contacts
prior
to
the
interview
itself
all
interviewees
requested
anonymity
concern
for
the
security
of
their
jobs
was
acute
for
many
to
protect
their
confidence
interviewees
are
identified
by

only
and
all

are
anonymized

the

began
with

the

science
in
their
investigations
gilbert
and
mulkay
found
two
interpretative
repertoires
which
they
named
the
empiricist
repertoire
and
the
contingent
repertoire
the
empiricist
repertoire
stressed
the
primacy
of
scientific
data
in
accounting
for
the
acceptance
of
one
theory
over
another
while
the
contingent
repertoire
stressed
external
factors
such
as
personal
characteristics
or
political
affiliations
each
repertoire
in
their
study
was
deployed
in
particular
circumstances
for
example
in
formal
journal
submissions
versus
informal
contexts
or
within
the
same
conversation
to
explain
away
contradictions
arising
from
inconsistencies
in
single
repertoire
the
strategic
use
of
interpretative
repertoires
fits
more
closely
with
the
empirical

in

the

this

of

the
results
showed
that
two
major
schemas
structure
the
development
of
search
engine
technology
the
first
have
chosen
to
call
the
market
schema
because
discourse
in
this
schema
refers
mainly
to
business-related
issues
costs
revenues
and
competition
the
second
major
schema
call
the
science-technology
schema
its
discourse
is
dominated
by
experiments
measures
proof
and
utility
minor
schemas
were
also
noted
primarily
war
schema
whose
discourse
was
one
of
enemies
and
combat
although
the
schemas
are
analytically
distinct
in
practice
they
were
not
mutually
exclusive
and
one
of
the
striking
elements
of
the
interviews
is
the
ways
in
which
interviewees
negotiate
among
the
different
schemas
the
market
schema
during
the
interviews
each
interviewee
was
asked
to
describe
time
when
there
was
modification
to
the
search
engine
he
was
working
on
what
the
rationale
for
that
modification
was
and
who
was
involved
in
the
modification
this
was
intended
specifically
to
bring
out
typical
accounts
and
rationales
for
change
and
implicitly
quality
and
the
interviewees
often
described
both
general
processes
and
specific
incidents
the
most
common
description
and
justification
in
all
the
interviews
was
with
reference
to
business
issues
including
competition
revenues
and
costs
my
interviewees
discussed
the
search
engine
as
commercial
service
product
in
marketplace
that
is
highly
competitive
in
the
market
schema
interviewees
related
decisions
to
alter
the
functionality
or
the
display
of
the
search
engine
to
revenues
costs
or
competitive
goals
quality
as
customer
satisfaction
the
market
schema
links
revenue
to
quality
through
the
idea
of
customer
satisfaction
this
makes
sense
when
considering
that
companies
exist
to
create
profit
and
wealth
so
an
increase
in
wealth
is
quality
business
outcome
the
belief
that
more
customers
lead
to
more
revenue
is
unquestioned
and

each
interview
text
was
then
analyzed
to
develop
preliminary
categorization
of
likely
schemas
strong
and
unusual
verbs
and
nouns
with
particular
connotations
were
the
first
indicators
for
example
one
interviewee
said
fought
in
the
search
wars
interviewee
the
use
of
the
verb
fought
and
the
noun
war
indicated
potential
schema
of
conflict
or
war
each
transcript
was
reviewed
in
depth
and
final
determination
of
major
and
minor
schemas
was
made
by
the
author
the
distinction
between
major
and
minor
schemas
was
operationalized
as
involving
both
quantity
major
schemas
were
used
far
more
frequently
and
quality
minor
schemas
were
used
to
frame
shorter
passages
within
the
major
schemas
rather
than
organizing
long
sections
of
discourse
the
quotes
assigned
to
particular
schema
were
then
examined
for
the
ways
in
which
they
answered
the
primary
research
question
how
do
search
engine
producers
conceive
of
search
engine
quality
satisfaction
are
based
on
the
idea
that
satisfied
customers
will
recommend
other
satisfied
customers
leading
to
increased
revenue
whereas
dissatisfied
customers
will
leave
and
tell
their
friends
leading
to
revenue
decrease
as
discussed
above
discourse
that
invokes
the
market
schema
stresses
the
business
rationale
for
changes
an
excellent
example
is
the
following
quote
from
senior
engineer
who
relates
the
way
in
which
changes
to
the
search
engine
are
discussed
and
developed
before
being
implemented
in
this
comment
the
change
is
articulated
within
market
or
business
framework
where
the
strategic
goals
are
leveraging
assets
market
distribution
and
market
share
the
examples
of
motives
that
he
gives
this
is
the
ultimate
goal
according
to
the
interviewee
because
it
leads
to
revenue
in
competitive
environment
despite
the
fact
that
the
discourse
of
the
market
predominated
in
the
interviews
the
interviewees
seemed
generally
hostile
to
interference
from
other
parts
of
the
company
in
the
search
product
and
in
particular
to
the
demands
of
advertising
as
the
quotes
below
illustrate
product
managers
come
up
with
completely
irrelevant
types
of
features
they
want
to
see
implemented
so
for
instance
instead
of
focusing
on
core
technology
they
ask
you
to
put
in
yet
another
link
or
yet
another
space
for
ads
in
the
interface
interviewee
had
to
sacrifice
portion
of
the
homepage
to
promoting
their
stuff
which
was
pathetic
interviewee
was
clear
to
us
that
if
we
started
to
give
too
much
weight
to
the
advertisers
in
terms
of
our
index
we
would
dilute
the
value
of
our
product
interviewee
irrelevant
and
pathetic
it
may
be
but
advertising
is
central
to
the
search
business
van
couvering
2004
and
reduction
in
advertising
means
reduction
in
revenue
nevertheless
in
the
years
leading
up
to
when
these
interviews
took
place
many
companies
decided
to
move
away
from
search
results
that
returned
many
results
from
the
parent
company
or
that
included
hidden
advertisements
some
of
the
interviewees
were
involved
in
arguing
for
these
changes
and
mentioned
their
role
with
pride
they
argued
for
and
secured
reduction
in
advertising
using
quality
argument
based
on
customer
satisfaction
as
their
justification
first
one
interviewee
articulates
the
early
strategy
behind
showing
many
results
from
the
parent
company
on
send
users
our
customers
away
from
the
search
engine
instead
send
them
into
our
portal
so
we
can
help
to
monetize
them
again
and
all
that
good
stuff

well
mean
basically
if
change
is
suggested
there
needs
to
be
some
kind
of
motive
for
it
gives
examples
of
specific
motives
and
these
things
all
drive
towards
market
share
which
of
course
is
the
ultimate
goal
which
leads
to
revenue
etc
interviewee
the
business
rationale
for
advertising
is
clear
keep
the
users
in
the
portal
and
show
them
as
many
ads
as
possible
he
then
goes
on
to
say
why
his
company
no
longer
follows
that
strategy
are
moving
away
from
that
as
policy
because
fundamentally
it
doesn
work
as
it
turns
out
if
the
portal
has
what
you
are
looking
for
you
ll
go
there
you
will
right
if
it
doesn
then
sending
you
there
just
pisses
you
off
and
you
look
like
shill
because
you
are
interviewee
it
was
tough
decision
to
make
because
it
meant
big
revenue
impact
in
the
short
term
but
taking
the
long-term
view
we
knew
that
if
we
didn
do
that
we
probably
have
dissatisfied
customers
who
would
not
want
to
use
our
service
or
not
recommend
it
to
friends
or
maybe
even
switch
to
another
service
so
we
were
sort
of
taking
the
long-term
view
interviewee
the
short-term
revenue
impact
is
justified
by
arguing
for
long-term
revenue
sort
of
as
this
interviewee
says
third
interviewee
continues
in
the
same
vein
by
saying
that
immediate
monetization
controlling
where
people
go
can
be
dangerous
because
the
users
will
stop
you
have
to
be
subtle
in
controlling
where
people
go
you
can
just
only
show
them
your
own
content
you
can
hit
them
over
the
head
but
you
can
certainly
influence
it
tough
right
there
are
editorial
concerns
as
to
where
you
drive
people
but
it
can
obviously
only
be
done
without
affecting
perceived
quality
if
the
user
doesn
think
they
are
getting
the
results
they
want
that
won
fly
so
you
can
stick
inferior
products
on
the
top
of
better
ones
just
because
they
are
your
products
the
users
will
stop
they
will
object
interviewee
these
quotes
suggest
that
quality
is
linked
to
long-term
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
customers
which
in
turn
is
linked
to
revenue
the
positive
goal
or
norm
of
the
market
schema
the
next
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
it
is
the
engineering
production
teams
who
define
search
quality
in
terms
of
relevance
as
is
discussed
in
the
next
section
the
science-technology
schema
the
second
major
schema
identified
the
science-technology
schema
is
characterized
by
discourse
that
includes
experimentation
measurement
and
proof
the
more
scientific
aspect
and
usefulness
feasibility
and
design
qualities
such
as
stateof-the-art
the
more
technological
aspect
the
science
constructed
by
this

by
monetizing
the
customers
in
accordance
with
business
demands
that
is
by
sending
them
to
other
products
so
that
they
can
look
at
more
ads
this
interviewee
argues
that
the
search
engine
will
piss
users
off
and
damage
its
own
reputation
by
appearing
like
shill
or
conman
the
risk
to
customer
satisfaction
is
clear
another
interviewee
takes
up
the
tale
yeah
well
we
re
constantly
making
changes
the
key
thing
to
understand
is
that
search
and
indeed
basically
all
internet
business
is
highly
data-driven
one
of
the
key
components
of
what
we
do
here
is
to
develop
deep
array
of
metrics
with
which
we
measure
what
is
going
on
in
the
service
these
are
quality
metrics
so
lot
of
the
decision-making
is
really
focused
around
observing
deficiencies
in
some
particular
metric
relative
to
where
we
like
to
be
or
relative
to
the
competition
considering
changes
that
would
improve
it
and
often
provedly
improve
it
because
you
can
do
test
and
see
what
is
the
impact
on
the
number
of
hits
and
then
know
what
would
happen
so
lot
of
the
work
that
do
is
meant
to
be
driven
pretty
objectively
and
we
tend
to
do
that
for
most
of
what
we
do
interviewee
here
the
interviewee
gives
as
his
reason
for
making
changes
elements
of
positive
science
measures
observation
proof
and
objectivity
it
should
be
noted
that
the
interviewee
also
speaks
of
measuring
relative
to
the
competition
this
section
will
later
examine
the
relationship
between
the
science-technology
schema
and
the
market
schema
the
next
quote
exemplifies
more
technological
point
of
view
here
the
interviewee
the
founder
of
search
engine
that
was
successful
in
the
late
1990s
is
talking
about
how
he
came
to
develop
the
technology
for
that
search
engine
the
common
thread
is
big
problems
was
working
on
all
sorts
of
interesting
things
one
of
the
things
did
from
the
very
start
was
to
try
to
make
engine
useful
to
everybody
so
that
was
big
effort
making
sure
that
everybody
can
access
it
the
analogy
was
using
at
the
time
was
think
of
it
as
pencil
you
don
want
your
pencil
to
be
some
big
complicated
contraption
that
starts
singing
at
you
every
time
you
pick
it
up
interviewee
the
emphasis
on
big
problems
and
things
that
are
interesting
for
their
own
sake
is
an
element
of
scientific
research
but
when
the
interviewee
also
goes
on
to
talk
about
things
being
useful
accessible
practical
etc
the
discourse
becomes
more
applied
or
technological
than
scientific
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
the
way
in
which
science
and
technology
are
constructed
within
this
discourse
is
quite
specific
the
strong
impression
given
is
that
science
deals
with
measurable
if
complex
facts
that
are
causally
linked
while
the
goal
of
technology
is
to
use
the
knowledge
of
the
causal
links
to
enable
the
user
of
the
technology
to
act
on
the
world
effectively

is
positivist
experimental
science
that
has
objectivity
as
an
essential
norm
technology
is
the
application
of
this
science
to
the
problems
of
search
and
is
focused
on
solutions
and
progress
thus
in
the
science-technology
schema
the
search
engine
is
both
interesting
in
itself
as
research
object
and
as
potential
solution
to
people
needs
the
science-technology
schema
is
exemplified
by
quotes
like
the
one
below
where
the
interviewee
who
is
chief
scientist
for
major
search
engine
describes
the
procedure
for
making
changes
in
their
search
engine
algorithm
efficiently
both
science
and
technology
are
or
should
be
progressing
if
then
if
only
we
can
do
x1
we
should
achieve
y1
as
interviewee
stated
above
changes
to
the
search
engine
in
this
schema
are
meant
to
be
driven
pretty
objectively
the
implication
of
course
is
that
decisions
are
not
always
objective
in
the
next
section
which
discusses
quality
from
the
science-technology
perspective
this
contradiction
is
explored
through
discussion
of
the
concept
of
relevance
relevance
so
relevance
freshness
mean
you
can
almost
lump
everything
under
relevance
but
that
such
big
umbrella
interviewee
what
is
relevance
in
small
well-defined
database
it
is
relatively
easy
to
sort
relevant
from
irrelevant
documents
on
the
web
this
is
not
necessarily
as
simple
one
interviewee
commented
that
the
standard
of
relevance
has
changed
from
when
he
began
to
work
with
information
retrieval
systems
here
the
systems
used
to
only
be
the
dialogues
and
the
lexis-nexises
you
know
think
they
strove
for
more
academic
standard
of
relevance
where
you
define
relevance
as
the
relationship
between
the
subject
that
is
in
the
document
with
what
the
user
is
asking
about
so
it
is
sort
of
topical
relevance
whereas
in
the
practical
world
where
the
search
engines
are
reaching
today
something
being
useful
to
the
user
and
something
where
the
user
grabs
the
information
and
continues
has
become
think
more
important
and
less
emphasis
on
say
getting
the
best
document

quality
as
relevance
as
discussed
above
many
interviewees
equate
search
engine
quality
with
customer
satisfaction
second
major
way
to
discuss
quality
that
relates
to
the
sciencetechnology
schema
is
relevance
the
term
relevance
is
borrowed
into
the
discourse
of
search
engine
producers
from
information
science
where
it
forms
the
bedrock
of
several
traditional
measures
of
information
retrieval
quality
including
for
example
recall
and
precision
recall
in
information
retrieval
refers
to
the
proportion
of
relevant
documents
retrieved
from
the
database
precision
measures
the
proportion
of
retrieved
documents
that
are
relevant
singhal
2001
these
terms
were
developed
for
relatively
small
relatively
high-quality
databases
of
documents
for
example
news
articles
contained
in
lexis-nexis
in
those
cases
users
do
not
want
to
miss
any
relevant
documents
that
is
they
want
their
searches
to
have
high
recall
and
they
do
not
want
to
retrieve
very
many
irrelevant
documents
that
is
they
want
their
searches
to
have
high
precision
metrics
such
as
precision
and
recall
are
still
part
of
quality-testing
search
engines
but
what
is
contested
is
the
underlying
ability
to
categorize
documents
into
relevant
and
irrelevant
discursively
relevance
takes
central
stage
when
interviewees
talk
about
changes
related
to
technical
quality
as
the
senior
vice
president
for
technology
of
major
search
engine
indicated
when
asked
what
motivated
changes
in
his
search
engine
in
other
words
as
this
interviewee
says
elsewhere
it
is
about
satisfying
users
relevance
has
changed
from
some
type
of
topical
relevance
based
on
an
applied
classification
to
something
more
subjective
most
of
the
interviewees
defined
relevant
document
as
document
that
answered
the
user
question
or
was
what
he
or
she
wanted
from
technical
standpoint
then
the
definition
of
quality
search
engine
is
simple
if
the
search
engine
gives
you
results
that
answer
your
question
then
the
search
engine
has
delivered
relevant
response
and
the
results
are
quality
results
the
war
schema
the
war
schema
refers
to
discourse
that
is
characterized
by
talk
of
fighting
guarding
war
defenses
and
the
like
this
schema
is
minor
schema
the
words
or
phrases
that
characterize
it
occur
in
sections
of
the
interviews
that
are
primarily
related
to
the
market
schema
or
the
science-technology
schema
for
example
an
interviewee
will
talk
about
an
arms
race
between
spammers
and
search
engine
producers
will
refer
to
competition
as
tough
battle
etc
nonetheless
military
words
and
expressions
occurred
with
enough
frequency
and
sufficient
clarity
to
warrant
inclusion
as
separate
schema
for
example
one
interviewee
said
characterizing
his
time
developing
search
engines
fought
in
the
search
wars
interviewee
the
war
schema
has
little
to
say
regarding
search
engine
quality
in
contrast
to
the
other
schemas
the
war
schema
is
focused
on
others
particularly
the
enemy
and
by
contrast
the
identity
of
the
speaker
in
this
context
the
enemy
is
twofold
first
the
competition
other
companies
is
characterized
as
the
enemy
re
not
trying
to
beat
engine
and
engine
at
their
game
directly
think
that
very
tough
battle
they
ve
got
lots
of
bright
people
very
well-paid
working
on
this
stuff
and
to
try
to
go
head-to-head
say
on
search
quality
is
very
difficult
thing
interviewee
this
is
fairly
commonplace
usage
battling
other
companies
going
headto-head
etc
the
animosity
implicit
to
the
war
schema
is
quite
impersonal
when
referring
to
these
respected
opponents
however
animosity
towards
the
second
class
of
enemy
the
guerilla
fighters
of
spamming
and
hacking
is
more
direct
here
one
interviewee
describes
them
as
trying
to
get
at
you
there
is
also
an
adversarial
aspect
to
it
in
that
you
have
hackers
and
spammers
trying
to
get
at
you
interviewee
sometimes
the
enemy
can
be
trying
to
get
at
you
by
threatening
your
revenue
and
sometimes
by
threatening
your
technology

questions

relevance
is
when
we
actually
return
something
that
answers

question
interviewee
the
war
schema
is
not
only
important
in
defining
relationships
with
other
actors
it
also
provides
reflection
on
the
identity
of

of

precious

we
considered
it
to

people

it
was
up

make

that
we
gave

possible
interviewee
the
war
schema
is
important
because
it
frames
much
of
the
discussion
about
people
outside
the
search
engine
organization
in
this
schema
the
guardians
of
search
defend
against
the
incursions
of
the
other
whether
those
others
are
honored
competitors
or
fraudulent
spammers
in
summary
therefore
the
search
engine
producers
use
two
primary
technological
schemas
to
ascribe
meaning
to
search
technology
in
the
market
schema
the
search
technology
is
part
of
business
in
the
technology
schema
it
is
piece
of
engineering
work
each
schema
has
concomitant
definition
of
quality
either
customer
satisfaction
or
relevance
the
minor
war
schema
characterizes
search
technology
as
defense
either
against
the
competition
market
schema
or
against
those
who
would
affect
the
results
for
their
own
ends
technology
schema
quality
issues
are
not
specifically
referred
to
but
one
could
draw
the
tentative
inference
that
secrecy
from
the
competition
or
robustness
against
spammers
might
be
indications
of
quality
technological
schemas
are
not
only
method
of
accounting
for
and
explaining
technology
but
also
have
real
consequences
for
development
as
they
function
as
device
to
mobilize
other
resources
such
as
cash
office
space
extra
personnel
etc
which
schema
to
use
at
which
point
to
mobilize
what
resource
is
therefore
strategic
question
for
the
actors
with
ongoing
implications
having
discussed
the
schemas
and
their
definitions
of
quality
the
next

examines
these
implications

of

the
strategic

of
the

investigates
the
ways
in
which

talk
within
this
schema
is
about
beating
the
opponent
or
enemy
in
other
words
decision-making
is
characterized
not
by
any
kind
of
appeal
to
hierarchy
consensus
or
objective
measure
but
rather
by
who
can
win
even
though
several
interviewees
likened
it
to
an
arms
race
in
which
no
one
was
likely
to
come
out
on
top
this
particular
metaphor
the
arms
race
was
not
used
about
competing
with
other
businesses
spammers
were
also
likened
to
criminals
particularly
fraudsters
or
conmen
and
specifically
contrasted
with
honest
people

on
the
recursive
relationship
between
relevance
and
customer
satisfaction
and
the
construction
of
these
two
terms
in

as
to
empower

finally
it
examines
how
these
major
schemas
constrain
the
expression
of
alternative

don
have
lot
of
background
on
that
but
would
imagine
personally
just
observing
the
explosion
of
information
online
partially
comments
from
our
own
customers
and
business
partners
partially
an
observation
of
customer
dissatisfaction
with
our

experience
we
measure
that
on
very
regular
basis
and
we
care
lot
about
what
the

tells

and
we
knew
that
customers
weren

of

the
interviewee
also
describes
the
way
in

the

which
involved
the
whole

he
later
clarifies
that
it
went
the
whole
way
to
the

the

goes
on

don

as
interviewees
discussed
their
work
and
accounted
for
their
actions
they
used
language
which
either
implicitly
or
explicitly
reflected
their
own
senses
of
identity
and
agency
or
their
ability
to
act
when
framing
actions
within
the
market
schema
interviewees
constructed
themselves
as
significantly
constrained
in
marked
contrast
to
the
empowered
constructions
of
the

the
grammatical
structure
of
the
interviews
shows
that
interviewees
overwhelmingly
refer
to
actions
and
descriptions
as
part
of
collective
corporate
we
typically
using
the
pronoun
only
when
discussing
personal
matters
or
when
they
are
unsure
of
the
agreed
corporate
version
for
example
one
interviewee
discussed
what
led
to
the
decision
for
his
company
to
build
their
own
search
technology
instead
of
purchasing
listings
from
third
party
which
had
been
their
previous
strategy
in
the

in
which
the

accounts
for

that

interviewee
quality
control
the
implication
of
the
discussion
of
identity
and
agency
in
the
previous
section
is
that
within
the
dominant
market
schema
interviewees
construct
their
ability
to
act
as
significantly
constrained
whereas
within
the
science-technology
schema
they
are
rhetorically
empowered
strategically
then
it
is
of
benefit
to
these
producers
to
be
able
to
use
the
science-technology
quality
construction
of
relevance
they
do
this
first
by
constructing
rhetorical
customer
who
does
not
correspond
to
the
actual
customer
this
rhetorical
customer
is
satisfied
through
greater
relevance
unlike
the
actual
customer
second
the
slippery
subjective
concept
of
relevance
is
quantified
reified
and
discussed
in
highly
technical
language
which
makes
it
unavailable
to
other
actors
the
rhetorical
customer
the
term
customer
ordinarily
refers
to
someone
who
buys
products
from
company
in
that
sense
greater
customer
satisfaction
would
in
most
cases
lead
to
larger
or
more
frequent
purchases
and
positively
impact
the
revenue
of
the
company
in
the
discourse
of
search
engine
producers
however
customers
are
equated
with
users
users
the
people
who
type
in
queries
and
click
on
results
are
not
customers
of
search
engines
in
an
ordinary
sense
because
they
do
not
purchase
products
from
search
engine
companies
in
fact
the
customers
of
search
engines
in
the
ordinary
sense
are
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
businesses
that
purchase
advertising
and
other
services
the
rhetorical
customer
user
serves
the
function
of
creating
customer
satisfaction
through
greater
relevance
and
thus
making
relevance
key
benchmark
of
quality
in
the
market
schema
as
well
as
the
science-technology
schema
none
of
the
interviewees
mentioned
changing
the
search
engine
to
make
it
friendlier
to
advertisers
and
indeed
many
were
openly
hostile
to
advertising

in
this
quote
the
interviewee
identifies
specifically
as
an
engineer
and
very
emotionally
expresses
why
he
belongs
because
engineers
fix
things
so
that
our
collective
experience
can
be
greater
it
was
notable
during
the
interviews
that
while
the
market
schema
is
more
pervasive
the
interviewees
were
most
animated
and
excited
when
expressing
themselves
using
the
language
of
the
science-technology
schema
their
voices
rose
with
excitement
they
spoke
more
quickly
they
engaged
more
with
the
interviewer
and
they
almost
took
on
the
role
of
educator
in
short
they
seemed
to
be
more
comfortable
with
this
way
of
expressing
themselves
and
seemed
to
identify
more
emotionally
with
this
schema
in
the
language
of
science-technology
they
spoke
as
experts
fully
comfortable
with
their
agency
or
ability
to
act
in
contrast
to
the
market
schema
where
even
very
senior
personnel
were
conscious
of
the
limits
of
their
actions
quantifying
subjectivity
relevance
is
the
linchpin
of
producer
control
of
search
engine
quality
recall
that
in
the
most
basic
terms
the
relevant
search
engine
result
provides
answers
to
the
users
questions
yet
doing
this
is
not
simple
operation
since
what
the
user
wants
is
subjective
as
the
following
interviewee
points
out
the
user
customer
conflation
is
clear
in
this
quote
the
interviewee
uses
the
language
of
the
science-technology
schema
as
he
discusses
developing
models
to
figure
out
what
that
subjectivity
is
what
the
interviewees
are
engaged
in
as
they
develop
models
is
process
of
making
an
objective
causal
and
factual
experiment
out
of
the
uncertain
heisenberg
process
of
answering
an
often
not-very-specific
question
on
the
part
of
the
user
for
example
what
is
the
correct
result
for
the
query
new
york
apple
type
of
apple
or
reference
to
the
city
how
about
napa
both
an
auto-parts
chain
and
wine-growing
region
in
california
how
about
abortion
medical
advice
addresses
of
clinics
or
political
issue
the
results
generated
from
this
process
must
be
seen
to
be
objective
and
indeed
google
specifically
defends
its
results
from
accusations
of
inappropriateness
on
this
basis
our
search
results
are
generated
completely
objectively
and
are
independent
of
the
beliefs
and
preferences
of
those
who
work
at
google
google
2004
in
addition
to
being
objective
the
results
must
be
replicable
and
subject
to
improvement
this
process
of
reifying
an
intensely
subjective
choice
is
difficult
moment
for
producers
the
chief
scientist
of
another
large
search
engine
was
working
on
creating
new
type
of
search
algorithm
for
specialist
queries
at
the
time
of
the
interview
he
indicated
that
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
this
work
was
creating
measurable
improvable
model
out
of
subjective
preferences
the
case
where
something
is
brand
new
we
work
very
hard
to
understand
how
we
would
go
about
measuring
it
interviewee
however
once
the
model
is
completed
and
the
subjective
has
become
objective
most
of
the
day-to-day
work
begins
according
to
this
chief
scientist
about
80
of
the
work
they
do
is
incremental
improvements
to
existing
technology
also
called
tuning
the
search
interviewee
is
particularly
enlightening
on
this
topic
as
he
is
the
program
manager
for
search
relevance
at
major
search
engine
he
goes
on
to
describe
in
highly
technical
language
using
specialized
terms
how
quality
as
relevance
is
constructed
we
have
to
use
things
like
precision
recall
at
or
is
like
15
we
have
to
use
all
of
that
good
stuff
that
secondary

we
are
trying

is
completely
subjective
based
on
the
customer
frame
of
mind
so
we
are
of
course
trying
to
develop
models
so
we
can
figure
out
what
that
subjectivity
is
and
therefore
get
our
customers
the
best
thing
that
we
can
do
but
it
is
you
know
all
completely
whatever
they
want
and
it
changes
after
they
look
at
the
first
result
it
can
completely
change
it
little
bit
of
heisenberg
really
that
is
what
it
is
interviewee
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
what
is
model
once
we
have
model
that
is
when
you
start
to
use
things
like
precision
at
you
have
belief
that
these
documents
are
good
for
given
query
now
can
actually
crunch
some
numbers
and
improve
on
that
interviewee
we
assume
that
we
have
got
we
call
them
relevance
judgments
right
or
test
sets
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
so
you
have
been
given
this
test
set
tuning
is
simply
matter
of
optimizing
the
test
set
effectively
it
classification
problem
you
know
dividing
documents
from
your
entire
corpus
into
good
and
bad
interviewee
here
again
the
tuning
process
is
referred
to
via
the
specialized
language
of
information
science
discussing
test
sets
optimization
classifications
and
the
document
corpus
which
are
known
identified
elements
of
information
retrieval
technologies
thus
according
to
this
discourse
although
the
model
for
relevance
is
established
by
interviewing
groups
of
users
to
see
what
really
is
good
and
bad
interviewee
the
day-to-day
management
is
really
pretty
straightforward
and
relatively
boring
scientific
number
crunching
interviewee
this
objective
relevance
judgment
is
then
re-incorporated
into
the
world
of
the
market
by
being
used
as
competitive
measure
to
judge
the
quality
of
other
search
engines
as
the
quote
from
interviewee
earlier
in
this
section
indicated
here
again
relevance
as
measure
which
works
well
within
the
organization
faces
some
strain
from
its
subjective
roots
we
have
people
whose
job
is
based
around
relevance
and
that
is
both
relevance
just
looking
at
the
result
it
also
relevance
looking
at
the
competition
result
and
so
on
because
just
because
it
different
does
not
mean
it
not
relevant
because
sometimes
query
sometimes
it
subjective
too
if
you
don
know
enough
from
query
you
don
know
what
user
looking
for
interviewee
in
the
quote
above
relevance
is
used
as
competitive
yardstick
even
while
its
validity
is
being
questioned
this
was
the
case
in
more
than
one
interview
one
interviewee
who
formerly
worked
in
major
media
conglomerate
as
head
of
search
was
still
shaking
his
head
in
bemusement
years
later
over
why
people
relevance
judgments
were
not
exactly
in
line
with
their
assessment
of
search
engine
quality
we
did
some
studies
internally
when
we
were
doing
some
stuff
at
engine
comparing
how
engine
results
were
compared
to

this
very
mathematical
language
with
the
use
of
and
measures
of
precision
in
information
retrieval
echoes
that
of
interviewee
quoted
earlier
discussing
how
he
can
provedly
improve
search
quality
because
you
can
do
test
and
see
what
is
the
impact
thus
the
account
of
the
day-to-day
process
of
tuning
the
search
engine
is
one
where
the
science-technology
schema
comes
to
the
fore
remember
at
one
point
that
this
experiment
showed
that
our
results
were
actually
better
but
were
being
rated
by
the
users
as
not
as
good
interviewee
the
difficulty
here
is
squaring
results
that
are
actually
better
from
the
objective
point
of
view
of
the
experiment
with
the
subjective
ratings
of
the
users
it
is
vital
for
the
producers
that
the
reified
and
quantified
relevance
not
be
moved
back
to
subjectivity
as
the
following
interviewee
articulates
as
long
as
relevance
is
the
agreed
purely
technical
measure
the
business
side
just
wants
it
to
be
better
as
soon
as
the
definition
is
put
up
for
grabs
or
companies
allow
the
customer
to
say
what
relevance
means
then
sales
and
marketing
begin
to
intervene
in
the
development
of
the
search
product
thus
the
elision
of
relevance
quality
and
customer
satisfaction
elucidated
above
and
in
the
section
on
quality
in
the
market
schema
is
necessary
for
the
producers
to
keep
control
of
the
search
engine
code
the
difficulty
of
articulating
the
public
good
the
last
section
discussed
how
the
quality
metrics
of
customer
satisfaction
and
particularly
relevance
serve
the
strategic
ends
of
producers
helping
them
to
overcome
the
limits
on
their
agency
that
the
market
schema
implies
nonetheless
the
focus
on
relevance
constrains
the
articulation
of
other
quality
goals
for
example
in
journalism
objectivity
fairness
diversity
and
representation
are
typical
examples
of
quality
goals
in
the
course
of
this
research
interviewees
mentioned
many
everyday
practices
in
search
engine
programming
that
could
be
considered
censorship
of
search
results
and
have
the
potential
to
lead
to
biases
in
search
these
included
blacklisting
or
the
exclusion
of
certain
sites
or
site
owners
whitelisting
or
the
automatic
inclusion
of
certain
sites
or
site
owners
weighting
content
according
to
whether
sources
were
considered
to
be
authoritative
or
not
and
adjusting
results
based
on
pressure
from
executives
to
respond
for
example
to
current
news
events
none
of
these
practices
were
considered
problematic
because
all
were
linked
to
obtaining
greater
relevance
in
search
engine
results
not
all
of
the
interviewees
were
entirely
happy
about
this
state
of
affairs
reflecting
the
wider
criticisms
discussed
in
the
introduction
in
two
interviews
and
there
were
hints
of
another
minor
schema
what
we
might
call
public
service

there
are
two
features
as
far
as
relevance
right
one
is
given
query
produce
the
most
relevant
things
that
task
in
and
of
itself
is
to
find
that
level
it
becomes
purely
technical
the
business
side
says
give
us
the
most
relevant
thing
that
is
all
they
care
about
the
related
task
and
this
is
where
you
start
to
see
other
aspects
of
the
company
come
into
play
is
when
you
are
defining
the
language
for
example
you
want
to
allow
the
customer
to
say
what
relevance
means
and
give
them
some
options
that
is
where
various
the
business
and
the
marketing
side
will
start
to
say
ooh
it
would
be
really
great
to
have
xyz
feature
interviewee
schema
emphasizing
equal
access
and
fairness
yet
even
interviewee
who
says
that
the
goal
of
his
search
engine
is
to
be
more
transparent
has
difficult
time
discussing
an
alternative
quality
judgment
such
as
bias
he
introduces
the
topic
into
the
interview
but
also
rejects
it
in
the
same
sentence
which
suggests
that
bias
is
in
conflict
with
other
ideas
about
search
engines
here
the
word
bias
seems
to
be
dissonant
with
the
discursive
objectivity
contained
within
science-technology
schema
discussion
of
the
day-to-day
operation
of
search
engines
another
interviewee
was
asked
what
he
thought
about
people
who
said
that
search
results
were
becoming
too
commercialized
he
refused
to
believe
it
was
an
issue
this
is
not
an
example
of
the
commercialization
of
search
but
of
the
commercialization
of
documents
available
on
the
web
mean
if
there
are
only
commercial
documents
on
the
web
then
even
noncommercial
search
engine
will
come
up
with
list
of
commercial
documents
interviewee
however
if
there
were
to
be
an
issue
he
goes
on
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
technical
and
infrastructural
in
nature
see
the
bigger
problem
being
centralization
the
crucial
part
of
your
infrastructure
is
centralized
that
is
you
introduce
single
point
of
failure
interviewee
the
idea
of
technical
solution
is
echoed
by
another
interviewee
whose
utopian
vision
of
the
solution
to
potential
problem
of
bias
or
the
over-commercialization
of
search
included
not
only
perfect
technology
but
also
education
and
literacy
distributed
throughout
the
world
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
create
world
of
educated
thinking
people
then
the
ads
will
have
no
effect
and
we
don
need
to
be
concerned
with
what
the
corporations
do
you
need
to
look
at
it
in
longer
timespan
advertising
is
just
feature
of
particular
stage
in
evolution
technology
will
get
to
point
where
there
is
big
space
and
so
you
need
to
make
the
profit
on
the
difference
and
the
quality
and
yes
there
will
be
popular
things
but
the
technology
will
distribute
everything
to
everyone
who
needs
it
and
everyone
will
be
able
to
find
what
they
like
that
much
better
than
regulation
interviewee
perhaps
more
common
is
the
view
of
third
engineer
who
simply
suggested
that
if
search
engines
were
censoring
their
results
they
were
doing
it
for
the
good
of
the
population

don
think
that
major
search
engines
today
are
horribly
biased
but
they
re
also
not
objective
and
the
more
you
operate
secretively
it
makes
it
harder
for
people
to
see
where
you
re
subjective
maybe
subjective
is
better
word
than
biased
although
it
pretty
much
means
the
same
thing
interviewee
when
you
get
into
this
logic
unfortunately
that
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
right
you
have
this
free
resource
people
with
this
mindset
will
actually
go
and
use
it
all
and
destroy
the
value
so
it
the
same
for
the
web
think
search
engines
are
totally
justified
to
not
be
kind
on
those
spammers
sorry
getting
little
excited
here
interviewee
conclusion
the
research
questions
that
began
this
article
were
first
how
do
search
engine
producers
conceive
of
quality
and
second
what
are
the
implications
of
these
conceptions
of
quality
for
the
future
development
of
search
engines
the
evidence
from
the
interviews
examined
in
this
article
suggests
that
search
engine
producers
conceive
of
quality
in
two
separate
but
interrelated
ways
first
quality
search
engine
from
the
producer
perspective
has
high
customer
satisfaction
this
definition
of
search
quality
is
embedded
in
larger
cultural
schema
that
have
called
the
market
schema
in
which
search
engines
are
primarily
conceived
of
as
businesses
second
quality
search
engine
produces
very
relevant
responses
to
queries
again
this
definition
of
quality
is
related
to
the
cultural
schema
that
have
characterized
as
science
technology
search
engines
from
the
science-technology
point
of
view
are
primarily
pieces
of
engineering
the
implications
of
these
conceptions
of
quality
are
far
reaching
precisely
because
they
are
embedded
in
larger
cultural
schemas
structuration
theory
emphasizes
how
cultural
schemas
and
their
associated
norms
guide
the
allocation
of
resources
this
article
has
shown
that
in
the
case
of
search
engines
several
schemas
are
at
work
simultaneously
the
schemas
clearly
in
the
ascendant
the
dominant
market
schema
and
the
science-technology
schema
provide
little
scope
to
raise
issues
of
public
welfare
fairness
or
bias
instead
they
emphasize
profit
in
the
case
of
the
market
schema
or
progress
and
efficiency
in
the
case
of
the
science-technology
schema
or
defense
in
the
case
of
the
war
schema
key
feature
of
cultural
schemas
is
that
they
are
generalizable
or
as
sewell
puts
it
drawing
from
bourdieu
transposable
that
is
that
they
can
be
applied
to
wide
and
not
fully
predictable
range
of
cases
outside
the
context
where
they
are
initially
learned
1992
17
the
market
science
and
war
are
precisely
such
transposable
allegories
whose
demands
constrain
the
pursuit
of
alternate
standards
of
search
quality
for
as
giddens
1984
and
sewell
1992
both
note
schemas
are
crucial
elements
of
structure
that
mobilize
resources
on
behalf
of
their
users
as
the
search
engine
producers
discovered
the
market
schema
is
especially
productive
when
it
comes
to
mobilizing
resources
within
the
pre-existing
structure
of
business

defends
the

in
the
quote
above
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
quality
schemas
including
ideas
of
full
disclosure
representativeness
or
diversity
operate
at
tangent
to
the
way
in
which
producers
primarily
frame
their
work

according
to
the

2004
women
made
up
27
of
the

in

including

of

producers
however
do
not
feel
that
they
are
experts
in
the
market
they
may
be
engineers
researchers
or
designers
and
they
may
have
become
managers
or
even
business
owners
over
the
years
as
happened
to
several
of
the
interviewees
nevertheless
they
do
not
identify
themselves
as
business
people
and
when
working
on
search
engines
they
felt
that
their
ability
to
affect
major
features
of
search
was
circumscribed
as
soon
as
their
companies
began
to
make
significant
amounts
of
money
from
the
search
they
act
discursively
to
reclaim
their
abilities
to
control
search
by
acting
as
experts
on
an
objective
measure
of
search
quality
which
is
in
turn
linked
to
customer
satisfaction
and
therefore
revenue
thus
although
search
engine
producers
like
all
other
cultural
actors
have
multiplicity
of
transposable
schemas
at
their
disposal
examples
might
include
art
public
service
family
or
many
others
the
implication
is
that
these
schemas
are
not
simple
matter
of
choice
they
have
real
material
consequences
for
their
users
structuration
theory
indicates
that
technological
schemas
and
associated
norms
will
have
an
effect
on
how
resources
are
directed
within
society
helping
to
maintain
old
structures
or
create
new
ones
in
this
case
it
is
clear
that
considerable
amount
of
resources
are
dedicated
to
maintaining
search
quality
in
the
forms
of
relevance
and
customer
satisfaction
structuration
theory
also
indicates
that
pre-existing
structures
such
as
corporate
hierarchy
or
indeed
capitalism
as
whole
will
profoundly
influence
which
kinds
of
technological
schemas
and
norms
become
widespread
in
these
interviews
the
minor
public
service
schema
provides
potential
alternative
to
the
market
and
science-technology
schemas
however
the
difficulty
its
proponents
have
in
articulating
it
as
well
as
the
opposition
of
others
to
hearing
it
articulated
suggest
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
build
up
an
alternative
kind
of
structure
within
which
search
engines
could
operate
