abstract-neural
network
models
have
been
widely
applied
in
the
field
of
information
retrieval
but
their
vulnerability
has
always
been
significant
concern
in
retrieval
of
public
topics
the
problems
posed
by
the
vulnerability
are
not
only
returning
inaccurate
or
irrelevant
content
but
also
returning
manipulated
opinions

potentially

weakening
the
reliability
of

and

the

of

we

demonstrate
the

then
we

in
which
each

independently
rated
the

of
the

the
unmanipulated

the

that

furthermore
we
preliminarily
propose
countermeasures
to
address
the
issue
of

and
build
more
reliable

introduction
the

opinion
has
always
been
susceptible
to
the

the
issues
arising
from
the
reliability
defect
in
information
retrieval
models
go
beyond
returning
irrelevant

it
is
known
that
the

within
the

has
become
scholarly
concern
for
long
time

phenomenon
in
the
information
presented
by
online

29
it
is
typically
because

that
provide
biased

24
public

often
involve
opinions
from
different

on
the

neverthe

the

can
lead
to
the
homogenization

if
the

for

exhibit
semantically
similar
or
consistent
opinions
instead
of
opinions
from
different

the

may
make
users
perceive
these

as

consequently
users
are
likely
to
only
consider
these

distinction
between
information

and
the

lies
that
the
emergence
of
the

is
driven
by

generally
stems

moreover

literature
review
there
has
been
considerable
amount
of
research
on
manip
ulating
information
retrieval
results
scholars
have
attempted
various
methods
to
manipulate
information
effectively
the
fundamental
principle
of
manipulation
in
the
ranking
scenario
is
to
enhance
the
relevance
of
target
ranking
candidates
to
the
query
ensuring
their
top
positions
in
the
final
ranking
the
targets
to
be
manipulated
typically
include
the
ranking
model
the
query
and
the
candidate
items
however
as
manipulators
find
it
challenging
to
modify
user
queries
in
practice
and
are
unable
to
know
the
details
of
the
ranking
model
this
paper
primarily
focuses
on
manipulating
the
ranking
of
candidate
items
boosting
their

information

can
be
classified
based
on
the

conditions
depending
on
the

un

manipulation
methods
can
be
categorized
into
white-box

and
black-box
approaches
18

the
focus
of
this
paper
is
to
manipulate
the
ranking
results
of
information
retrieval
models
under
the
white
box
setting
as
starting
from
the
most
basic
white
box
setting
can
lay
the
foundation
for
future
research
on
manipulating
opinions
closer
to
the
real
world
under
white
box
setting
manipulators
can
access
information
such
as
the
architecture
parameters
and
internal
data
transmission
of
the
information
retrieval
model
essentially
commanding
complete
knowledge
of
the
model
therefore
information
manipulation
under
white-box
setting
is
the
simplest
under
black-box
setting
manipulators
can
only
obtain
the
output
of
the
target
model
with
other
information
being
unknown
gray-box

falls

and

information
retrieval
models
and
their
robustness
eval
uation
early
information
retrieval
models
adopted
traditional
mod
els
based
on
exact
word
matching
these
models
typically
use
statistical
metrics
such
as
term
frequency
inverse
docu
ment
frequency
or
combinations
of
some
metrics
to
calculate
relevance
scores
representative
example
is
the
bm25
best
match
weighting
function
implemented
in
okapi
algorithm
proposed
by
robertson
in
1994
26
which
comprehensively
considers
the
importance
of
words
the
correlation
between
words
and
documents
and
the
correlation
between
words
and
queries
the
advantage
of
such
traditional
models
lies
in
their
processing
speed
making
the
bm25
algorithm
widely
used
in
large-scale
document
retrieval
and
recall
tasks
however
the
drawback
of
traditional
models
is
the
inability
to
match
all
the
occurring
words
and
they
struggle
with
handling
polysemy
as
well
as
learning
about
semantic-level
correlations
later
people
adopted
feature-based
ranking
models
trained
by
supervised
training
with
pre-constructed
features
these
features
can
be
statistical
text-based
or
matching
features
between
documents
and
queries
the
difference
between
feature-based
models
and
traditional
ranking
models
is
that
traditional
models
are
generally
unsupervised
while
feature
based
ranking
models
are
trained
with
supervised
learning
algorithms
such
as
svm
decision
trees
etc
feature-based
models
enhance
the
retrieval
accuracy
by
supervised
training
but
their
ability
to
model
semantic
matching
between
queries
and
candidate
documents
remains
insufficient
people
have
gradually
turned
to
using
neural
network
models
as
ranking
models
because
of
its
powerful
modeling
capability
to
explore
semantic
relationships
between
queries
and
candidate
documents
resulting
more
accurate
matching
the
modeling
capacity
of
neural
network
is
generally
pro
portional
to
their
scale
of
parameters
so
adopting
pre-trained
models
can
maintain
strong
ranking
modeling
capability
while
reducing
the
cost
of
fine-tuning
therefore
pre-trained
models
have
become
the
mainstream
in
current

32

most
of
the
reliability

research
approached
the
issue
from
the
attack
perspective
detecting
vulnerabilities
of
target
models
by
perturbation
and
distortion
nevertheless
there
is
comparatively
less
research
from
the
defense
or
user
perspective
in
nlp
the
evaluation
of
model
vulnerabilities
from
the
attack
perspective
begins
with
rule-based
heuristic
methods
robin
et
al
15
employ
two
methods
to
construct
perturbation
texts
in
reading
comprehension
and
question
answering
tasks
the
first
is
under
black-box
setting
they
apply
word
replace
ment
to
the
target
question
and
create
fake
answer
to
it
with
predefined
types
generating
the
natural
perturbation
text
via
crowd-sourcing
the
second
is
under
gray-box
setting
the
method
also
constructs
perturbation
text
by
word
replacement
but
it
utilizes
predicted
probability
optimization
of
the
target
model
to
get
the
final
perturbation
sample
the
first
method
mentioned
relies
too
much
on
rules
and
pre-defined
patterns
while
the
second
generates
perturbation
text
with
insufficient
semantic
fluency
moreover
these
two
methods
tend
to
directly
construct
perturbation
text
with
the
words
in
the
question
making
the
perturbation
text
easily
detectable
the
method
proposed
by
robin
et
al
to
evaluation
the
vulnerabilities
of
model
is
based
on
an
observation
applying
certain
perturbations
to
an
image
does
not
change
its
semantics
in
cv
while
even
slight
modification
to
text
can
completely
alter
its
meaning
in
nlp
during
the
manipulation
process
we
expect
that
the
manipulated
text
retains
its
original
semantics
but
it
is
required
to
deceive
the
target
model
under
white-box
setting
ebrahimi
et
al
utilize
an
atomic
flip
operation
which
swaps
one
token
for
an
other
to
generate
perturbation
examples
and
the
method
known
as
hotflip
hotflip
gets
rid
of
reliance
on
rules
but
the
perturbation
text
it
generate
usually
has
incomplete
semantics
and
insufficient
grammar
fluency
while
it
can
deceive
the
target
model
it
cannot
evade
perplexity-based
defenses
to
further
enhance
the
quality
of
perturbation
text
song
et

30
propose
an
similar
method
under
white-box
setting
named
collision
which
uses
gradient
optimization
and
beam
search
to
produce
the
perturbation
text
named
collision
the
collision
method
further
imposes
soft
constraint
on
collision
genera
tion
by
integrating
language
model
reducing
the
perplexity
of
the
collision
the
method
has
shown
promising
results
in
document
retrieval
experiments
inspired
by
collisions
liu
et

propose
the
pairwise
anchor-based
trigger
pat
method
under
black-box
setting
added
the
fluency
constraint
and
the
next
sentence
prediction
constraint
the
method
generates
perturbation
text
by
optimizing
the
pairwise
loss
of
top
candidates
and
target
candidates
with
perturbation
text
although
the
time
complexity
of
pat
has
increased
compared
to
previous
methods
pat
takes
ranking
similarity
and
semantic
consistency
into
account
so
its
manipulation
effect
on
the
retrieval
ranking
of
the
target
candidates
is
superior
this
paper
mainly
adopts
collisions
and
pat
methods
to
manipulate
the
opinions
on
public
topics
evaluating
the
reliability
and
fairness
of
opinion
retrieval
stance
detection
the
relevant
information
retrieved
in
public
topics
may
include
opinions
with
neutral
stance
or
content
without
opin
ions
at
all
so
it
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
there
are
opinions
in
the

kind
of

classification
task
called

stance
detection
are
generally
divided
into
two
categories
feature-based
detection
and
data-driven
machine
learning
detection
feature-based
detection
often
requires
people
to
construct
features
such
as
special
words
used
in
the
controversy
the
author
social
activities
and
so
on
however
these
constructed
features
such
as
special
words
and
bag
of
words
are
difficult
to
reflect
the
whole
semantic
or
even
the
attitude
of
the
text
machine
learning
methods
for
stance
detection
can
be
categorized
into
four
types
supervised
learning
unsupervised
learning
weakly
supervised
learning
and
transfer
learning
in
the
early
days
supervised
learning
methods
for
stance
detec
tion
used
svm
lr
knn
and
other
techniques
however
with
the
widespread
use
of
neural
networks
recurrent
neural
networks
including
lstm
and
gru
have
become
mainstream
stance
detection
models
wei-fan
chen
et
al
have
even
employed
cnn
to
extract
stance
features
further
enhancing
the
effectiveness
of
stance
detection
while
supervised
learn
ing
enables
models
to
effectively
learn
about
knowledge
of
stance
it
requires
large
amount
of
labeled
data
to
achieve
satisfactory
results
at
the
same
time
the
cost
of
training
increases
with
the
growth
of
data
and
there
may
even
be
issues
like
over-fitting
therefore
other
scholars
have
explored
unsupervised
learning
weakly
supervised
learning
and
other
methods
for
stance
detection
unsupervised
stance
detection
is
either
based
on
user
features
such
as
posting
history
or
relies
on
certain
rules
or
grammatical
dependencies
but
neither
aligns
with
the
text-based
requirements
of
this
paper
weakly
supervised
stance
detection
typically
use
small
amount
of
labeled
data
to
train
simple
classifier
which
is
then
used
to
annotate
unlabeled
data
for
further
training
however
the
method
is
not
ideal
for
stance
detection
with
the
remarkable
effectiveness
of
transfer
learning
pow
erful
pre-trained
models
like
gpt
bert
elmo
etc
have
emerged
people
increasingly
use
pre-trained
models
trained
on

from
other
domains
to

of
the

methods
based
on

additionally
fine-tuning

this
example
illustrates
how
the
opinion

can
significantly
alter
the
ranking
of

results
the

consists
of
some
coloured
squares
and
its

is
the

moreover
it
can
be
observed
that
different
manipulation
methods
have
varying
effects
on
the
manipulation
of
opinion
candidates
the
perturbation
text
tpat
generated
by
the
pat
demonstrates
the
best
manipulation
effect
on
opinions
with
different
stances
in
public
topics
it
achieves
the
highest
average
percentage
for
both
top
candidate

and
top
10
candidate
items
after
opinion
manipulation
and
it
achieves
the
greatest
increase
in
ndcg
values
for
final

the
manipulation
effect
of
tnat
is
worse
than
tpat
but
its
scores
on
apct
abr
and
ndcgv
indicators
are
relatively
close
to
those
of
the
tpat
the
manipulation
effect
of
taggr
is
the
worst
with
relatively
small
increase
in
the
rankings
of
target
candidate
items
that
is
because
collisions
generates
taggr
solely
based
on
gradient
optimization
creating
pertur
bation
texts
that
are
usually
nonsensical
these
texts
often
contain
meaningless
characters
limiting
its
deceptive
effect
on
retrieval
ranking
models
in
contrast
tnat
adds
semantic
constraints
resulting
in
more
fluent
perturbation
texts
with
stronger
deceptive
effect
on
retrieval
ranking
models
pat
goes
further
on
the
basis
of
tnat
by
taking
information
from
candidate
items
into
account
adding
constraints
of
consistency
between
the
preceding
sentences
and
following
sentences
and
using
anchor
candidates
to
construct
perturbation
texts
by
pairwise
contrastive
learning
tpat
exhibits
stronger
semantic
consistency
with
the
query
and
the
target
candidate
item
moreover
the
gradient-based
pairwise
learning
allows
pat
to
better
identify

in

and
group
moreover
participants
in
group
perceived
higher
credibility
for
the
topics
compared
to
group
it
is
because
after
inserting
perturbation
text
into
the
target
candidate
items
the
retrieval
model
ranked
candidate
items
which
endorsed
the
authenticity
of
the
public
topics
higher
at
the
top
increasing
participants
trust
in
the
topic
and
leading
to
change
in
the
stances
of
their
opinions
this
experiment
answers
the
second
research
question
confirming
that
automated
manipulation
of
opinions
ranking
is
effectively
impacting
users
perceptions
of
public
topics
vi
discussion
and
conclusion
in
retrieval
of
public
topics
this
paper
proposes
to
manip
ulate
the
ranking
of
opinion
candidates
in
search
results
by
exploiting
the
reliability
vulnerabilities
of
information
retrieval
models
the
aim
of
the
manipulation
is
to
influence
users
stances
on
public
topics
in
the
experiment
it
is
demonstrated
that
automated
manipulation
of
opinions
ranking
is
achiev
able
additionally
to
further
clarify
whether
this
manipulation
can
effectively
impact
users
perception
we
design
user
experiment
different
subject
groups
simulated
retrieval
for
public
topics
before
and
after
opinion
manipulation
providing
feedback
on
the
perceived
credibility
of
the
topics
the
results
indicate
that
manipulating
the
opinion
ranking
significantly
impacts
users
stance
on
the
target
topics
which
means
reliability
vulnerability
and
unfair
ranking
in
opinion
retrieval
have
potential
huge
risks
to
address
the
retrieval
reliability
and
ranking
fairness
problems
caused
by
opinion
manipulation
in
public
topics
if
it
happens
in
reality
our
goal
should
be
to
fairly
display
diverse
opinions
with
different
stances
therefore
the
retrieval
task
on
public
topics
should
not
rely
solely
on
ranking
candidates
based
on
semantic
relevance
to
the
query
currently
most
per
turbations
on
information
retrieval
models
manipulate
rankings
by
disrupting
the
relevance
judgment
of
the
models
so
we
can
divide
the
retrieval
of
public
topics
into
two
stages
in
the
first
stage
certain
number
of
relevant
candidate
items
are
obtained
based
on
relevance
and
form
relevant
item
set
in
the
second
stage
the
stance
detector
is
used
to
detect
the
stances
of
candidate
items
within
the
set
the
ranking
of
those
candidate
items
is
achieved
based
on
the
combination
of
the
candidates
stances
and
their
relevance
to
the
query
we
can
design
algorithms
to
ensure
that
opinion
candidate
items
with
various
stances
are
able
to
rank
as
high
as
possible
however
this
method
also
brings
the
issue
of
reliability
in
the
stance
detector
for
further
exploration
additionally
we
can
explore
clustering
methods
or
other
methods
to
summarize
opinions
with
various
stances
on
public
topics
and
present
them
to
users
in
visualization
ways
aiding
users
in
gaining
more
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
related
stances
on
public
topic
in
conclusion
we
investigate
the
manipulating
the
ranking
list
of
opinion
candidate
items
to
influence
users
perspectives
on
public
topics
in
this
paper
the
feasibility
of
manipulation
and
the
effectiveness
of
its
impact
on
user
perception
have
been
explored
by
empirical
experiments
however
the
manip
ulation
methods
employed
in
this
paper
are
relatively
simple
and
there
is
room
for
further
improvement
in
the
opinion
manipulation
effects
thus
the
assessment
of
reliability
defect
in
information
retrieval
models
are
not
enough
furthermore
with
the
widespread
use
of
large
language
models
llms
many
information
retrieval
tasks
are
now
being
combined
with
llms
we
will
delve
into
opinion
manipulation
based
on
llms
retrieval
comprehensively
exploring
the
retrieval
reliability
and
ranking
fairness
issues
when
llms
is
employed
for
opinion
retrieval
tasks
addressing
potential
ethical
concerns
our
objective
is
to
enhance
the
resilience
of
ranking
models
throughout
our
research
we
adhered
to
the
acm
ethical
code
to
mitigate
any
potential
harm
it
is
true
that
the
tech
niques
devised
in
this
paper
could
be
misused
to
attack
current
ir
systems
using
triggers
or
adversarial
attacks
resulting
in
potential
short-term
negative
consequences
nevertheless
it
is
not
our
intention
to
inflict
harm
upon
ranking
models
instead
we
aim
to
publicly
disclose
these
unintentional
flaws
enabling
the
development
of
novel
defense
algorithms
to
safeguard
against
them
in
the
future
this
approach
mirrors
the
actions
of
white
hat
hackers
who
publicly
expose
bugs
or
vulnerabilities
in
software
we
have
demonstrated
that
automatic
information
manip
ulation
of
information
retrieval
results
can
be
accomplished
which
reveals
greater
threat
than
previous
manual
operation
10
this
indicates
our
work
provides
long-term
benefit
to
the
community
and
can
help
to
improve
ir
systems
more
importantly
we
minimized
real-world
harm
by
not
exposing
any
real-world
failure
or
damage
to
any
real
users
